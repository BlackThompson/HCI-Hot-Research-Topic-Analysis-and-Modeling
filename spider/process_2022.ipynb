      " If you were significantly impacted by an algorithmic decision, how would you want the decision to be reviewed? In this study, we explore perceptions of review processes for algorithmic decisions that differ across three dimensions: the reviewer, how the review is conducted, and how long the review takes. Using a choice-based conjoint analysis we find that people prefer review processes that provide for human review, the ability to participate in the review process, and a timely outcome. Using a survey, we find that people also see human review that provides for participation to be the fairest review process. Our qualitative analysis indicates that the fairest review process provides the greatest likelihood of a favourable outcome, an opportunity for the decision subject and their situation to be fully and accurately understood, human involvement, and dignity. These findings have implications for the design of contestation procedures and also the design of algorithmic decision-making processes.\n",

      "To learn how to self-direct research, students must learn to reflect and improve upon a diverse set of metacognitive skills. Models like Agile Research Studios (ARS) provide ecosystems of tools and processes designed to help students hone their reflection skills as they practice research. However, students still struggle to enact their reflection processes across the supports available to them, as mentors coach them to do. MindYoga integrates a process framework that helps students monitor and enact their metacognitive reflection process across an ARS ecosystem. Findings show students using MindYoga were (1) able to monitor which metacognitive risks may affect their upcoming project work, (2) able to develop action plans based on mentor feedback to address these risks, and (3) actively reminded of their action items during relevant practice sessions. Moving forward, process frameworks like MindYoga can help learners develop and improve their work processes as they practice within learning ecosystems. \n",

      " The ability to consider a wide range of solutions to a design problem is a crucial skill for designers, and is a major differentiator between experts and novices. One reason for this is that novices are unaware of the full extent of the design space in which solutions are situated. To support novice designers with design space exploration, we introduce Mixplorer, a system that allows designers to take an initial design and mix it with other designs. Mixplorer differs from existing tools by supporting the exploration of ill-defined design spaces through social design space exploration. To evaluate Mixplorer, we conducted (1) an interview study with design instructors who reported that Mixplorer would “help to open the minds” of novice designers and (2) a controlled experiment with novices, finding that the design-mixing functionality of Mixplorer provided significantly better support for creativity, and that participants who mixed designs produced more novel designs.\n",

      " For non-sport fans, perceiving the excitement of surrounding fan groups and the arousal of collective emotions are some of the crucial factors that motivate their engaged excitement and loyalty in a sport; these factors are closely related to the process of evolution from a non-fan to a fan. The global COVID-19 pandemic changed the way of sport-watching from watching at the arena to watching from home alone. This has highlighted significant difficulties in the excitement transmission and arousal channel between non-sport fans and fans. Previous remote emotional intervening mediums had been limited to the use of virtual avatars to convey partners’ external cues (such as appearance), to enhance the sense of presence from visual-audio perspectives. In this study, we explored a novel remote emotional intervening medium that conveys sport-fans’ internal cues (bio-signals) that are widely believed to be related to internal emotional states of human, and displays those signals in a way that gives non-sport fans a deeper and more immersive experience: haptic feedback experience. Three bio-signal-based haptic feedback prototypes were developed, including heart-rate-based vibration, electromyography (EMG)-based pressure, and skin-temperature-based thermal feedbacks. An exploratory pilot study was conducted on a group of non-sport fans in a lab-control environment of remote-sport-watching to explore the effectiveness of the proposed mediums in enhancing their perception of sport-fan’s excitement (emotion perception). Besides, we also analyzed non-sport fans’ heart rate data when they were participants in the experiments to measure the performance of the proposed mediums in evoking the engaged excitement of non-sport fans (emotion arousal). Our results indicate the outstanding ability of EMG-based pressure feedback in effectively enhancing the process of emotion perception and the notable advantage of heart-rate-based vibration feedback in the arousal of non-sport fans’ engaged excitement. This study presents the potential utility of bio-signal-based haptic feedback in augmenting remote emotional perception and arousal and also provides the underlining support for the future exploration and development directions for social computing based on bio-signals and haptic technologies.\n",

      " Effective data literacy instruction requires that learners move beyond understanding statistics to being able to humanize data through a contextual understanding of argumentation and reasoning in the real-world. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a co-designed data comic unit about adolescent friendships. The 7th grade unit involved students analyzing data graphs about adolescent friendships and crafting comic narratives to convey perspectives on that data. Findings from our analysis of 33 student comics, and interviews with two teachers and four students, show that students engaged in various forms of data reasoning and social-emotional reasoning. These findings contribute an understanding of how students make sense of data about personal, everyday experiences; and how an arts-integrated curriculum can be designed to support their mutual engagement in both data and social-emotional reasoning. \n",

      " Although the interaction capability of soft sensors has been explored in the field of HCI, they are found to have limitations in shape, wiring management, and softness due to the characteristics of the material. In this paper, we propose a design of 3D-printed resistive soft sensors that can detect deformation by creating internal lattice structures with flexible conductive materials. The magnitude of deformation can be detected by measuring the resistance between a pair of electrodes. By adjusting the parameters of the lattice structure, a soft sensor with high flexibility of shape design and adjustable local softness can be realized. In addition, by inserting non-conductive structures into the sensor structure, external wires can be consolidated in one place. We present a design and fabrication pipeline, and investigate the fundamental characteristics of several patterns of sensors. We also show several applications that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.\n",

      " Smartphones continue to proliferate throughout our daily lives, not only in sheer quantity but also in their ever-growing list of uses. In addition to communication and entertainment, smartphones can also be used as a credit card to make a contactless payment on Kiosk Systems, such as ordering food, printing tickets and self-checkout. When a user holds the phone close to the Kiosk system to present payment credentials, we propose to also verify the user’s identity based on a photo of the back of their smartphone gripping hand, which provides a second security layer. Compared to the widely used facial recognition, the proposed approach addresses the recent struggles of identifying faces under masks and the public concerns of potential privacy erosion, racial bias and misuse. We find that the geometry of each individual’s hand, when it grips a phone, is identifiable and then design a vision-based approach to extract the gripping hand biometrics. In particular, we develop hand image processing schemes to detect and localize the gripping hand while denoising and normalizing the hand images (e.g., size and color). Furthermore, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm to distinguish smartphone users’ gripping hand images for authentication. Experiments with 20 participants show that the system achieves 99.5% accuracy for user verification.\n",

Paradoxically, these data-rich environments have also resulted in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that fit poorly into clinical contexts, and increase health workers cognitive load. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to designing CDSSs that are embedded in clinical workflows, by presenting problem-based curated data views tailored for problem-driven discovery, team communication, and situational awareness. We describe the design and evaluation of one such CDSS, In-Sight, that embodies our approach and addresses the clinical problem of monitoring critically ill pediatric patients. Our work is the result of a co-design process, further informed by empirical data collected through formal usability testing, focus groups, and a simulation study with domain experts. We discuss the potential and limitations of our approach, and share lessons learned in our iterative co-design process. \n",

      "Here we present a co-design exploration into the potential of technology to playfully re-signify urban spaces. We created a speculative catalog of urban tech and used it to facilitate multi-stakeholder discussions about the playful potential of smart cities. The learnings from our co-design engagements embody different people's ideas of how tech might and might not support rich forms of urban play, and contribute to ongoing efforts at exploring how to playfully reconfigure our cities. We present: (1) a list of inspirational play potentials of urban spaces—i.e. playful things already people do, and enjoy, in the public space; (2) a portfolio of speculative ideas that show how tech might help to realize that potential; and (3) a discussion of stakeholders’ responses to these ideas. Our work can provide designers with inspiration and actionable advice for cultivating forms of urban play that cater to people's socio-emotional needs.\n",

      "Context-aware applications have the potential to act opportunistically to facilitate human experiences and activities, from reminding us of places to perform personal activities, to identifying coincidental moments to engage in digitally-mediated shared experiences. However, despite the availability of context-detectors and programming frameworks for defining how such applications should trigger, designers lack support for expressing their human concepts of a situation and the experiences and activities they afford (e.g., situations to toss a frisbee) when context-features are made available at the level of locations (e.g., parks). This paper introduces Affinder, a block-based programming environment that supports constructing concept expressions that effectively translate their conceptions of a situation into a machine representation using available context features. During pilot testing, we discovered three bridging challenges that arise when expressing situations that cannot be encoded directly by a single context-feature. To overcome these bridging challenges, Affinder provides designers (1) an unlimited vocabulary search for discovering features they may have forgotten; (2) prompts for reflecting and expanding their concepts of a situation and ideas for foraging for context-features; and (3) simulation and repair tools for identifying and resolving issues with the precision of concept expressions on real use-cases. In a comparison study, we found that Affinder’s core functions helped designers stretch their concepts of how to express a situation, find relevant context-features matching their concepts, and recognize when the concept expression operated differently than intended on real-world cases. These results show that Affinder and tools that support bridging can improve a designer’s ability to express their concepts of a human situation into detectable machine representations—thus pushing the boundaries of how computing systems support our activities in the world. \n",

      "Existing conversational approaches for Internet of Things (IoT) service mashup do not support modification because of the usability challenge, although it is common for users to modify the service mashups in IoT environments. To support the modification of IoT service mashups through conversational interfaces in a usable manner, we propose the conversational mashup modification agent (CoMMA). Users can modify IoT service mashups using CoMMA through natural language conversations. CoMMA has a two-step mashup modification interaction, an implicature-based localization step, and a modification step with a disambiguation strategy. The localization step allows users to easily search for a mashup by vocalizing their expressions in the environment. The modification step supports users to modify mashups by speaking simple modification commands. We conducted a user study and the results show that CoMMA is as effective as visual approaches in terms of task completion time and perceived task workload for modifying IoT service mashups. \n",

      "We present Lattice Menu, a gaze-based marking menu utilizing a lattice of visual anchors that helps perform accurate gaze pointing for menu item selection. Users who know the location of the desired item can leverage target-assisted gaze gestures for multilevel item selection by looking at visual anchors over the gaze trajectories. Our evaluation showed that Lattice Menu exhibits a considerably low error rate (~1%) and a quick menu selection time (1.3-1.6 s) for expert usage across various menu structures (4 × 4 × 4 and 6 × 6 × 6) and sizes (8, 10 and 12°). In comparison with a traditional gaze-based marking menu that does not utilize visual targets, Lattice Menu showed remarkably (~5 times) fewer menu selection errors for expert usage. In a post-interview, all 12 subjects preferred Lattice Menu, and most subjects (8 out of 12) commented that the provisioning of visual targets facilitated more stable menu selections with reduced eye fatigue. \n",

      " Gaze and speech are rich contextual sources of information that, when combined, can result in effective and rich multimodal interactions. This paper proposes a machine learning-based pipeline that leverages and combines users’ natural gaze activity, the semantic knowledge from their vocal utterances and the synchronicity between gaze and speech data to facilitate users’ interaction. We evaluated our proposed approach on an existing dataset, which involved 32 participants recording voice notes while reading an academic paper. Using a Logistic Regression classifier, we demonstrate that our proposed multimodal approach maps voice notes with accurate text passages with an average F1-Score of 0.90. Our proposed pipeline motivates the design of multimodal interfaces that combines natural gaze and speech patterns to enable robust interactions. \n",

      "Through collaborative playlists (CPs), streaming platform users have co-curated music together for various purposes for over a decade. As the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how people come together through technology and engage with music, CPs have also taken on new roles and value. To understand how CP usage and perception have evolved since the onset of COVID-19, we conducted a mixed-methods investigation of CPs in the United States. Survey results from primarily CP users (N=142) revealed that interest in and usage of CPs have mostly increased since the pandemic, and that the role of music in connecting with others is positively correlated with the perceived impact of COVID-19. Follow-up interviews (N=9) provided additional insights into changing perceptions and usage patterns of CPs during COVID-19; for instance, fewer collaborators per playlist reflects users’ greater focus on strengthening social connections and relationships. Taken together, findings and design implications on digitally mediated co-curation further elucidate the necessity for social and collaborative experiences with music supported by CPs during COVID-19.\n",

In the research itself, workers may be invited to participate in computing research, but they seldom determine the goals of projects nor do they own the results. Ultimately, while government agencies and nonprofit organizations claim to seek improved conditions for workers, the knowledge and technologies produced through this research serve primarily to undermine the power of working class people and their unions.\n",

To adapt to the changing climate, Detroit is modernizing its sewer infrastructure, adding sensors, robotics, and advanced algorithms that have the potential to increase the capacity and adaptability of its sewer system. The water utility is struggling, however, to incorporate these new technologies into its existing user workflows. We have conducted a user study of water operators in Detroit focused on understanding how they currently visualize and use one of their most critical data sources — weather data. Based on our findings, we have developed a new weather dashboard that minimizes weather data uncertainty by synthesizing multiple sources. This research aims to inform the design of new data interfaces for water operators, and learn best practices for incorporating uncertain data in data-driven decision-making processes.\n",

This work investigates how we might integrate touchless technologies into public-space infrastructure in order to minimise physical interaction with shared devices in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on an ethnographic exploration into how public utilities are being used, adapted or avoided, we developed and evaluated a suite of technology probes that can be either retrofitted into, or replace, these services. In-situ community deployments of our probes demonstrate strong uptake and provide insight into how hands-free technologies can be adapted and utilised for the public domain; and, in turn, used to inform the future of walk-up-and use public technologies.\n",

      " In interactive story games, players make decisions that advance and modify the unfolding story. In many cases, these decisions have a moral component. Examining decision-making in these games illuminates whether players mobilize their real-life morality to make in-game decisions and what impact this has in both the game world and real life. Using mixed-methods consisting of semi-structured interviews and the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ30), we collected data from 19 participants who played the game Detroit: Become Human. We analyzed how participants applied their real-life morals toward in-game decisions using thematic analysis and statistical analysis of the MFQ30 results. Qualitative findings indicate that participants mobilize their moral intuitions to make in-game decisions and how much participants cared about their game characters influenced their choices. We contribute a better understanding of how players react to moral dilemmas in interactive story games for game designers to help them improve player experience.\n",

App and Permission Limiters were significantly more concerned about perceived surveillance than Privacy Balancers and the Privacy Unconcerned. App Limiters had the lowest number of apps installed on their devices with the lowest intention of using apps and sharing information with them, compared to Permission Limiters who had the highest number of apps installed and reported higher intention to share information with apps. The four profiles reflect the differing privacy management strategies, perceptions, and intentions of Android users that go beyond the binary decision to share or withhold information via mobile apps. \n",

      " Telephone-driven community forums have been a widely proposed solution to address the unreliable internet connectivity and large geographic scope that characterizes many international NGO contexts. Primarily, these applications support asynchronous activities, such as information portals or forums to access rural journalism, but opportunities for real-time experience sharing remain largely under-explored. In this paper, we explore the potential of such forums to support remote mentoring of NGO volunteers, a practice that requires synchronous, dialogical formats for experience sharing and peer discussion. We engaged 28 participants from a rural Indian NGO in the design of peer-mentoring sessions that leverage synchronous audio discussions, using the structure and format of traditional talk-show radio as a starting point. The participants favored an entertaining approach to mentoring and discussed the logistics required to achieve this within their resource constraints. We conclude with design implications for designing media-driven community engagement platforms and the ethical challenges around protecting marginalized community interests.\n",

      " In this paper, we explore how the physically embodied nature of robots can influence learning through non-verbal communication, such as gesturing. We take an embodied cognition perspective to examine student interactions with a NAO robot that uses gestures while reasoning about geometry conjectures. College aged students (N = 30) were randomly assigned to either a dynamic condition, where the robot uses dynamic gestures that represent and manipulate geometric shapes in the conjectures, or control condition, where the robot uses beat gestures that match the rhythm of speech. Students in the dynamic condition: (1) use more gestures when they reason about geometry conjectures, (2) look more at the robot as it speaks, (3) feel the robot is a better study partner and uses effective gestures, but (4) were not more successful in correctly reasoning about geometry conjectures. We discuss implications for socially supported and embodied learning with a physically present robot.\n",

      " In recent years, political crowdfunding campaigns have emerged through which politicians raise money to fund their election campaigns. Divisive issues discussed in these campaigns may not only motivate donations but also could have a broader priming effect on people’s social opinions. In the U.S., more than one-third of the population with moderate opinions show a tendency to swing their opinion based on recent and more accessible events. In this paper, we ask: can such campaigns further prime people’s responses to partisan topics, even when we discuss those topics in a non-political context? To answer this question, we analyzed the influence of exposure to a political candidate’s crowdfunding campaign on responses to a subsequently seen, unrelated scientific topic that is not inherently political but is seen as partisan in the U.S. (climate change). We found that exposure to an attitude-inconsistent political candidate’s crowdfunding campaign (a campaign that is counter to someone’s existing political beliefs) can have a significant priming effect on subsequently seen politically charged topics. This effect may occur due to the activation of in-group identity by the candidate’s partisan campaign. Guided by these findings, we investigated elements that can mitigate this self-categorization effect. We found that carefully designed content following framing techniques such as schema framing and threat/safety framing can mitigate people’s sense of self-categorization toward non-political topics.\n",

      " Designing solution plans before writing code is critical for successful algorithmic problem-solving. Novices, however, often plan on-the-fly during implementation, resulting in unsuccessful problem-solving due to lack of mental organization of the solution. Research shows that subgoal learning helps learners develop more complete solution plans by enhancing their understanding of the high-level solution structure. However, expert-created materials such as subgoal labels are necessary to provide learning benefits from subgoal learning, which are a scarce resource in self-learning due to limited availability and high cost. We propose a learnersourcing workflow that collects high-quality subgoal labels from learners by helping them improve their label quality. We implemented the workflow into AlgoSolve, a prototype interface that supports subgoal learning for algorithmic problems. A between-subjects study with 63 problem-solving novices revealed that AlgoSolve helped learners create higher-quality labels and more complete solution plans, compared to a baseline method known to be effective in subgoal learning.\n",

      "Our eating practices are increasingly overshadowed by the presence of screen-based media technologies that conflict with the ideologies of mindful eating. However, little is known about whether and how screens influence our eating behaviors. To contribute to this understanding, we present a rich account of dining practices of ten participants with and without screen. Our study revealed that eating with screens was found more enjoyable than eating alone. Screens can influence one's awareness of hunger and other behaviors like chewing rate and food gaze, whereas screen-media did not trigger any judgements for food. Drawing on the study insights, we highlight the role of technology to support bodily awareness, savoring, a non-judgmental attitude to eating and on rethinking distractions as companions. The outlined considerations encourage a creative yet careful take on making mindful eating more accessible within the realities of screen-based dining cultures.\n",

      "It is challenging for customers to select appearance building products (e.g., skincare products, weight loss programs) that suit them personally as such products usually demonstrate efficacy only after long-term usage. Although e-retailers generally provide product descriptions or other customers’ reviews, users often find it hard to relate to their own situations. In this work, we proposed a pipeline to display envisioned users’ appearance after long-term use of appearance building products to deliver their efficacy on each individual visually. We selected skincare as a case and developed SkincareMirror which predicts skincare effects on users’ facial images by analyzing product function labels, efficacy ratings, and skin models’ images. The results of a between-subjects study (N=48) show that (1) SkincareMirror outperforms the baseline shopping site in terms of perceived usability, usefulness, user satisfaction and helps users select products faster; (2) SkincareMirror is especially effective to males and users with limited product domain knowledge. \n",

      " Understanding decision-making in dynamic and complex settings is a challenge yet essential for preventing, mitigating, and responding to adverse events (e.g., disasters, financial crises). Simulation games have shown promise to advance our understanding of decision-making in such settings. However, an open question remains on how we extract useful information from these games. We contribute an approach to model human-simulation interaction by leveraging existing methods to characterize: (1) system states of dynamic simulation environments (with Principal Component Analysis), (2) behavioral responses from human interaction with simulation (with Hidden Markov Models), and (3) behavioral responses across system states (with Sequence Analysis). We demonstrate this approach with our game simulating drug shortages in a supply chain context. Results from our experimental study with 135 participants show different player types (hoarders, reactors, followers), how behavior changes in different system states, and how sharing information impacts behavior. We discuss how our findings challenge existing literature.\n",

      "Gratitude, according to Oxford Language, is “the quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness.” One way to express gratitude is through community service, however, we found that high school and college students find it difficult to access service opportunities, especially when busy with school and other extracurricular activities. After completing eight in-depth interviews, we found students had difficulty in finding opportunities that sparked their interest, contacting organizations, as well as keeping track of their hours for organizations such as service clubs or college Greek life. To solve these problems for students, we created VolunteerSpot: an app that allows high school and college students to easily find service opportunities at the tip of their finger. VolunteerSpot utilizes an interface for volunteers, where they can filter through service opportunities by category, and an interface for organizations, who can post job opportunities. The app employs a messaging feature for communication between groups, a review widget, and can filter service opportunities by category and proximity to the user. We hope that by creating VolunteerSpot, students can use our app to give back to their community and express gratitude in an easy and interactive way.\n",

      "Augmented Reality (AR) experiences tightly associate virtual contents with environmental entities. However, the dissimilarity of different environments limits the adaptive AR content behaviors under large-scale deployment. We propose ScalAR, an integrated workflow enabling designers to author semantically adaptive AR experiences in Virtual Reality (VR). First, potential AR consumers collect local scenes with a semantic understanding technique. ScalAR then synthesizes numerous similar scenes. In VR, a designer authors the AR contents’ semantic associations and validates the design while being immersed in the provided scenes. We adopt a decision-tree-based algorithm to fit the designer’s demonstrations as a semantic adaptation model to deploy the authored AR experience in a physical scene. We further showcase two application scenarios authored by ScalAR and conduct a two-session user study where the quantitative results prove the accuracy of the AR content rendering and the qualitative results show the usability of ScalAR. \n",

      "Technological advancement has opened up opportunities for new sports and physical activities. We introduce a concept called machine-mediated teaming, in which a human and a surrogate machine form a team to participate in physical sports games. To understand the experience of machine-mediated teaming and the guidelines for designing the system to achieve the concept, we built a case study system based on tug-of-war. Our system is a sports game played by two against two. One team consists of a player who actually pulls the rope and another player who participates in the physical game by controlling the machine’s actuators. We conducted user studies using this system to investigate the sport experience in this form and to reveal insights to inform future research on machine-mediated teaming. Based on the data obtained from the user studies, we clarified three perspectives, machine stamina, action space, and explicit feedback, that should be considered when designing future machine-mediated teaming systems. The research presented in this paper offers a first step towards exploring how humans and machines can coexist in highly dynamic physical interactions. \n",

      "We investigate performance characteristics when switching between four pointing methods: absolute touch, absolute pen, relative mouse, and relative trackpad. The established “subtraction method” protocol used in mode-switching studies is extended to test pairs of methods and accommodate switch direction, multiple baselines, and controlling relative cursor position. A first experiment examines method switching on and around the horizontal surface of a tablet. Results find switching between pen and touch is fastest, and switching between relative and absolute methods incurs additional time penalty. A second experiment expands the investigation to an emerging foldable all-screen laptop form factor where switching also occurs on an angled surface and along a smoothly curved hinge. Results find switching between trackpad and touch is fastest, with all switching times generally higher. Our work contributes missing empirical evidence for switching performance using modern input methods, and our results can inform interaction design for current and emerging device form factors. \n",

      " We found significant gaps in the climates and built environments used as settings for studies of HCI outdoors. The experience of using a computer outdoors varies widely depending on location-specific factors such as weather and the availability of electricity. We surveyed 699 papers from CHI venues and found 101 studies involving a person and a computer interacting outdoors for which we could determine the study location. We categorized each study location by climate using the Köppen-Geiger scheme and by built environment using the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum. 91 of 101 studies took place in temperate or continental climates and 82 took place in urban settings. Emerging understanding of the ongoing impacts of climate change increases the importance of investigating HCI outdoors in a wider range of weather conditions. While some primitive natural settings have been preserved against development at great cost, we found no studies of HCI outdoors in those settings.\n",

      "We often take things for granted. One such thing is food. A lot of effort goes on in bringing the plate of food to our tables, and we recognize that effort when we cook for ourselves, but often we neglect that when we eat at restaurants. Invisible Workers (People working behind the scenes) ranging from farmers, people from production, distribution, storing, stocking, and many more to the chefs that cook our food are some of the people that have put a lot of effort into the food on our plates. The goal of this paper is to acknowledge and make the effort of invisible workers visible by raising awareness and offering a means to express gratitude. As a specific case, we decided to focus on workers at Indiana University Diners that represent a part of a huge population of invisible workers. Our design uses a Kiosk based system that will allow students who eat at Indiana university diner to share gratitude that will reach the invisible workers via diverse ways such as email, audio, etc.\n",

To understand how street outreach workers (SOWs) use information and communication technologies (ICTs) and how they envision future ICTs that better support their work, we interviewed 25 SOWs across three organizations. Results suggest that SOWs leverage ICTs to: 1) identify and mediate conflict; 2) support collaboration and teamwork; and 3) invoke community connections and trust. SOWs posit that new ICTs could provide a seamless infrastructure for communication among SOWs and between community members, assist with training to sharpen conflict negotiation skills, and provide insight on effective conflict mediation strategies.\n",

      " Walking impairment is a debilitating symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disease affecting 2.8 million people worldwide. While clinicians’ in-person observational gait assessments are important, research suggests that data from wearable sensors can indicate early onset of gait impairment, track patients’ responses to treatment, and support remote and longitudinal assessment. We present an inquiry into supporting the transition from research to clinical practice. Co-design by HCI, biomedical, neurology and rehabilitation researchers resulted in a data-rich interface prototype for augmented gait analysis based on visualized sensor data. We used this as a prompt in interviews with ten experienced clinicians from a range of MS rehabilitation roles. We find that clinicians value quantitative sensor data within a whole patient narrative, to help track specific rehabilitation goals, but identify a tension between grasping critical information quickly and more detailed understanding. Based on the findings we make design recommendations for data-rich remote rehabilitation interfaces.\n",

      "Guided by the 12 principles of animation, stylization is a core 2D animation feature but has been utilized mainly by experienced animators. Although there are tools for stylizing 2D animations, creating stylized 3D animations remains a challenging problem due to the additional spatial dimension and the need for responsive actions like contact and collision. We propose a system that helps users create stylized casual 3D animations. A layered authoring interface is employed to balance between ease of use and expressiveness. Our surface level UI is a timeline sequencer that lets users add preset stylization effects such as squash and stretch and follow through to plain motions. Users can adjust spatial and temporal parameters to fine-tune these stylizations. These edits are propagated to our node-graph-based second level UI, in which the users can create custom stylizations after they are comfortable with the surface level UI. Our system also enables the stylization of interactions among multiple objects like force, energy, and collision. A pilot user study has shown that our fluid layered UI design allows for both ease of use and expressiveness better than existing tools. \n",

To support designers who aim to engage in a participatory design process in EMS environments, we created and evaluated the Contextual Secondary Video Toolkit (CSVT). This method uses secondary video material and design cards that allow domain experts to identify and prioritise challenges in their work environment and generate design ideas that address them. We illustrate the effects of the CSVT on design processes by analysing four workshops during which aeromedical EMS staff explored the potential of augmented reality to support their work. Our results indicate that the CSVT can support reflection about work practices, aid the generation of design ideas, and facilitate genuine participation. Furthermore, our data indicates that the use of secondary video in design projects is appropriate and even has certain advantages compared to primary field video.\n",

      "The diminutive size of wrist wearables has prompted the design of many novel input techniques to increase expressivity. Finger identification, or assigning different functionality to different fingers, has been frequently proposed. However, while the value of the technique seems clear, its implementation remains challenging, often relying on external devices (e.g., worn magnets) or explicit instructions. Addressing these limitations, this paper explores a novel approach to natural and unencumbered finger identification on an unmodified smartwatch: sonar. To do this, we adapt an existing finger tracking smartphone sonar implementation—rather than extract finger motion, we process raw sonar fingerprints representing the complete sonar scene recorded during a touch. We capture data from 16 participants operating a smartwatch and use their sonar fingerprints to train a deep learning recognizer that identifies taps by the thumb, index, and middle fingers with an accuracy of up to 93.7%, sufficient to support meaningful application development. \n",

To better support urban accessibility assessment using data visualizations, we conducted a three-part interview study with 25 participants across five stakeholder groups using map visualization probes. We present a multi-stakeholder analysis of visualization needs and sensemaking processes to explore how interactive visualizations can support stakeholder decision making. In particular, we elaborate how stakeholders’ varying levels of familiarity with accessibility, geospatial analysis, and specific geographic locations influences their sensemaking needs. We then contribute 10 design considerations for geovisual analytic tools for urban accessibility communication, planning, policymaking, and advocacy.\n",

      "Research reveals that managing mobile device use during family time can be a source of stress for parents. In particular, it can create conflict in their relationships. As such, there is a need to understand how these problematic experiences might be addressed by new approaches to technology design. This paper presents a study in which 14 parents were prompted to reflect on how their experiences and relationships could be improved by four design proposals. These proposals resulted from ideation workshops involving 12 professional designers, and were presented as scenario-based storyboards during interviews. Our interviews revealed three design approaches that appealed to parents. We describe seven benefits that parents imagined these approaches would have, and discuss ways in which they should be further explored. Thus, we contribute to a more complete understanding of how technology design might better support parents’ aspirations for how devices are used within the family.\n",

      "Traditionally, game designers have driven the development process of psychotherapeutic games with psychotherapists playing a consultant role. In contrast, our study explores psychotherapists independently designing digitally gamified psychotherapy. Our workshop participants consisted of six psychotherapists who created gamified digital therapies with the design prompt of anxiety disorder. We analyze the resulting six prototypes from a game design and psychotherapy perspective. We present insights into strategies for digitally gamifying therapy and identify challenges and opportunities for the future of gamified psychotherapy, grounded in the experiences of psychotherapists designing such therapies. This study also reflects on the use of user-friendly development tools for independently curating gamified digital therapies, especially by non-technical users such as psychotherapists. \n",

      "With about 230 million packages delivered per day in 2020, fetching packages has become a routine for many city dwellers in China. When fetching packages, people usually need to go to collection sites of their apartment complexes or a KuaiDiGui, an increasingly popular type of self-service package pickup machine. However, little is known whether such processes are accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) city dwellers. We interviewed BLV people (N=20) living in a large metropolitan area in China to understand their practices and challenges of fetching packages. Our findings show that participants encountered difficulties in finding the collection site and localizing and recognizing their packages. When fetching packages from KuaiDiGuis, they had difficulty in identifying the correct KuaiDiGui, interacting with its touch screen, navigating the complex on-screen workflow, and opening the target compartment. We discuss design considerations to make the package fetching process more accessible to the BLV community. \n",

      " The disadvantaged population is often underserved and marginalized in technology engagement: prior works show they are generally more reluctant and experience more barriers in adopting and engaging with mainstream technology. Here, we contribute to the HCI4D and ICTD literature through a novel “counter” case study on Chinese social commerce (e.g., Pinduoduo), which 1) first prospers among the traditionally underserved community from developing regions ahead of the more technologically advantaged communities, and 2) has been heavily engaged by this community. Through 12 in-depth interviews with social commerce users from the traditionally underserved community in Chinese developing regions, we demonstrate how social commerce, acting as a “virtual bazaar”, brings online the traditional offline socioeconomic lives the community has lived for ages, fits into the community’s social, cultural, and economic context, and thus effectively promotes technology inclusivity. Our work provides novel insights and implications for building inclusive technology for the “next billion” population. \n",

      "Touchless input could transform clinical activity by allowing health professionals direct control over medical imaging systems in a sterile manner. Currently, users face the issues of being unable to directly manipulate imaging in aseptic environments, as well as needing to touch shared surfaces in other hospital areas. Unintended input is a key challenge for touchless interaction and could be especially disruptive in medical contexts. We evaluated four clutching techniques with 34 health professionals, measuring interaction performance and interviewing them to obtain insight into their views on clutching, and touchless control of medical imaging. As well as exploring the performance of the different clutching techniques, our analysis revealed an appetite for reliable touchless interfaces, a strong desire to reduce shared surface contact, and suggested potential improvements such as combined authentication and touchless control. Our findings can inform the development of novel touchless medical systems and identify challenges for future research. \n",

      "Forgetfulness is a primary factor of medication nonadherence, a problem that contributes to worse health outcomes and increased mortality among people with chronic conditions. Common strategies to address forgetfulness, such as timed reminders, have limited effectiveness. However, there is limited information about why these strategies fail. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with people who take medications daily and miss doses at least twice a month. We contribute a state-based Medication Routine Framework composed of four states (Wellness, New Task, Erratic, and Disruption) in two axes (regularity and time scale). Because most nonadherence due to forgetfulness occurs in nonroutine states (i.e., Erratic and Disruption state), we argue that improving technology for medication adherence requires designing for these states. In this paper, we describe each state in detail and discuss opportunities for adapting medication reminder strategies to overcome the challenges of nonroutine states. \n",

      " Emotion-related parent-child interactions during early childhood play a crucial role in the development of emotion regulation, a fundamental life skill central to well-being. However, limited work in HCI has explored how technology could support parents in adopting supportive emotion socialisation practices. In this paper, we explore how an embodied, in-situ intervention in the form of a smart toy can impact emotion-related parent-child interactions in the home. We draw on (1) interviews with 29 parents of young children who had the smart toy for at least 1 month; (2) co-design workshops with 12 parents and 8 parenting course facilitators. We discuss how the smart toy impacted parent-child interactions around emotions for a subset of families, and draw on workshop data to explore how this could be designed for directly. Finally, we propose a set of design directions for technology-enabled systems aiming to elicit and scaffold specific parent-child interactions over time.\n",

      " Although there is a potential demand for customizing voices, most customization is limited to the visual appearance of a figure (e.g., avatars). To better understand the users’ need, we first conducted an online survey with 104 participants. Then we conducted a semi-structured interview with a prototype with 14 participants to identify design considerations for supporting voice customization. The results show that there is a desire for voice customization especially for non-face-to-face conversations with someone unfamiliar. In addition, the findings revealed that different voices are favored for different contexts from a better version of one’s own voice for improving delivery to a completely different voice for securing identity. As future work, we plan to extend this study by investigating voice synthesis techniques for end-users who wish to design their own voices for various contexts. \n",

Our work, conducted in the hottest city in the USA, focuses on solar cooking as a set of creative DIY activities that use extreme heat and mitigate human impact on the environment. We report on a summer-long study whereby 7 enthusiasts built solar ovens from scratch and experimented with solar recipes ranging from slow-cooked pork and chicken to bread, kale chips, brownies, jerky, and fruit rollups. Our findings depict solar cooking as a form of iterative DIY, which, through its challenges and creative workarounds, serves as a point of engagement with both food and extreme heat. We reflect on solar cooking as a climate-resilient food practice and conclude with design considerations for HCI to support solar cooking as a habitual community practice.\n",

      " Designing responsive visualizations can be cast as applying transformations to a source view to render it suitable for a different screen size. However, designing responsive visualizations is often tedious as authors must manually apply and reason about candidate transformations. We present Cicero, a declarative grammar for concisely specifying responsive visualization transformations which paves the way for more intelligent responsive visualization authoring tools. Cicero’s flexible specifier syntax allows authors to select visualization elements to transform, independent of the source view’s structure. Cicero encodes a concise set of actions to encode a diverse set of transformations in both desktop-first and mobile-first design processes. Authors can ultimately reuse design-agnostic transformations across different visualizations. To demonstrate the utility of Cicero, we develop a compiler to an extended version of Vega-Lite, and provide principles for our compiler. We further discuss the incorporation of Cicero into responsive visualization authoring tools, such as a design recommender.\n",

      " Automated decision systems (ADS) are increasingly used for consequential decision-making. These systems often rely on sophisticated yet opaque machine learning models, which do not allow for understanding how a given decision was arrived at. This is not only problematic from a legal perspective, but non-transparent systems are also prone to yield unfair outcomes because their sanity is challenging to assess and calibrate in the first place—which is particularly worrisome for human decision-subjects. Based on this observation and building upon existing work, I aim to make the following three main contributions through my doctoral thesis: (a) understand how (potential) decision-subjects perceive algorithmic decisions (with varying degrees of transparency of the underlying ADS), as compared to similar decisions made by humans; (b) evaluate different tools for transparent decision-making with respect to their effectiveness in enabling people to appropriately assess the quality and fairness of ADS; and (c) develop human-understandable technical artifacts for fair automated decision-making. Over the course of the first half of my PhD program, I have already addressed substantial pieces of (a) and (c), whereas (b) will be the major focus of the second half. \n",

      " Typing on mobile devices is a common and complex task. The act of typing itself thereby encodes rich information, such as the typing method, the context it is performed in, and individual traits of the person typing. Researchers are increasingly using a selection or combination of experience sampling and passive sensing methods in real-world settings to examine typing behaviours. However, there is limited understanding of the effects these methods have on measures of input speed, typing behaviours, compliance, perceived trust and privacy. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs of everyday data collection methods. We contribute empirical results from a four-week field study (N=26). Here, participants contributed by transcribing, composing, passively having sentences analyzed and reflecting on their contributions. We present a tradeoff analysis of these data collection methods, discuss their impact on text-entry applications, and contribute a flexible research platform for in the wild text-entry studies.\n",

      " Previous qualitative work has documented that platform workers place an immense importance on their reputation due to the use of algorithmic management by online labor platforms. We provide a general experimental method, which can be used across platforms and time, for numerically quantifying the intensity with which platform workers experience reputation system-based algorithmic management. Our method works via an experiment where workers choose between a monetary bonus or a positive review. We demonstrate this method by measuring the value that freelancers assigned to positive feedback on Upwork in June 2020. The median freelancer in our sample valued a single positive review at ∼ $49 USD. We also find that less experienced freelancers valued a positive review more highly than those with more experience. Qualitative data collected during the experiment indicates that many freelancers considered issues related to reputation system-based algorithmic management while choosing between the monetary reward and the positive review.\n",

      "Previous gesture elicitation studies have found that user proposals are influenced by legacy bias which may inhibit users from proposing gestures that are most appropriate for an interaction. Increasing production during elicitation studies has shown promise moving users beyond legacy gestures. However, variety decreases as more symbols are produced. While several studies have used increased production since its introduction, little research has focused on understanding the effect on the proposed gesture quality, on why variety decreases, and on whether increased production should be limited. In this paper, we present a gesture elicitation study aimed at understanding the impact of increased production. We show that users refine the most promising gestures and that how long it takes to find promising gestures varies by participant. We also show that gestural refinements provide insight into the gestural features that matter for users to assign semantic meaning and discuss implications for training gesture classifiers.\n",

We present a mixed-methods study exploring how the presence of music and sound effects impacts the player experience of a board game. We found that the soundtrack increased the enjoyment and tension experienced by players during game play. We also found that a soundtrack provided atmosphere surrounding the gaming experience, though players did not necessarily experience this as enhancing the world-building capabilities of the game. We discuss how our findings can inform the design of new games and soundtracks as well as future research into board game player experience.\n",

      " By sensing how a user is holding a smartphone, adaptive user interfaces are possible such as those that automatically switch the displayed content and position of graphical user interface (GUI) components following how the phone is being held. We propose ReflecTouch, a novel method for detecting how a smartphone is being held by capturing images of the smartphone screen reflected on the cornea with a built-in front camera. In these images, the areas where the user places their fingers on the screen appear as shadows, which makes it possible to estimate the grasp posture. Since most smartphones have a front camera, this method can be used regardless of the device model; in addition, no additional sensor or hardware is required. We conducted data collection experiments to verify the classification accuracy of the proposed method for six different grasp postures, and the accuracy was 85%.\n",

In this paper, we draw on two SHCI corpora to ask: Has SHCI progressed? How has the field responded to prominent critiques? Have we identified and adopted constructive strategies for impacting environmental unsustainability? We further show the wide array of competencies SHCI researchers have been called to develop, and how this has been reflected in subsequent work. Our analysis identifies significant shifts in the SHCI landscape, toward research that is diverse and holistic, but also away from efforts to address the urgent climate crisis. We posit that SHCI has tended to take on far more than it could reasonably expect to deliver, and propose ‘Green Policy informatics’ as a pathway that enables SHCI to leverage a more traditional HCI skillset in addressing climate change.\n",

Drawing from literature in the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), gender and development studies, and health informatics, I will critically examine health workers’ experiences and relationships with “intelligent” systems, and engage in the participatory design of technology that might better serve worker needs while strengthening the frontline health ecology overall.\n",

Our approach characterizes user-specific cursor control abilities from a multidirectional point-select task to configure letters on a virtual keyboard based on estimated time, distance, and direction of movement. These methods were evaluated in three individuals with motor disabilities against a generically optimized keyboard and the ubiquitous QWERTY keyboard. We highlight key observations relating to the heterogeneity of the manifestation of motor disabilities, perceived importance of communication technology, and quantitative improvements in communication performance when characterizing an individual's movement abilities to design personalized AAC interfaces.\n",

How do users react to social media outage? Do they become anxious? Or, do they enjoy these brief episodes of social media detox? To answer these questions, we conducted a topic modeling analysis of 223,815 tweets that used the hashtag #facebookdown during the major Facebook outage on 10/4/2021. We uncovered 10 major themes of users’ reactions towards social media outage. Results showed that most users complained, mocked and showed desperation about the outage situation, and during the outage period, increased their quest for other social-media alternatives. Also, surprisingly, many users celebrated the detox from Facebook rather than wishing it to come back as soon as possible. Results offer design implications for practitioners who would like to better respond to future outages.\n",

Progress in sign-language recognition may enable devices to respond to sign-language commands and potentially mitigate these barriers, but research is needed to understand how DHH users would interact with these devices and what commands they would issue. In this work, we directly engage with the DHH community, using a Wizard-of-Oz prototype that appears to understand American Sign Language (ASL) commands. Our analysis of video recordings of DHH participants revealed how they woke-up the device to initiate commands, structured commands in ASL, and responded to device errors, providing guidance to future designers and researchers. We share our dataset of over 1400 commands, which may be of interest to sign-language-recognition researchers.\n",

To better understand the complex relationships between motivations, we chose Grounded Theory as the most pertinent approach and interviewed 14 singles with full autonomy over their food choices. We further leveraged the availability of large online food-related datasets to inform and reinforce our findings from the qualitative work. We analyzed 6687 user behaviors of Food.com, a popular recipe recommendation site, according to the 18 influencers of food choice identified from the qualitative interviews. We found three meaningful clusters of user behavior: Minimalists, Social Butterflies and Conscious eaters. The interview data, thus, enabled grounded classification of the large scale user behavior and provided a grounded way to interpret the relationship among the top motivators identified in each clusters. The cluster analysis will inform future sampling of interviewees and will provide new insightful questions for the qualitative research. The case study delineates a dynamic interplay of qualitative and quantitative data used to investigate human food choice, a novel domain in the Human-Food Interaction literature. \n",

      " Self-tracking technologies, especially those facilitating support from social systems, are becoming more common for treating serious mental illnesses in both clinical and informal contexts. A recently proposed feature is co-tracking, where data is gathered not only from the perspective of the user managing their condition, but also from their close contacts. The proposed system therefore supports multiple perspectives (data streams) about the same variable of interest (i.e., an individual’s mood). However, the subjective and reciprocal nature of mental health data gives rise to challenges in visualizing uncertainty that must be addressed before clinical use. Here, we create an application-specific typology of uncertainty for visualizing multi-source mental health data, and propose design solutions to communicate this uncertainty. Via a case study of mood tracking with bipolar disorder, we present an interactive visualization prototype for understanding dynamic mood states in close relationships, moving toward a real-world implementation of a co-tracking informatics system.\n",

However, the impacts of these visual contents on human cognitive processes, particularly related to flavor perception and its attributes, are still not thoroughly explored. This paper presents a user study to evaluate the influence of six different types of video content (including nature, cooking, and a new food video genre known as mukbang) on people’s flavor perceptions in terms of taste sensations, liking, and emotions while eating plain white rice. Our findings revealed that the participants’ flavor perceptions are augmented based on different video content, indicating significant differences in their perceived taste sensations (e.g., increased perception of salty and spicy sensations). Furthermore, potential future implications are revealed to promote digital commensality and healthier eating habits. \n",

      "As demonstrated by users’ resistance to ads on Google Home in 2017, persuasive communications from voice assistants (VAs) can be seen as inappropriate. But, they may be better received if the VAs are not the sources but mere media for ads, as happens with radio. User motives may play a role as well, with those who use VAs primarily for information resenting ads more than those who see their VAs as social companions. To test such propositions, we conducted a scenario-based user study (N = 264) in which Siri acted as either a source of ads or as a medium for delivering ads by a human spokesperson. Findings suggest that for informationally motivated users, Siri as ad source causes reactance via lowered sense of control over the interaction. On the other hand, for those with social motives, it increases social presence and positively affects user experience of the interaction.\n",

      "Video meetings are notorious for difficulties with conversational turn-taking, which has impacts on inclusion and outcomes. We present a scalable automatic process to categorize turn-taking patterns in remote meetings based on eyes-off analysis of meeting transcripts. Drawing on a series of remote meetings (10 series, 34 total meetings) recorded in July-August 2021 by employees of a global technology company, we identified and parametrized patterns of cooperative and competitive overlaps of turns. The results show initial success characterizing people's behaviours as either likely to continue or cede turns based on either the amount of overlap that they produce during other's turns or the amount of overlap they experience in their own turns. With further development and validation, this method could be used to measure inclusion in remote and hybrid meetings.\n",

We use frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensors to classify different objects embedded with low-cost radar reflectors of varying sizes on a tabletop setup. We also introduce Stackable IDs, where different objects can be stacked and combined to produce unique IDs. The result allows RaITIn to accurately identify visually identical objects embedded with different low-cost reflector configurations. When combined with a radar’s ability for tracking, it creates novel tabletop interaction modalities. We discuss possible applications and areas for future work.\n",

      " Gesture elicitation studies are commonly used for designing novel gesture-based interfaces. There is a rich methodology literature on metrics and analysis methods that helps researchers understand and characterize data arising from such studies. However, deriving concrete gesture vocabularies from this data, which is often the ultimate goal, remains largely based on heuristics and ad hoc methods. In this paper, we treat the problem of deriving a gesture vocabulary from gesture elicitation data as a computational optimization problem. We show how to formalize it as an optimal assignment problem and discuss how to express objective functions and custom design constraints through integer programs. In addition, we introduce a set of tools for assessing the uncertainty of optimization outcomes due to random sampling, and for supporting researchers’ decisions on when to stop collecting data from a gesture elicitation study. We evaluate our methods on a large number of simulated studies.\n",

      " Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) supporting the synergistic use of natural modalities like speech and gesture have been conceived as promising for spatial or 3D interactions, e.g., in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (XR for short). Yet, the currently prevailing user interfaces are unimodal. Commercially available software platforms like the Unity or Unreal game engines simplify the complexity of developing XR applications through appropriate tool support. They provide ready-to-use device integration, e.g., for 3D controllers or motion tracking, and according interaction techniques such as menus, (3D) point-and-click, or even simple symbolic gestures to rapidly develop unimodal interfaces. A comparable tool support is yet missing for multimodal solutions in this and similar areas. We believe that this hinders user-centered research based on rapid prototyping of MMIs, the identification and formulation of practical design guidelines, the development of killer applications highlighting the power of MMIs, and ultimately a widespread adoption of MMIs. This article investigates potential reasons for the ongoing uncommonness of MMIs. Our case study illustrates and analyzes lessons learned during the development and application of a toolchain that supports rapid development of natural and synergistic MMIs for XR use-cases. We analyze the toolchain in terms of developer usability, development time, and MMI customization. This analysis is based on the knowledge gained in years of research and academic education. Specifically, it reflects on the development of appropriate MMI tools and their application in various demo use-cases, in user-centered research, and in the lab work of a mandatory MMI course of an HCI master’s program. The derived insights highlight successful choices made as well as potential areas for improvement.\n",

      "The philosophical construct readiness-to-hand describes focused, intuitive, tool use, and has been linked to tool-embodiment and immersion. The construct has been influential in HCI and design for decades, but researchers currently lack appropriate measures and tools to investigate it empirically. To support such empirical work we investigate the possibility of operationalising readiness-to-hand in measurements of multfractality in movement, building on recent work in cognitive science. We conduct two experiments (N=44, N=30) investigating multifractality in mouse movements during a computer game, replicating prior results and contributing new findings. Our results show that multifractality correlates with dimensions associated with readiness-to-hand, including skill and task-engagement, during tool breakdown, task learning and normal play. We describe future possibilities for the application of these methods in HCI, supporting such work by sharing scripts and data (https://osf.io/2hm9u/), and introducing a new data-driven approach to parameter selection. \n",

      "The paper aims to highlight the way how competencies are changing, following technological progress and new tasks for sustainable development. New social challenges demand a new generation of competencies to apply technologies to produce positive effects on the wellbeing of society. There are known approaches to describing the competencies based on the assumption that they are applicable to any industry, but they are not. We suggest considering the quantity and quality of competencies in the context of industry, identifying the special abilities for its improvement with help of digital technologies. The industrial transformation promotes sustainability if it is based on a deep understanding of technology and industry. The result of this research is the designed concept of competencies for digital transformation based on a variety of industries. This is a preliminary step for advancing the existing concepts of digital competencies to transform the industry to support sustainable development.\n",

      " The last several years have seen a strong growth of telerobotic technologies with promising implications for many areas of learning. HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on user experiences and user interfaces of telepresence robots. However, only a few telerobot studies have addressed everyday use in real-world learning environments. In the post-COVID 19 world, sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen challenges to learning in hybrid learning environments constitute a unique frontier where robotic and immersive technologies can mediate learning experiences. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods for use of immersive and telerobotic technologies in real-world learning environments. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on robot-mediated learning in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts regarding telerobots for learning.\n",

      " Games have become a popular way of collecting human subject data, based on the premise that they are more engaging than surveys or experiments, but generate equally valid data. However, this premise has not been empirically tested. In response, we designed a game for eliciting linguistic data following Intrinsic Elicitation – a design approach aiming to minimise validity threats in data collection games – and compared it to an equivalent linguistics experiment as control. In a preregistered study and replication (n=96 and n=136), using two different ways of operationalising accuracy, the game generated substantially more enjoyment (d=.70,.73) and substantially less accurate data (d=-.68, -.40) – though still more accurate than random responding. We conclude that for certain data types data collection games may present a serious trade-off between participant enjoyment and data quality, identify possible causes of lower data quality for future research, reflect on our design approach, and urge games HCI researchers to use careful controls where appropriate.\n",

      " The elderly population worldwide got immensely affected by the increased isolation and risk for complications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, elderly women get more affected by social isolation and distress irrespective of health factors. We aim to understand how urban elderly women in Southeast Asia – typically highly dependent on the other family members due to cultural practices – took care of their mental health with uncertainty and distress using technology during the social distance period. Through 19 semi-structured interviews with participants from six Southeast Asian countries and analyzing the data using thematic analysis, we surfaced that our participants started learning different technology with great enthusiasm and used them for their mental well-being during the pandemic period. This paper portrays how our participants enhanced interpersonal bonding, cultivated self-care and creative outlets, and facilitated positivism around their social circle using different technology platforms to mitigate their stress and uncertainty during the pandemic. Our participants’ technology usage for better mental well-being during the COVID-19 period provides HCI researchers with valuable design guidelines. Here, we contribute by expanding the HCI community’s understanding of technology design within the intersection of the elderly population and mental health for the Southeast Asian cultural context.\n",

      " The LilyTiny sewable microcontroller was created ten years ago, in an effort to make electronic textiles more accessible. At the time, e-textiles was gaining traction as a means to invite more diverse participation in computing, but financial and instructional barriers stood in the way of broader adoption. In addition, there existed a scaffolding gap between projects involving lights, batteries, and thread – and those requiring programming (i.e. leveraging the LilyPad Arduino and/or additional sensors or outputs). In an effort to expand access to electronic textiles, we designed the LilyTiny, an inexpensive, pre-programmed sewable microcontroller which controls assorted LED patterns, and which later became available for purchase through SparkFun. Alongside the LilyTiny, we released a free workshop guide for educators which details five low-cost activities that can be taught without any prior electronics experience.  This paper summarizes our development of the LilyTiny and companion curriculum – and reflects on whether we met our stated goal of expanding access to electronic textiles in the decade since. We share and discuss some measures of impact, including a survey of derivative products and a multi-year analysis of sales data from the LilyTiny’s sole distributor SparkFun Electronics.\n",

      " Touchscreen tracking latency, often 80ms or more, creates a rubber-banding effect in everyday direct manipulation tasks such as dragging, scrolling, and drawing. This has been shown to decrease system preference, user performance, and overall realism of these interfaces. In this research, we demonstrate how the addition of a thin, 2D micro-patterned surface with 5 micron spaced features can be used to reduce motor-visual touchscreen latency. When a finger, stylus, or tangible is translated across this textured surface frictional forces induce acoustic vibrations which naturally encode sliding velocity. This acoustic signal is sampled at 192kHz using a conventional audio interface pipeline with an average latency of 28ms. When fused with conventional low-speed, but high-spatial-accuracy 2D touch position data, our machine learning model can make accurate predictions of real time touch location.\n",

In this panel, we will discuss the pros and cons of both approaches, discuss which one may prevail in the future, and what opportunities exist for closer collaboration between researchers from the two research fields. \n",

      "Runners want to actively explore unknown environments without the fear of getting lost. We conducted a survey to better understand runners’ needs and practices in this context. The survey results emphasized the interest in flexible exploration. To address this interest, we designed FlexNav, a system that supports exploratory running through flexible tours that link the best runnable zones in a neighbourhood. FlexNav provides adaptive navigation support enabling runners to follow such tours without continually getting disruptive directions. We tested it with runners to assess its usability. The results confirm the usefulness of the system and the users' preference for flexible tours over fully specified tours with turn-by-turn guidance. Our study highlights the subjective nature of runnable zones and the subtle balance between guidance and exploration.\n",

      "In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise as a means of delivering rehabilitative care to restore arm function in stroke patients. At the same time, limitations of traditional clinical scales for measuring arm function recovery have led to the more widespread use of kinematic metrics. These metrics quantify useful properties of patients’ movements using motion tracking data captured while the patient performs different types of assessment tasks. Given modern consumer VR systems already collect the data needed to calculate many common kinematic metrics, these systems could eventually be used to both deliver stroke rehabilitation programs and administer kinematic assessments to monitor patients’ recovery. However, it is not yet clear how the properties of VR-based assessment tasks may systematically impact the values of kinematic metrics used to assess arm function post-stroke. To begin addressing this question, we examined the influence of two task properties (movement direction and hand dominance) on a set of 10 kinematic metrics during a discrete reaching task performed by healthy participants using an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. Our findings indicate that all 10 metrics were significantly impacted by these task properties, confirming that kinematic metrics captured in this context are sensitive to task properties. Our results also provide an initial account of how the metrics were influenced by each task property and highlight needs for future work to further understand the influence of assessment task properties on VR-based kinematic assessments.\n",

      " In this paper, we explore how computing device use by people with upper extremity impairment (UEI) was affected by COVID-19. Someone with UEI has reduced use of their shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, and/or fingers. We conducted six (6) semi-structured interviews with participants with UEI in the US. We found that people with UEI increased computing device use during COVID-19 not only for remote interactions but also in person. Additionally, social distancing for COVID-19 safety created the need for new assistive technology (AT), authentication requirements, and communication platforms, which introduced their own accessibility barriers. We also found that personal protective equipment (PPE) created new barriers during computing device use, which often caused people with UEI to choose COVID-19 safety over the usability of their computing devices. Based on these findings, we describe future opportunities to make computing devices more accessible for people with UEI to manage the shifts in computing device use introduced by COVID-19.\n",

SipBit consists of an electrical impedance measurement unit and a recognition method based on deep learning techniques. First, impedance measurements of a beverage are acquired using Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy. Then, a multi-task network cascade algorithm was employed to identify eight different beverage types in various volume levels and sugar concentrations. Results show that the multi-task network cascade discriminates beverage types with an accuracy of 96.32%, and estimates volumes with a root mean square error of 13.74ml and sugar content with a root mean square error of 7.99gdm− 3. Future work will include: 1) developing utensils embedded with SipBit for automatic beverage and attribute recognition, and 2) further developing SipBit to recognize additional beverage types and their attributes, thus enabling a new avenue for designing human-food interactive technologies.\n",

      "Promoting healthy and active lifestyles is an important objective for many governing agencies. The design of active urban environments can be an effective tool to encourage more active behaviors and water features can attract people, improving their experience of the urban space. To explore the potential of these concepts, we designed Fontana; an interactive public installation that aims to stimulate physical activity and social connectedness in the urban outdoor space, using the multidimensional attractiveness of water. We focus on the use of embedded interactive technology to promote physical activity, using water as a linking element between users. Adopting a research-through-design approach, we explored how such installations can nudge people into an active behavior while additionally strengthening social connectedness, using inclusive design principles. We report on insights gathered through this case study and findings of a preliminary user test, discussing the implications of this work for design researchers and practitioners.\n",

      " COVID-19 has been known to have a disproportionate impact on African Americans in the United States. Although studies have been conducted on the reasons for this disparity, there has been less focus on how the African American population sought trustworthy health information using technology. This is important because African Americans’ mistrust of the medical system has been suggested as a possible reason for the disproportionate impact. Therefore, we conducted interviews with 18 African Americans with chronic conditions to discover what types of challenges they faced while searching for trustworthy information on COVID-19 and the strategies they used to overcome these challenges. We found that participants actively evaluated the credibility of different information sources, searched for first-hand information from people they could relate to, and tried to avoid or reduce media consumption to prevent information overload.\n",

      " The uptake of open science resources needs knowledge construction on the side of the readers/receivers of scientific content. The design of technologies surrounding open science resources can facilitate such knowledge construction, but this has not been investigated yet. To do so, we first conducted a scoping review of literature, from which we draw design heuristics for knowledge construction in digital environments. Subsequently, we grouped the underlying technological functionalities into three design categories: i) structuring and supporting collaboration, ii) supporting the learning process, and iii) structuring, visualising and navigating (learning) content. Finally, we mapped the design categories and associated design heuristics to core components of popular open science platforms. This mapping constitutes a design space (design implications), which informs researchers and designers in the HCI community about suitable functionalities for supporting knowledge construction in existing or new digital open science platforms. \n",

      " Care work is often moralized as essential to the functioning of society, but has long been undervalued economically and politically, contributing to a global care crisis and prompting increased control and extraction of care work to stabilize capitalist systems. The role of emerging technologies in these politics of care is understudied, particularly in the Global South. My research looks at why and how emerging technologies are being introduced into care work in health in India and Kenya, uncovering the implications this has for how care work is done, care workers’ lives, and organizations deploying the technology. Drawing on cases of both harm and opportunity effected by technology, my work offers an empirical understanding of the role of technology in the politics of care work, and the implications this can have for the future of care work amidst a global care crisis. \n",

      " Linguistic skills are the building blocks of one of the most resourceful abilities of human beings: communication. Compromised linguistic skills significantly reduce the understanding or exchanging of meaningful messages and information. Children with difficulties in this area are often enrolled in extensive speech therapy programs and, nowadays, such issues affect also bilingual children with a migrant background, impacting their quality of life. Our research explores a Tangible User Interface developed on a new paradigm we postulated called ”Embodied Argument Movement”. In this paper, we present Moovy, an engaging table-top game for rehabilitating challenging morphosyntactic constructs and improving language skills. We performed two pilot studies with 13 children; one to test the User Experience and the other to assess Moovy’s efficacy and the paradigm soundness. Preliminary results suggest that Moovy could make a difference in speech-therapies programs, fostering children to continue their therapy willingly and successfully. \n",

      " Entertainment is enjoyable and helps people to feel socially connected with others. However, the control of entertainment applications in group situations is often restricted to one person. This especially limits group decision-making where people sit in close proximity such as in the living room or inside a car. Restricting users in group decision-making can cause interpersonal conflicts and frustration. To overcome these aspects, my PhD research aims to articulate design principles to support social control. I specifically focus on distributing control across group members to support collaborative group decision-making and enhance social connectedness. To achieve this, I will design entertainment-oriented social control services for the car and the living room. Based on the exploration and designs for the car domain, I will transfer the gained knowledge to the living room, to verify and generalize my findings. This should support in drawing an overall conclusion for the design of general social control entertainment services. Thus, my dissertation contributes to the understanding of the design for future, entertainment-oriented, distributed control systems to best support group collaboration. \n",

      " We propose a model to achieve human localization in indoor environments through intelligent conversation between users and an agent. We investigated the feasibility of conversational localization by conducting two studies. First, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with N = 7 participants and studied the feasibility of localizing users through conversation. We identified challenges posed by users’ language and behavior. Second, we collected N = 800 user descriptions of virtual indoor locations from N = 80 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants to analyze user language. We explored the effects of conversational agent behavior and observed that people describe indoor locations differently based on how the agent presents itself. We devise “Entity Suitability Scale,” a concrete and scalable approach to obtain information to support localization from the myriad of indoor entities users mention in their descriptions. Through this study, we lay foundation to our proposed paradigm of conversational localization.\n",

      " Online shoppers have a lot of information at their disposal when making a purchase decision. They can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. Voice shopping (purchasing items via a Voice assistant such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) is different. Voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel is limited in terms of the amount of information people can and are willing to absorb. Because of this, the system should choose the single most effective nugget of information to help the customer, and present the information succinctly. In this paper we report on a within-subject user study (N = 24), in which we employed three template-based methods that use information from customer reviews, product attributes and search relevance signals to generate helpful supporting information. Our results suggest that: (1) supporting information from customer reviews significantly improves participants perception of system effectiveness (helping them make good decisions); (2) supporting information based on search relevance signals improves user perception of system transparency (providing insight into how the system works). We discuss the implications of our findings for providing supporting information for customers shopping by Voice.\n",

However, little research has investigated the expected quality of the location-related information users of mobile-crowdsourcing platforms, and the levels and types of relevant experience such users expect crowd members to possess, respectively. To fill this gap, we first conducted an interview study with 22 participants, which yielded five key information properties of the answers to location-based questions: objectivity, relativity, specificity, temporal regularity, and variability. Based on his//her stated perceptions of these properties of the requested information, we deemed each participant to desire at least one, and up to 10 main qualities of the information, and seven main aspects of contributors’ experience. A follow-up survey study was then used to quantify the characteristics of a list of location-related information according to the information properties that the 139 respondents perceived that information to have. \n",

We explore possibilities of multiple insects as co-creation interfaces making artworks through insects indirectly, in contrast with BioArt where artworks are made by biological technology. Considering scalability, sustainability, or promotability of applying insects-based devices on creation activities in daily life situations, we utilize on-hand and efficient control system by AR markers and radio-based station, and propose efficient ways of controlling multiple insects reaching goals and transporting objects, and customize flexible option parts. In robust experimental trials, our results showed effective control on a group of three or five cockroaches with at-least 60% reaching accuracy, mobility on carpeted or cable-lines floor, and possible continuous control under certain time duration. Participants in a user study felt positive with Calmbots’ functions and expected more performance or appearance on activities or creation in daily life.\n",

Furthermore, it brings together transnational HCI work that engages with critical ethnic studies as well as postcolonial and decolonial studies to intervene on the field’s long-standing epistemology and site focus on the West and fixation on the nation-state at large. Attention to colonial residual, geopolitical tensions, and historical specificities brings HCI in conversation with geopolitical shifts and their very real impacts on the practice and theory of technology design, while troubling the presumptions of who “gets to be human” in HCI. We invite papers and presentations that seek to: 1) triangulate sites of study; 2) draw from different disciplines, theoretical approaches, and methodologies; and 3) engage themes of transnational capital, race, and technology.\n",

      " In this paper, we explore how expressive auditory gestures added to the speech of a pedagogical agent influence the human-agent relationship and learning outcomes. In a between-subjects experiment, 41 participants assumed the role of a tutor to teach a voice-based agent. The agent used either: expressive interjections (e.g.,“yay”, “hmm”, “oh”), brief expressive musical executions, or no auditory gestures at all (control condition), throughout the interaction. Overall, the results indicate that both gestures can positively affect the interaction, but in particular, interjections can significantly increase feelings of emotional rapport with the agent and enhance motivation in learners. The implications of our findings are discussed as our work adds to the understanding of conversational agent design and can be useful for education as well as other domains in which dialogue systems are used.\n",

      " The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our everyday lives and demands everyone to take countermeasures such as wearing masks or disinfecting their hands. However, while previous work suggests that these countermeasures may profoundly impact biometric authentication, an investigation of the actual impact is still missing. Hence, in this work, we present our findings from an online survey (n=334) on experienced changes in device usage and failures of authentication. Our results show significant changes in personal and shared device usage, as well as a significant increase in experienced failures when comparing the present situation to before the Covid-19 pandemic. From our qualitative analysis of participants’ responses, we derive potential reasons for these changes in device usage and increases in authentication failures. Our findings suggest that making authentication contactless is only one of the aspects relevant to encounter the novel challenges caused by the pandemic.\n",

      " Visitors in smart homes might want to use certain device features, as far as permitted by the device owner (e.g., streaming music on a smart speaker). At the same time, protecting access to features from attackers is crucial, motivating a need for authentication. However, it is unclear if and how smart home visitors should authenticate as they usually do not have access to respective interfaces. We explore considerations for the design of authentication for visitors evolving around, e.g., the visitors themselves as well as the environment and concrete mechanisms. Moreover, we suggest a concrete idea: security questions to authenticate visitors in smart homes. In an interview study (N = 24), we found that owners and visitors appreciated the low effort and would adapt our approach. We conclude with future research directions that we hope will spark further discussions around the design of authentication for smart homes, considering visitors and owners alike.\n",

      " To provide accessible but also usable web interfaces to people with low vision (PLV), academics and regulators provide guidelines in the form of adaptation techniques, as well as adaptable interfaces. Following these recommendations, practitioners developed mainstream solutions such as the Microsoft Immersive Reader. With this kind of solution, PLV can adapt or customize web user interfaces in terms of style and structure. This study aims to explore the adaptation carried out by PLV. A mixed methods research design, including both accessibility and usability concerns, allowed us to capture the user interactions, observe them, and access their expressed perception of usability. Findings show the universal nature of mainstream solutions does not support the diversity of PLV. We believe that universal adaptability features better benefit users with less severe and more common visual impairments. Finally, we discuss potential improvements and future work to support a wider range of PLV.\n",

      " Young adults have high rates of mental health conditions, yet they are the age group least likely to seek traditional treatment. They do, however, seek information about their mental health online, including by filling out online mental health screeners. To better understand online self-screening, and its role in help-seeking, we conducted focus groups with 50 young adults who voluntarily completed a mental health screener hosted on an advocacy website. We explored (1) catalysts for taking the screener, (2) anticipated outcomes, (3) reactions to the results, and (4) desired next steps. For many participants, the screener results validated their lived experiences of symptoms, but they were nevertheless unsure how to use the information to improve their mental health moving forward. Our findings suggest that online screeners can serve as a transition point in young people’s mental health journeys. We discuss design implications for online screeners, post-screener feedback, and digital interventions broadly.\n",

      "Designing aesthetically pleasing single-page graphic designs (”banners”) that appeal to the target recipients is non-trivial and requires considerable human effort. Designers often start by collecting assets like background images, inspirational banners, and relevant taglines/textual phrases, and iterate over variants of the designs by testing different combinations of these assets for their current task. To expand creative processes beyond professionals, it is crucial to accelerate this tedious process of creating design variants. To this end, we propose an algorithm that takes as input multiple image and text elements to generate several visually pleasing banner designs harmonized for text colors, font styles, and the placement of these multimodal assets. The generated layout accounts for background image saliency and uses this to select typographic and color variants yielding the harmonized outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in generating aesthetic banners with the help of a crowdsourced experiment. \n",

      "Difficulties in social communication along with impairments in understanding other's emotions and exhibiting atypical gaze behavior while avoiding social cues are common concerns in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such deficits are reported to be related with social anxiety. Social anxiety often deters the process of skill learning. Given the dramatic rise in the prevalence of ASD and limited availability of trained therapists, getting access to technology-assisted platforms that can estimate one's anxiety and autonomously vary the task challenges for effective skill learning is critical. The potential of gaze-related indices to serve as biomarkers to one's anxiety, and advancement in computing technologies allowing real-time access to gaze-related social signals, we have designed a Virtual Reality (VR)-based anxiety-sensitive social communication task platform. This features a Rule Generator that is used to offer tasks based on the composite effect of task performance and estimated anxiety from one's gaze in an individualized manner. Results of a study with 10 individuals with ASD showed that the anxiety-sensitive system showed promise in eliciting improved task performance and increased looking towards the face region of a communicator displaying emotional expression in comparison to the currently existing system that is blind to one's anxiety. This paves the way towards design of a complementary tool for the therapists.\n",

We contribute a novel system that models the perceived tappability of mobile UI elements with a vision-based deep neural network and helps provide design insights with dataset-level and instance-level explanations of model predictions. Our system retrieves designs from similar mobile UI examples from our dataset using the latent space of our model. We also contribute a novel use of an interpretability algorithm, XRAI, to generate a heatmap of UI elements that contribute to a given tappability prediction. Through several examples, we show how our system can help automate elements of UI usability analysis and provide insights for designers to iterate their designs. In addition, we share findings from an exploratory evaluation with professional designers to learn how AI-based tools can aid UI design and evaluation for tappability issues.\n",

      " The ability to successfully infer private behavioral intentions using publicly-available digital records has a far-reaching impact. Unlike other private attributes such as demographic attributes, an intention oftentimes leads to a near-future behavior. Prior knowledge about such future behaviors can be seen as “actionable intelligence” and constitutes a significantly bigger risk to users’ privacy than knowledge of non-behavioral attributes. In this paper, we present a novel, multidisciplinary methodology for behavioral-intention inference. Using Bayesian-Networks, we model a behavioral intention using a set of causes that influence the intention’s formation, a set of effects that are caused by the intention, and various dependency relations within and between those sets. Unlike the methodologies used in prior attribute-inference works, which are oftentimes tailored to a single target attribute, our methods can be applied to different types of intentions from a diverse set of domains as we demonstrate by applying our model to multiple real-world intention-inference tasks.\n",

      " This work presents NERO, a game concept using the player’s active emotional input to map the emotional state of the player to representative in-game characters. Emotional input in games has been mainly used as a passive measure to adjust for game difficulty or other variables. However the player has not been given the possibility to explore and play with one’s emotions as an active feature. Given the high subjectivity of felt emotions we wanted to focus on the player’s experience of emotional input rather than the objective accuracy of the input sensor. We therefore implemented a proof-of-concept game using heart-rate as a proxy for emotion measurement and through repeated player tests the game mechanics were revised and evaluated. Valuable insight for the design of entertainment-focused emotional input games were gained, including emotional connection despite limited accuracy, influence of the environment and the importance of calibration. The players overall enjoyed the novel game experience and their feedback carries useful implications for future games including active emotional input.\n",

      " This workshop engages the phenomenon of synesthesia to explore how translating between sensory modalities might uncover new ways to experience and represent data: What does it mean to taste a timeline, hear a network, or touch a categorical scale? We employ the method of sketching, which traditionally favors visual representations, and consider what it means to ‘sketch’ in other modalities like sound, taste, and touch. Through a series of rapid, playful activities ideating data representations across sensory modalities, we will explore how the affordances of sketching—like intentional ambiguity—might help designers creatively map data to experience. We will also discuss challenges for sensory sketching in remote, collaborative environments and brainstorm suggestions for digital tools. The outcome of this workshop will be a series of exercises and examples that serve as a toolkit for designers, researchers, and data practitioners to incorporate sketching across the senses into their work.\n",

      " I aim to understand how individuals may be motivated non-financially to collaborate in maintaining evolving information asynchronously. I have developed two systems, Drafty and Sketchy, that provide evidence of achieving this goal at differing timescales. In Drafty, unpaid contributors voluntarily update a tabular dataset of Computer Science professor profiles at a multi-year timescale. In Sketchy, university students simultaneously sketch and co-inspire each other during voluntary UI/UX sketching activities at a sub-hour timescale. I seek to integrate lessons from both systems to develop a theoretical framework that uses a feedback cycle to provide users with practical random examples from evolving information to motivate new contributions. I will further develop this theoretical framework by extending Drafty to generate insights to automatically attract visitors and create the Virtual Readability Lab (VRL) to help users improve their reading performance through personalized readability tests and deepen our understanding of information design human performance. Both systems will give users the agency to seek randomized insights within a naturalistic setting to motivate continuous contributions to each system’s evolving information.\n",

      " Augmented reality (AR) has a diverse range of applications, including language teaching. When studying a foreign language, one of the biggest challenges learners face is memorizing new vocabulary. While augmented holograms are a promising means of supporting this memorization process, few studies have explored their potential in the language learning context. We demonstrate the possibility of using flashcard along with an expressive holographic agent on vocabulary learning. Users scan a flashcard and play an animation that is connected with an emotion related to the word they are seeing. Our goal is to propose an alternative to the traditional use of flashcards, and also introduce another way of using AR in the association process.\n",

      "Many smartwatches are now equipped with front-facing cameras that can detect users’ faces and track the devices’ spatial location relative to the faces in mid-air space. This space can be used as virtual placeholders for user interfaces where users can access them by moving their watch. In this paper, we present a novel face-centered spatial user interface for smartwatches that leverages the mid-air space for augmenting virtual user interfaces. With a pilot study, we first examine the suitable mid-air space that users can access during active use while wearing smartwatches. Next we conduct an online survey investigating users’ attitudes towards using the space to access mid-air user interfaces. More specifically, we focus on the social acceptance of face-centered spatial user interfaces in different locations and in front of different audiences. Results indicate that participants welcomed the idea of face-centered spatial user interfaces, however, the acceptance varied based on where and in front of whom they are using the space. \n",

When the stretch alarm is given, users hold CareMouse and do exercises, and the system collects the wrist movement data and determines whether they follow the accurate stretching motions based on a machine learning algorithm, enabling real-time guidance. We conducted a preliminary user study to understand the users’ perception and user experience of the system. Our results showed the feasibility of CareMouse in guiding stretching exercises interactively.

However, the person perspectives, reusability, and modifiability of the story contents are rarely discussed; also parents may lack the skills of professional story-making. Therefore, we propose an object-oriented three-dimensional (3D) storytelling system, which provides an interactive educational media space for parent-child storytelling. The system supports manipulating reusable character objects and narrating stories from the 1st and 3rd person perspectives in an intuitive manner. Parents can create stories freely based on the background of famous fairy tales and incorporate family education. Our goal is to create a storytelling system for educational entertainment that is fun and conducive to free expression and creativity.\n",

      "With the development of social media, various rumors can be easily spread on the Internet and such rumors can have serious negative effects on society. Thus, it has become a critical task for social media platforms to deal with suspected rumors. However, due to the lack of effective tools, it is often difficult for platform administrators to analyze and validate rumors from a large volume of information on a social media platform efficiently. We have worked closely with social media platform administrators for four months to summarize their requirements of identifying and analyzing rumors, and further proposed an interactive visual analytics system, RumorLens, to help them deal with the rumor efficiently and gain an in-depth understanding of the patterns of rumor spreading. RumorLens integrates natural language processing (NLP) and other data processing techniques with visualization techniques to facilitate interactive analysis and validation of suspected rumors. We propose well-coordinated visualizations to provide users with three levels of details of suspected rumors: an overview displays both spatial distribution and temporal evolution of suspected rumors; a projection view leverages a metaphor-based glyph to represent each suspected rumor and further enable users to gain a quick understanding of their overall characteristics and similarity with each other; a propagation view visualizes the dynamic spreading details of a suspected rumor with a novel circular visualization design, and facilitates interactive analysis and validation of rumors in a compact manner. By using a real-world dataset collected from Sina Weibo, one case study with a domain expert is conducted to evaluate RumorLens. The results demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.\n",

      " Text summarization is an example of a complex algorithm with a single direct input to output user operation. As different types of users e.g. students, journalists, etc. adopt these algorithms, it is imperative that user experience with text summarization AI systems is modified to allow agency. To explore this, we designed an interactive multi-document summarization system, called Living Documents, that allows agency over the summarization process. We evaluated this system in a preliminary study with 25 students identified from Prolific. The students perform summarization tasks using the control functions in our system. Results from this study show that these functions contributed to the user’s understanding of how summarization works and this understanding slightly impacts user trust in our system positively. We discuss our experience designing for user control of a normally automated, complex process that produces immutable output and the future implications for other applications. \n",

      "Privacy-invasive sensors such as cameras and microphones in smart devices (e.g., Facebook Portal, Google Nest Hub Max, Amazon Echo Show) are now ubiquitous in a user’s private setting, which raises users’ privacy concerns of always listening and monitoring. To address such privacy concerns, we developed ParaSight, a smart speaker add-on device that communicates to users sensing data transfer. ParaSight transmits the information yet speaks out loud what is being transmitted to a smart speaker connected to a server via utterances by leveraging the smart speaker’s ability to understand human languages. Communicating sensing data as utterances brings two benefits: (i) a user can hear and understand what data, and when, are being transferred as utterances are human-understandable; (ii) raw data are processed locally and only filtered signals can be uploaded to a server. ParaSight, for example, can receive and locally process raw data of a user’s audio and video data (e.g., snoring sound, workout video), and only transmit the filtered data to a server. We demonstrate two work-in-progress applications—snoring detection and home training applications—to show ParaSight’s use cases. \n",

      " HCI is increasingly concerned with health information quality and spread of misinformation on social media. Despite many major platforms having been adopted across the world, the situated evaluation and sharing of health information is underexplored across diverse health systems and cultural and political contexts. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we study the navigation of health information on social media in urban and rural South India, backdropped by plural knowledges around health and the specific politics and sociality of health and social media in this setting. We use Ivan Illich’s concept of tools for conviviality [49] to distinguish between how people creatively use tools versus how tools manage and impose values on people—participants aimed to use health information towards care beyond institutionalized healthcare, but insidious misinformation and information-sharing practices served to commodify, spark uncertainty in, and discipline caring behavior. We use our findings to expand understandings of the use of health information on social media and how positionality shapes how people are affected by and respond to misinformation. We also draw attention to the structural aspects of health misinformation in the Indian context and how the design of social media platforms might play a role in addressing it.\n",

Currently, CUIs are mainly applied to help improve the user experience with quantitative surveys. We describe the development of a Hybrid User Interface (HUI) prototype that combines a Graphical User interface (GUI) and a CUI to conduct a fully automated but structured qualitative survey according to the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT). This paper describes a pilot study that we conducted to inform the design of the HUI and to converge to a prototype that is sufficiently mature and robust to be used in a more extensive follow-up study. Our experiences with developing this HUI may help others avoid pitfalls and profit from the tools and lessons we have learned as part of our design process.\n",

      "Misconceptions surrounding disability and sexuality are still prevalent and people with disabilities are often depicted as asexual and incapable to lead fulfilling sex lives. As a result, many individuals with disabilities struggle to access adequate sex education with negative consequences such as unplanned pregnancies, body image issues and sexual exploitation. To explore needs and practices for accessing relevant and reliable information about disability and sexuality, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. Results show that there are several topics which participants thought should be better explored in the context of disability and sexuality, but most available sex education resources are not inclusive. Moreover, people with disabilities, especially when young or less used to self-advocate for their own needs, face difficulties engaging in meaningful conversations around sexuality. Based on the results of our research, we make recommendations for areas where HCI research could significantly contribute to make intimate interactions more accessible.\n",

      "This paper presents a targeted system to help Chinese deaf children learn both sign language and Chinese characters in early language learning. The system combines sign recognition and in-air writing techniques with games so that children can practice sign language and Chinese character writing at the same time. Sign recognition is used to assess the accuracy of sign language and in-air writing records the process of writing Chinese characters. In addition, the game adds to the learning fun and makes children more willing to complete learning tasks. We have developed a prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of a simultaneous Chinese sign language and Chinese character teaching system based on gesture recognition and in-air writing. We expect that this system will increase children's willingness and efficiency to learn sign language and Chinese characters, and eventually be used to assist in early language education for deaf children in the Chinese region.\n",

Despite the great potential of working in this way, recent research suggests that interdisciplinary collaborations and competing stakeholder interests can be challenging to initiate and manage, with the result that knowledge and expertise from different fields are not always well integrated. The aim of this workshop is to bring together stakeholders from HCI, surgical science, and surgical practice and technology to investigate the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration, specifically identifying actionable strategies to coordinate and improve efforts towards designing, developing, evaluating, and iterating on the next generation of surgical solutions. The workshop will address current limitations in interdisciplinary collaboration, and identify opportunities for surgical technology stakeholders to make contributions across the entire development life cycle. In the longer term, the workshop will contribute towards the development of a pragmatic collaboration framework encompassing diverse research paradigms, compatible with surgical practice, and supportive of longitudinal evaluation.\n",

However, wearing masks disturbs emotional interaction through facial expressions, which is a critical component in emotional development. Therefore, a negative impact on adolescent emotional development is predicted. To solve this problem, we design a narrative-based game Evoker that uses real-time facial expression recognition. In this game, players are asked to identify an emotion from narrative contexts in missions, and make a facial expression appropriate for the context to clear the challenges. Our game provides an opportunity to practice reading emotional contexts and expressing appropriate emotions, which has a high potential for promoting emotional development of adolescents.\n",

We propose a new system in HCI that uses computational tools to map text onto flavors and thus allow users to ”eat their words” in the form of a custom hot cocoa blend created from written journal entries, helping people engage in reflection. Our more open-ended approach to computer-augmented reflection explores new tangible mediums and methods to facilitate a sense of playful fluidity in machine interactions. A deep learning pipeline is developed that finds meaning within user journals by identifying similar poems/stories/texts in a pre-collected corpus. A dispenser outputs a drink mix with flavors based on these discovered meanings, and prints a receipt to help users make sense of their experience. To encourage disclosure and create a reflective mood, we model our experience based on journaling at an intimate cafe. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates strong promise in this approach.\n",

      " HCI research often involves accessing and storing information in databases. However, in case of a database node failure, researchers could experience significant work delays, monetary costs, and data loss. How can researchers who have little or no knowledge of systems and infrastructures ensure that their data collection source is reliable and maximally available for accessing and storing data? To answer this question, we surveyed 11 HCI researchers. Using the findings from the survey, we developed Styx++—an easy-to-integrate open-source solution that bundles together existing tools and concepts, providing HCI researchers with a reliable distributed system for their database needs. Styx++ is a hybrid solution involving both the Paxos and Chain Replication Protocol, providing strong consistency and high availability to minimize the risks of single-point failures in a traditional database system setup. Our evaluation of Styx++ against benchmark solutions shows promising results of an increase in reliability without substantial performance degradation.\n",

      " The majority of online video content remains inaccessible for blind people due to the lack of audio descriptions. Content creators have traditionally relied on professionals to author audio descriptions, but their service is costly and not readily available. In this research, I introduce four threads of research that I will conduct for my Ph.D. dissertation, aimed to create methods and tools that are both time- and cost-effective in providing good quality audio descriptions. They are: (i) The development and evaluation of mixed-ability collaboration authoring tool, (ii) The formative study to uncover the feedback pattern from the reviewer, (iii) the evaluation and generation of real-time supports for novice authors to write AD, and (iv) the design, development, and evaluation of a system that demonstrate the utility of semi-automatically authoring AD. I believe these four research threads help me to uncover a cheaper solution to generate audio description. Hence, motivating the content creator to include this accessibility feature in the video production process and making the existing and upcoming videos accessible.\n",

In addition, recent advances in novel sensing and interface technologies, accessibility studies and system design open up new possibilities and can bring in different perspectives for personal health sensing. We believe that joining the forces in such interdisciplinary work is a key to moving the field of personal health sensing forward.

      "The increased adoption of smart home cameras (SHCs) foregrounds issues of surveillance, power, and privacy in homes and neighborhoods. However, questions remain about how people are currently using these devices to monitor and surveil, what the benefits and limitations are for users, and what privacy and security tensions arise between primary users and other stakeholders. We present an empirical study with 14 SHC users to understand how these devices are used and integrated within everyday life. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews, we investigate users’ motivations, practices, privacy concerns, and social negotiations. Our findings highlight the SHC as a perceptually powerful and spatially sensitive device that enables a variety of surveillant uses outside of basic home security—from formally surveilling domestic workers, to casually spying on neighbors, to capturing memories. We categorize surveillant SHC uses, clarify distinctions between primary and non-primary users, and highlight under-considered design directions for addressing power imbalances among primary and non-primary users.\n",

      " Social robots can be applied in different settings to enhance experiences for humans. Understanding physical and behavioural aspects of robot design is important to promote acceptance in human-robot interaction. In this study, we focus on robot initiative-taking as a behavioural aspect and investigate how it influences human perception and emotion during human-robot interaction. We built on previous work using questionnaires to evaluate user impressions in the presence or absence of robot activeness (initiative-taking). We also used Galvanic skin response (GSR) as a physiological measure to gauge participants’ emotion during interaction. Questionnaire analysis confirmed that generally active robot behaviour improved human impression. Moreover, the order of interaction seems to matter for participants to take more notice of robot initiative-taking. GSR analysis supported the questionnaire results, showing that on average participants were more emotionally aroused during an active interaction and that order of interaction somewhat mattered. \n",

      " Thermal cues in the car can be used as an alternative to audio and vibration feedback to lessen the burden on the often overloaded visual channel. This paper presents an investigation of a heated car seat to evaluate the effectiveness of the heating for feedback purposes. The temperature changes of a heated car seat were measured without and with seated passengers to assess the heating capabilities in general and to understand the temperature interaction with a seated person. A user study (N=12) investigated the recognition times during a simulated driving task. Temperature changes during driving simulation were detected on average in under 1min, with an average increase of around 0.33℃ on the backrest (0.36℃ on seat). These initial results can be used as basis and inspiration for further investigations to lessen the visual channel with thermal cues.\n",

      "Home health aides are a vulnerable group of frontline caregivers who provide personal and medically-oriented care in patients’ homes. Their work is difficult and unpredictable, involving a mix of physical and emotional labor as they adapt to patients’ changing needs. Our paper presents an exploratory, qualitative study with 32 participants, that investigates design opportunities for Interactive Voice Assistants (IVAs) to support aides’ essential care work. We explore challenges and opportunities for IVAs to (1) fill gaps in aides’ access to information and care coordination, (2) assist with decision making and task completion, (3) advocate on behalf of aides, and (4) provide emotional support. We then discuss key implications of our work, including how materiality may impact perceived ownership and usage of IVAs, the need to carefully consider tensions around surveillance, accountability, data collection, and reporting, and the challenges of centering aides as essential workers in complex home health care contexts. \n",

      " We describe how sheets of metalized mylar can be cut and then “inflated” into complex 3D forms with electrostatic charge for use in digitally-controlled, shape-changing displays. This is achieved by placing and nesting various cuts, slits and holes such that mylar elements repel from one another to reach an equilibrium state. Importantly, our technique is compatible with industrial and hobbyist cutting processes, from die and laser cutting to handheld exacto-knives and scissors. Given that mylar film costs <$1 per m2, we can create self-actuating 3D objects for just a few cents, opening new uses in low-cost consumer goods. We describe a design vocabulary, interactive simulation tool, fabrication guide, and proof-of-concept electrostatic actuation hardware. We detail our technique’s performance metrics along with qualitative feedback from a design study. We present numerous examples generated using our pipeline to illustrate the rich creative potential of our method. \n",

      " Humans are unique in working collaboratively by sharing and understanding intentions. However, digital collaboration is daunting, especially in creative design life cycles, due to non-linear workflows and lack of micro-alignments coupled with the need for robust network connectivity. We present a formative study with creatives to identify key themes in conflicts that arise in this space. We introduce CollabColor, a user interface that aids in resolving conflicts for two users synchronously collaborating on a low-touch creative task. More specifically, given an uncolored line-art on a canvas and a set of reference images from the users as input, we arrive at design goals for an intelligent system that can enhance our interface. We find that such a system must provide non-obtrusive interventions during real-time collaboration to ensure that the final colorization of the art is coherent, and all the users’ aligned preferences are incorporated.\n",

      "Acu.ation is an intervention that aims to mediate the urge to smoke by pairing a wearable device that delivers transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) with a mobile application that provides Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP)(Figure 1). Given the pervasiveness of cigarette smoking, high rates of relapse, and limitations of existing treatments, it is critical to explore new methods of relapse prevention. Our solution draws from acupuncture's global use in treating addiction and recent evidence that non-invasive TEAS can reduce the urge to smoke after exposure to a drug-related cue. Specifically, we have designed a device formed to four acupoints (LI4, PC8, PC6, and TH5) located on the wrist and hand, and programmed to deliver 5-15mA stimulation. Through a paired mobile application, individuals are simultaneously guided through an MBRP intervention to help them take control of their response to the trigger. Together, this system provides real-time relief from the urge to smoke so individuals can better engage with cognitive behavioral relapse prevention strategies in high risk moments.\n",

      "Self-harm is particularly prevalent amongst young people, with adverse consequences in terms of later wellbeing, vocational outcomes, and increased risk of suicide. Although many studies have explored self-harm, it remains difficult to predict and prevent, in part because the mental states that typically precede self-harm are highly variable and triggers can be unclear. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM), where participants are asked to record personal data many times during the day, allows researchers to capture these variable mental states and their relation to self-harming behaviour. We conducted a series of co-design workshops involving young people with lived experience of self-harm and researchers with a special interest in ESM to identify the requirements of both groups for an ESM digital platform for investigating self-harm. We describe their key requirements, some of which are conflicting, and suggest ways that these could be addressed to develop an effective ESM platform.\n",

We implement this using electrical-muscle-stimulation (EMS) of the neck muscles, which turns the head around its yaw (left/right) and pitch (up/down) axis. As the first exploration of EMS for head actuation, we characterized which muscles can be robustly actuated. Then, we demonstrated how it enables interactions not possible before by building a range of applications, such as (1) directly changing the user's head orientation to locate objects in AR; (2) a sound controller that uses neck movements as both input and output; (3) synchronizing head orientations of two users, which enables a user to communicate head nods to another user while listening to music; and (4) rendering force feedback from VR punches on the head by actuating the user's neck.\n",

      "Personas has evolved since Alan Cooper coined the term in 1999, moving into new domains, new ways of collecting data, and with novel ways of presenting the persona profiles. From the beginning, personas was linked to software design, expressing the need for empathy with end-users. This is still the case today, but we want to show how this is executed in different domains, not only in software, and how different forms of presentation relate to empathy. Thus, the persona course investigates the relationship between data collection, the representation of data as persona profiles, and empathy.\n",

      " Now more than ever, people are using online platforms to communicate. Twitch, the foremost platform for live game streaming, offers many communication modalities. However, the platform lacks representation of social cues and signals of the audience experience, which are innately present in live events. For this demonstration, we present an interactive experience that captures the audience energy and response in a game streaming context. We designed a survival shooter game and integrated a custom-communication modality (Commons Sense) in which remote audience attendees’ heart rates will be sensed via webcam, averaged, and fed into a video game as input to affect sound, lighting, and difficulty. \n",

      " As machine learning (ML) became more relevant to our lives, ML education for college students without technical background arose important. However, not many educational games designed to suit challenges they experience exist. We introduce an educational game Classy Trash Monster (CTM), designed to better educate ML and data dependency to non-major students who learn ML for the first time. The player can easily learn to train a classification model and solve tasks by engaging in simple game activities designed according to an ML pipeline. Simple controls, positive rewards, and clear audiovisual feedback makes game easy to play even for novice players. The playtest result showed that players were able to learn basic ML concepts and how data can impact model results, and that the game made ML feel less difficult and more relevant. However, proper debriefing session seems crucial to prevent misinterpretations that may occur in the learning process.\n",

Our wearable wristband TapType integrates accelerometers that sense vibrations arising from finger taps against a passive surface, from which our Bayesian neural network estimates a probability distribution over the fingers of the hand. Given a pre-defined key-finger mapping, our text entry decoder fuses these predictions with the character priors of an n-gram language model to decode the input text entered by the user. TapType combines high portability with sustained rapid bimanual input across the full space, which we demonstrate at the example of supplementing text input on mobile touch devices, in eyes-free scenarios using audio feedback, and in a situated Mixed Reality scenario to enable typing outside visual control with passive haptic feedback. \n",

      "In iterative physical object creation, only the latest design state is manifested in the physical artifact, while information about previous versions are lost. This makes it challenging to keep track of changes and developments in iterative physical design. In this paper, we propose the concept of Tangible Version Control (TVC), inspired by the visualizations of traditional version control systems. In TVC, the real-world artifact itself is used for exploring its alternative versions in physical space, while comparisons to an alternative version are displayed seamlessly on the artifact with the use of augmented reality. Our implementation of TVC includes three different comparison modes, namely SideBySide, Overlay, and Differences. Furthermore, we discuss the anticipated use, opportunities, and challenges of using TVC in the future for individual users as well as for asynchronous collaborative work. \n",

While existing infrastructures are in dire need of maintenance, additional infrastructures are simultaneously being built to address imbalances in network access and distribution. My dissertation project attends to these intersecting precarities as a way to reconsider how digital infrastructures can be reworked to address overlapping questions of environmental and digital inequities. My research is situated within marginalized coastal communities in south Louisiana, where legacies of petrochemical extraction has led to deep socioeconomic and ecological disparities, while increased intensity of storms and floods have begun to impede and damage an already sparse network infrastructure. In my project, I use archival, ethnographic, and design research methods to examine longer histories of environmental degradation, investigate current practices of maintaining and developing network infrastructures, and develop approaches for researchers in HCI and related computing fields to re-envision just and equitable network infrastructures.\n",

      " In this paper, we present PriCheck, a browser extension that provides privacy-relevant information about smart devices (e.g., in an online shop). This information is oftentimes hidden, difficult to access, and, thus, often neglected when buying a new device. With PriCheck, we enable users to make informed purchase decisions. We conducted an exploratory study using the browser extension in a simplified (mock) online shop for smart devices. Participants chose devices with and without using the extension. We found that participants (N = 11) appreciated the usability and available information of PriCheck, helping them with informed decisions for privacy-preserving products. We hope our work will stimulate further discussion on how to make privacy information for novel products available, understandable, and easy to access for users.\n",

      "As virtual reality (VR) is emerging in the tech sector, developers and designers are under pressure to create immersive experiences for their products. However, the current curricula from top institutions focus primarily on technical considerations for building VR applications, missing out on concerns and usability problems specific to VR interaction design. To better understand current needs, we examined the status quo of existing university pedagogies by carrying out a content analysis of undergraduate and graduate courses about VR and related areas offered in the major citadels of learning and conducting interviews with 7 industry experts. Our analysis reveals that the current teaching practices underemphasize design thinking, prototyping, and evaluation skills, while focusing on technical implementation. We recommend VR curricula should emphasize design principles and guidelines, offer training in prototyping and ideation, prioritize practical design exercises while providing industry insights, and encourage students to solve VR design problems beyond the classroom. \n",

      " Most literature has already shown that virtual reality, concretely, 360-degrees video can have influence on affective skills in multiple applications from education to medicine. This thesis aims to go one step further, real-time 360-degree video communications. Researchers commonly based their experiments on controlled environments and participants with specific characteristics which reduce the reproducibility and ecological validity of the methodologies. We propose to design a methodology based on questionnaires and the use of biosensors to jointly assess technical and socioemotional features in bidirectional immersive communications. For that, we first present some research questions and then choose the tools, stimuli, and use case to answer them. The use case selected as starting point to validate the methodology is tele-education. This thesis is an invitation to leave the comfort zone and question the usage of methodologies that have been highly proven with previous technologies, but which may as well be insufficient to address the challenges of new communications. \n",

      " Accessibility in a hospital is challenging for people in low-income countries due to a lack of accessible mediums to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information. This results in delays and stress but can also result in sub-optimal treatment or sometimes a complete lack of treatment for the visitors. Sensible physical and digital interventions can greatly ease the experience of visitors and reduce the work-related stress of healthcare providers. We present a case study on wayfinding and service design for a mega ophthalmic care facility that has a daily footfall of 2500 patients. From our mixed-methods study we identified: (i) there are very few accessible mediums available to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information; (ii) there is a lack of inclusively designed interventions to accommodate the diversity of visitors; (iii) spatial ambiguity and situational impairment due to crowd density exasperate the situation and (iv) there exist missing as well as misleading information. We developed a spectrum of solutions on the environmental and digital infrastructures available within this context to deliver wayfinding and procedural information. We completed a progressive intervention across digital and physical mediums over a duration of 18 months. This has shown the impact of each medium on visitors’ experience. We found the choice of interface to access information depends on the ease of access, and ease of access depends on visitors’ abilities. Therefore, both the environment and digital mediums are found to be useful for visitors. Based on these empirical findings, we draw recommendations for an inclusive service design that incorporates using elements of the environment, human and digital infrastructure to support a more positive healthcare visitors experience.\n",

      " Gameplay spectatorship has developed significantly over the last decade, necessitating the need to design more engaging spectator experiences. In order to do this effectively, however, we must first better understand spectator behavior and motivations. In this paper, we build on the results of a previous work examining interaction preferences of remote livestream spectators depending on their user type, and report a new qualitative study exploring the underlying motivations that shape the experience of those engaged in interactive spectating. Our results highlight five main themes (entertainment, team support, learning, caster, social) that motivate spectators to engage with interactive esports experiences. This work will motivate ongoing research in this domain by promoting conversations about livestream spectator engagement and motivations, and facilitating engaging spectator experiences. \n",

      " Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. For example, studies have shown that autistic children are receptive to SARs in therapy, and achieve similar learning outcomes compared to human-delivered therapy. Given the sensitive nature of therapy and the current state of autonomous robots, however, SARs are in practice teleoperated by a therapist who controls their motion and dialogue. This presents an opportunity to produce more effective SAR teleoperation interfaces in the context of therapy for autistic children. In this paper, I outline research for improving teleoperation interfaces of SARs through (1) analyzing current teleoperation usage, (2) interviewing teleoperators about their needs, and (3) implementing and evaluating varied designs for teleoperation interfaces.\n",

      "Our everyday digital tasks require access to information from a wide range of applications and systems. Although traditional search systems can help find information, they usually operate within one application (e.g., email client or web browser) and require the user’s cognitive effort and attention to formulate proper search queries. In this paper, we demonstrate EntityBot, a system that proactively provides useful and supporting entities across application boundaries without requiring explicit query formulation. Our methodology is to exploit the context from screen frames captured every 2 seconds to recommend relevant entities for the current task. Recommendations are not restricted to only documents but include various kinds of entities, such as applications, documents, contact persons, and keywords representing the tasks. Recommendations are actionable, that is, a user can perform actions on recommended entities, such as opening documents and applications. The EntityBot also includes support for interactivity, allowing the user to affect the recommendations by providing explicit feedback on the entities. The usefulness of entity recommendations and their impact on user behavior has been evaluated in a user study based on real-world tasks. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the system had an actual impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.\n",

      " Spatially sonified audio is frequently used in virtual environments to serve as an object localization cue. However, spatializers that are available to the general public typically have their limitations and lead to sound localization errors. By combining it with non-spatial sonification, the technique of encoding information with perceptual attributes of the sound, the localization errors of spatially sonified audio could be reduced. However, the encoded information would require higher mental effort to understand, which could be a concern under high task load. In this paper, we conducted a subjective study to compare spatial sonification against combined auditory cue using spatial and non-spatial sonification for target localization. We tested both methods under low and high task load. Our results show that combined sonification could significantly reduce the errors in localizaiton, but the advantage would be influenced by higher task load. Further, we compared several different non-spatial sonification methods for encoding depth information. Our experiment shows that both pitch and pulse frequency modulation are feasible for presenting depth of the target. Our results could contribute as a first step to a general guideline of designing sonification method as target localization cue.\n",

      " Machines, computers, and robots play an increasingly important role in our personal and professional lives. In manufacturing industries, the direct physical collaboration between workers and robots is already reality today. To understand how humans perceive this collaboration, investigations regarding the effect of different robot behaviors and the characteristics that influence the perception by humans are required. Existing findings on the effect of human attributes and human-like appearance of robots point out several possibilities that improve interactions between humans and robots. However, these studies predominantly focus on humanoid robots. With regard to the increasing number of industrial robots and the arising economic potential of automation, the objective of my research is to gain in-depth understanding of human perception of robot movement behaviors. Achieving this requires insights on possible and perceptible robot behaviors in the non-humanoid field, how they are perceived and how they can be mapped to acceptance by humans. Based on this understanding, resulting interactions can be improved by adapting relevant behavior to the individual’s preferences. In view of new technologies and possibilities, it might even be possible to use real time data to classify humans and let robots adapt their behavior automatically. \n",

      "While users often share accounts with others, currently most accounts support only single user interactions. Within industry, Netflix and Disney+ providing profiles within accounts are testaments to popular services identifying and responding to user needs in this context but the solutions here are mostly naïve. Within academia, while sharing practices are of interest, the practicalities of dealing with them are yet to be studied. This paper highlights said gap in research and reports the preliminary findings of 4 user focus groups that reveal practical challenges and future expectations around the experience of sharing, social implications and user privacy, which when accounted for would support users in their sharing interactions. We intend to extend these findings by integrating them with expert interviews with ‘makers’ who research and work on said technologies, to produce a holistic set of design recommendations that form a practical guide for support around account sharing.\n",

      " Comparing products, features, brands, or ideas relative to one another is a common goal in user experience (UX) and market research. While Likert-type scales and ordinal stack ranks are often employed as prioritization methods, they are subject to several psychometric shortcomings. We introduce the numeric forced rank, a lightweight approach that overcomes some of the limitations of standard methods and allows researchers to collect absolute ratings, relative preferences, and subjective comments using a single scale. The approach is optimal for UX and market research, but is also easily employed as a structured decision-making exercise outside of consumer research. We describe how the numeric forced rank was used to determine the name of a new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) feature, present the findings, and make recommendations for future research.\n",

      "Specialized software tools have become essential to many forms of content creation, yet poor accessibility of these tools has led to unequitable opportunities for disabled content creators. My doctoral research contributes to our knowledge of accessibility in computer-supported content creation by studying the context of audio production by people with vision impairments. Through interviews, observations, and content analysis, I develop a comprehensive understanding of how accessibility unfolds during various stages of audio content production for blind audio producers – from learning the tools and practices to developing and exhibiting professional expertise while also pushing back against ableist productivity standards and stereotypes. Critically reflecting upon these insights, I am developing a system to scaffold accessible learning of audio production software in a way that recognizes and leverages the expertise and practices developed by blind audio production trainers. The final phase of my dissertation will evaluate this system with both blind trainers and learners to understand how interactive technologies can promote accessible learning in computer-supported content creation.\n",

      " Due to public concerns over touch-based disease transmission, tangible and embedded interfaces are perhaps the most unsuited technology during a pandemic. Even so, this case study documents the development and evaluation of such a system from early 2020 when people were told to avoid actions that might spread the virus (e.g., touch). Adding to the challenge, the Lookout was installed outside in a city centre for widespread public use. Despite these challenges, a COVID-safe touchable device was embedded and extensively used. This Case Study reports the co-creation of the device noting COVID restriction adaptations over a nine-month deployment. Our contributions are twofold: the study acts as a case-point of the impact of the unique COVID design context, with lessons for future pandemic scenarios; and, given we had over 10,000 users at a time when people were cautious about using shared devices or services, we surface some design characteristics that can promote the use of public technology.\n",

As a way of helping the players with focusing on their sense of sound, the Melody of Mysterious Stones makes use of spatialized sounds as game elements. Our play tests showed that game players enjoyed playing missions with spatial audio elements. Also, they reported that spatial audio helped them with focusing on their sense of sound and therefore felt more engaged in meditation materials.\n",

      " In this paper, we present ChromoPrint, a method which leverages photochromic dyes to convert resin-based 3D printing - a process that traditionally prints objects from a single material and therefore only a single color - into a multi-color 3D printing process. Rather than using a standard single-color resin, our resin contains a mixture of photochromic dyes that can transition into different colors when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. We modify an existing resin printer to incorporate an RGB projection system which can control each of the photochromic dyes in the resin during printing. By saturating the dyes with a UV light prior to mixing into the resin, and then projecting combinations of RGB light onto each layer after it has been UV cured, we can color objects directly during the printing process. We discuss the formulation of the photochromic resin, the modifications to the printer, the user interface that allows a user to apply color to a 3D model, and the software pipeline that outputs the build instructions to the 3D printer, including the exposure times for curing with UV light and for coloring with the RGB projector. \n",

      " As COVID-19 spreads across the globe and the number of deaths continues to rise, the heartbreaking experiences are being replaced by collective mourning. As German journalist and pacifist Kurt Tukholsky once said: “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”.  When we look back at the help-seeking posts of those who were lost, those who died of unconfirmed COVID-19 testing reports; those who committed suicide out of despair; those whose life-saving medical equipment were being taken away and those who lost their lives due to overwork and infection from their patients... Many of them were not included in the official statistics, and they are likely to be forgotten over time. They were not being treated fairly when they were alive, and they were not being mentioned after they passed away.  We spoke to one of those families. One daughter said: “After this pandemic, who will remember someone such as my mother – she had nowhere to go for medical treatment; she was rejected by the hospital, and she had to die at home?”  This is one of the reasons why we built this online platform. We want to document as many people who have left us because of the pandemic as possible. Our website also includes the help-seeking information these people posted before they passed away. These are the evidences they have left in a particular moment in this pandemic. We hope to provide a space for family members to express their grief and for the public to mourn the dead. Behind every number is a life.  ”Unfinished Farewell” can be viewed at www.farewell.care and www.jiabaoli.org/covid19\n",

      " The dark side of technology, such as technology overuse, has received growing concern. Prior studies have developed a variety of stand-alone techniques to support technology non-use, but few have attempted to build interventions directly into technologies to regulate usage. My research seeks to address this issue in the context of games by exploring the relationship players intend to have with games, especially their desired balance between play and non-play, and designing built-in interventions in games to help support this relationship. I will conduct qualitative interviews to understand players’ ideal relationships with games, and quantitative experiments to investigate the impact of built-in interventions on such relationships. Through these investigations, I attempt to develop a theoretical framework to understand users’ intended relationship with technologies and provide guidance on intervention designs that contribute to digital well-being. \n",

We found statistically significant differences in usability, user experience and NPS metrics between employees and customers, with the employees being more critical compared to the customers. We postulate and present some evidence that this difference is due to employees implicitly comparing B2B with B2C e-commerce sites and therefore expecting the experience of a B2C site for a B2B site. Such a comparison, fosters a bias, which has implications for businesses that host B2B e-commerce sites. We conclude by sketching recommendations for practitioners on how to go about such a bias.\n",

      " Perceiving images and drawing are fundamental parts of human life, and thus access to them should be a universal right. However, there is a large breach for people with visual impairments to access diverse graphics, let alone drawing. There are several techniques of tactile graphics, such as swell paper, Braille embossing, and thermoform that help to alleviate this gap. However, in developing countries, the high cost and lack of access make them impractical. In this work, we describe our experience improving access to tactile graphics and drawing in Colombia. We created low-cost, effective and efficient, tactile graphics and drawing techniques that improve on current solutions. These techniques were created from the best practices of two projects adapting pieces from the Colombian art heritage [52, 53] for blind and visually impaired people. They were then applied to a third project: running a virtual tactile drawing club with blind and visually impaired participants in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned from these experiences are presented in this paper with the hope they can help the community democratize access to tactile graphics.\n",

      "Social media (SM) is a popular accessible form of smart memory vaults. Prior work shows that users are still unable to understand how their shared memories are used by smart systems to create Smart Interactions involving Personal Memories (SIPMs). This can lead to negative social repercussions such as cyberbullying. This work investigates the most memorable SIPMs on Facebook for Egyptian users and their impact on platform usage. We conducted an online survey (N=53) requesting critical incident reports about surprising Facebook SIPMs. The most remembered SIPMs were: customizing advertisements, cuing offline interactions, sharing data with third parties and personalizing the newsfeed. Our results suggest that SIPMs, particularly customized advertisements act as ambient memory augmentation solutions to the users’ shared memories. Additionally, negative platform perception does not necessarily translate into reduction of platform usage. Our work inspires the discussion about users expectations towards ambient usage of their data on smart memory vaults. \n",

However, lecture videos limit feasible pedagogical approaches, since there are no interactions that students would engage with and learn from in synchronous classes. In this study, we proposed virtual peers - virtual TAs and students that interact with each other as though they are watching the video for the first time together - to help real students learn from observing their interactions. We conducted two rounds of interviews and participatory designs with instructors and TAs to design an authoring tool that would help them create engaging virtual characters and author five types of pedagogically valuable interactions. The design received favorable preliminary feedback from instructors. They expect the tool to add valuable components that are missing from lecture videos with minimal additional effort on their parts.\n",

      "In-product feedback mechanisms allow for capturing user feedback while the user is engaging with the product or service. Traditionally in-product feedback has focused on metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) [21] and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) [5] which look to measure customer loyalty or overall product satisfaction. By introducing complementary user experience (UX) metrics that are focused on user outcomes, UX teams have greater insight into measuring the successes or challenges of their users in the context of use. This case study describes and discusses the process employed and the lessons learned while designing and implementing a user-centered in-product feedback system. We specifically call out challenges and opportunities around aligning with business outcomes, navigating current frameworks, unlocking self-serve data to stakeholders, informing strategy, and feeding additional research. In conclusion, we present these learnings as a framework, dubbed BLUE, to help other UX teams create in-product feedback mechanisms.\n",

This study focuses on women's familial relationships through interviews with 6 Irish women about their relationships with their mothers, as well as ways in which they maintain the care of themselves and others within these relationships. Our thematic analysis of this data generated four themes: self-other care, leaky boundaries, changes over the lifecourse, and space and conflict – from which we ideated a series of design concepts, six of which are presented here with critiques from our participants. From this exploratory work, we delineate four directions for future HCI research into women's close relationships.\n",

      " Laparoscopic surgeries require a high degree of visuo-spatial coordination between attending and resident surgeons. The challenge is intensified when surgeons communicate verbally using visual cues. Most prior work in the space supports attending surgeons to give clearer instructions to residents. However, in order to achieve intraoperative success, shared understanding, coordination and trust between faculty-resident dyads is essential. Our work focuses on unpacking both attending and resident surgeons’ experiences during intraoperative operations. We perform an interview study with 6 attending and 3 resident surgeons, in which we ask participants to share their thoughts on the utility and feasibility of capturing surgical dyads’ joint visual attention (JVA) during live surgeries. We find that attending and resident surgeons have contrasting and complementary views about autonomy, communication and coordination during surgeries. We also see positive attitudes towards capturing surgeons’ visual attention during live surgeries and using the data to support communication, coordination and instruction. \n",

This paper introduces the LoFi sketch dataset, an open-access dataset of hand-drawn smartphone LoFi sketches, to facilitate this research domain. It contains 4,527 LoFi sketches annotated with 21 categories of UI elements. Through annotations, it provides the category, position, and location of 41,560 constituent UI elements. We collected these sketches from 361 participants from 76 countries through questionnaires and by acquiring premade LoFi sketches to ensure the dataset’s diversity and ecological validity. These sketches were drawn using pen, pencil, mouse, touch, and stylus as the input medium and available in raster and vector format. This dataset enables further research on several avenues of AI assistance in UI design, such as UI element detection, sketch completion, UI layout refinement, and Sketch-based image retrieval. \n",

This makes it especially suitable for implementations of the World-as-Support AR paradigm, where augmented experiences should be shared and situated. We contribute the design principles and methodology used in the development of the hardware and software of the AR Magic Lantern.

      " Codesign brings together users and creators of a product to collaboratively determine how that product will manifest. In this case study of codesign, the Adobe Lightroom team collaborated with 12 photographers in a 4-day workshop to envision an in-app community space for photographic expression and learning. We discuss findings from the codesign workshop, including core values for the envisioned photography community: authenticity, connection and growth, and how we translated these themes to the design of the product. This case study demonstrates a successful codesign effort within the context of user-centered design at a large company.\n",

FoolProofJoint achieves this by modifying finger joint patterns. Wherever possible, FoolProofJoint makes similar looking pieces fully interchangeable, thereby speeding up the user's visual search for a matching piece. When that is not possible, FoolProofJoint gives finger joints a unique pattern of individual finger placements so as to fit only with the correct piece, thereby preventing erroneous assembly.\n",

      "From creating input devices to rendering tangible information, the field of HCI is interested in using kinematic mechanisms to create human-computer interfaces. Yet, due to fabrication and design challenges, it is often difficult to create kinematic devices that are compact and have multiple reconfigurable motional degrees of freedom (DOFs) depending on the interaction scenarios. In this work, we combine compliant mechanisms (CMs) with tensioning cables to create dynamically reconfigurable kinematic mechanisms. The devices’ kinematics (DOFs) is enabled and determined by the layout of bendable rods. The additional cables function as on-demand motion constraints that can dynamically lock or unlock the mechanism's DOFs as they are tightened or loosened. We provide algorithms and a design tool prototype to help users design such kinematic devices. We also demonstrate various HCI use cases including a kinematic haptic display, a haptic proxy, and a multimodal input device.\n",

      " There are many methods for projecting spherical maps onto the plane. Interactive versions of these projections allow the user to centre the region of interest. However, the effects of such interaction have not previously been evaluated. In a study with 120 participants we find interaction provides significantly more accurate area, direction and distance estimation in such projections. The surface of 3D sphere and torus topologies provides a continuous surface for uninterrupted network layout. But how best to project spherical network layouts to 2D screens has not been studied, nor have such spherical network projections been compared to torus projections. Using the most successful interactive sphere projections from our first study, we compare spherical, standard and toroidal layouts of networks for cluster and path following tasks with 96 participants, finding benefits for both spherical and toroidal layouts over standard network layouts in terms of accuracy for cluster understanding tasks. \n",

      "This workshop proposes a space for Latin American academics and activists engaging with data to think critically about the legitimacy and power dynamics of knowledge production. Given that most research on data, as well as its area of application, have focused on and is informed by the Global North, this workshop sets the spotlight on Latin America and places activist and academic knowledge on equal standing. The organisers are an interdisciplinary group of Latin American scholars and activists, women based in the North and the South, engaging with data across the borderlands of disciplines, practices, migrations, and languages. By hosting the workshop in Spanish (with English interpretation), the organisers aim to create a space where Latin American voices are heard and appreciated, without requiring English proficiency from speakers and participants. We invite the CHI community to cross the borders and join a different conversation, including panels and interactive sessions that will inspire — and challenge — current thinking around data and data practices.  Spanish Version: Este taller propone un espacio para que académicxs y activistas latinoamericanxs que trabajan con datos piensen críticamente en la legitimidad y las dinámicas de poder en la producción de conocimiento. Dado que la mayor parte de las investigaciones sobre datos, así como su área de aplicación, se ha centrado en el Norte Global y ha sido moldeada por éste, este taller pone el foco en América Latina y sitúa el conocimiento activista y académico en igualdad de condiciones. Las organizadoras son un grupo interdisciplinario de académicas y activistas latinoamericanas, con sede en el Norte y en el Sur, que trabajan con datos a través de las fronteras disciplinarias, las prácticas, las migraciones y los idiomas. Al organizar el taller en español (con interpretación en inglés), las organizadoras se proponen crear un espacio en el que se escuchen y aprecien las voces latinoamericanas, sin exigir a ponentes y participantes que dominen el inglés. Invitamos a la comunidad de CHI a cruzar las fronteras y unirse a una conversación diferente, incluyendo paneles y sesiones interactivas que inspirarán  — y desafiarán —  ideas en torno a los datos y las prácticas de datos. \n",
