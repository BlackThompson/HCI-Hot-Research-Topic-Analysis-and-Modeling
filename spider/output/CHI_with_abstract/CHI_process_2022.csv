Expectation vs. experience: Evaluating the usability of code generation tools powered by large language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519665,111,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10366304,"
 Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have made automatic code generation possible for real-world programming tasks in general-purpose programming languages such as Python. However, there are few human studies on the usability of these tools and how they fit the programming workflow. In this work, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 24 participants to understand how programmers use and perceive Copilot, a LLM-based code generation tool. We found that, while Copilot did not necessarily improve the task completion time or success rate, most participants preferred to use Copilot in daily programming tasks, since Copilot often provided a useful starting point and saved the effort of searching online. However, participants did face difficulties in understanding, editing, and debugging code snippets generated by Copilot, which significantly hindered their task-solving effectiveness. Finally, we highlighted several promising directions for improving the design of Copilot based on our observations and participants’ feedback.

Promptchainer: Chaining large language model prompts through visual programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519729,53,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06566,"
While LLMs have made it possible to rapidly prototype new ML functionalities, many real-world applications involve complex tasks that cannot be easily handled via a single run of an LLM. Recent work has found that chaining multiple LLM runs together (with the output of one step being the input to the next) can help users accomplish these more complex tasks, and in a way that is perceived to be more transparent and controllable. However, it remains unknown what users need when authoring their own LLM chains – a key step to lowering the barriers for non-AI-experts to prototype AI-infused applications. In this work, we explore the LLM chain authoring process. We find from pilot studies that users need support transforming data between steps of a chain, as well as debugging the chain at multiple granularities. To address these needs, we designed PromptChainer, an interactive interface for visually programming chains. Through case studies with four designers and developers, we show that PromptChainer supports building prototypes for a range of applications, and conclude with open questions on scaling chains to even more complex tasks, as well as supporting low-fi chain prototyping.

Promptmaker: Prompt-based prototyping with large language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503564,36,https://3dvar.com/Jiang2022PromptMaker.pdf,"
 Prototyping is notoriously difficult to do with machine learning (ML), but recent advances in large language models may lower the barriers to people prototyping with ML, through the use of natural language prompts. This case study reports on the real-world experiences of industry professionals (e.g. designers, program managers, front-end developers) prototyping new ML-powered feature ideas via prompt-based prototyping. Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness. Taken together, this case study provides important implications that lay the groundwork toward a new future of prototyping with ML.

Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI): beyond opening the black-box of AI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503727,22,http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume22hcxai.pdf,"
 Explainability of AI systems is crucial to hold them accountable because they are increasingly becoming consequential in our lives by powering high-stakes decisions in domains like healthcare and law. When it comes to Explainable AI (XAI), understanding who interacts with the black-box of AI is just as important as “opening” it, if not more. Yet the discourse of XAI has been predominantly centered around the black-box, suffering from deficiencies in meeting user needs and exacerbating issues of algorithmic opacity. To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. In this second CHI workshop on Human-centered XAI (HCXAI), we build on the success of the first installment from CHI 2021 to expand the conversation around XAI. We chart the domain and shape the HCXAI discourse with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of the second installment is to go beyond the black box and examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels. Encouraging holistic (historical, sociological, and technical) approaches, we put an emphasis on “operationalizing”, aiming to produce actionable frameworks, transferable evaluation methods, concrete design guidelines, and articulate a coordinated research agenda for XAI.

Towards understanding the dark patterns that steal our attention,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519829,21,https://scholar.archive.org/work/ykx6bzmdgvdazcbptd4epfe5di/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519829,"
 Contemporary digital services often adopt mechanisms, e.g., recommendations and infinite scrolling, that exploit users’ psychological vulnerabilities to maximize time spent and daily visits. While these attention-capture dark patterns might contribute to technology overuse and problematic behaviors, they are relatively underexplored in the literature. In this paper, we first provide a definition of what are attention-capture dark patterns based on a review of recent works on digital wellbeing and dark patterns. Then, we describe a set 5 of attention-capture dark patterns extracted from a 1-week-long auto-ethnography during which we self-monitored our mobile and web interactions with Facebook and YouTube. Finally, we report on an initial study (N = 7) that explores whether and how a widespread mechanism, i.e., social investment, influence usage and users’ perception of the Facebook website. We discuss the implications that our work may have on the design of technologies that better align with users’ digital wellbeing.

Coauthor: Designing a human-ai collaborative writing dataset for exploring language model capabilities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502030,100,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502030,"
Large language models (LMs) offer unprecedented language generation capabilities and exciting opportunities for interaction design. However, their highly context-dependent capabilities are difficult to grasp and are often subjectively interpreted. In this paper, we argue that by curating and analyzing large interaction datasets, the HCI community can foster more incisive examinations of LMs’ generative capabilities. Exemplifying this approach, we present CoAuthor, a dataset designed for revealing GPT-3’s capabilities in assisting creative and argumentative writing. CoAuthor captures rich interactions between 63 writers and four instances of GPT-3 across 1445 writing sessions. We demonstrate that CoAuthor can address questions about GPT-3’s language, ideation, and collaboration capabilities, and reveal its contribution as a writing “collaborator” under various definitions of good collaboration. Finally, we discuss how this work may facilitate a more principled discussion around LMs’ promises and pitfalls in relation to interaction design. The dataset and an interface for replaying the writing sessions are publicly available at https://coauthor.stanford.edu.

 This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together.  It is time to convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.

Metaverse: the vision for the future,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516399,15,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRLJU7oaTsHTqY6xDqa5M1RHn3XyYHCv/view,"
 In recent years, the notion of the Metaverse has become the focus of a growing body of work in the industry. However, there is no consensus on the conceptualization in academia. To date, much of this attention has revolved around technological challenges. However, what is notably missing from these discussions is a consideration of the human factors and social aspects that are considered more critical challenges within HCI. The aims of this SIG are as follows: Firstly, to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to engage with the various definitions and the ways in which the Metaverse is developing. Secondly, to discuss the opportunities, challenges, and future possibilities in the context of HCI. This will lay the foundations to build a network for academics interested in the field for future multidisciplinary research relating to the Metaverse.

Dreaming disability justice in HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503731,12,https://disabilityjusticeinhci.org/assets/pdfs/chi22m-sub1216-cam-i31.pdf,"
 While disability studies and social justice-oriented research is growing in prominence in HCI, these approaches tend to only bring attention to oppression under a single identity axis (e.g. race-only, gender-only, disability-only, etc). Using a single-axis framework neglects to recognize people’s complex identities and how ableism overlaps with other forms of oppression including classism, racism, sexism, colonialism, among others. As a result, HCI and assistive technology research may not always attend to the complex lived experiences of disabled people. In this one-day workshop, we position disability justice as a framework that centers the needs and expertise of disabled people towards more equitable HCI and assistive technology research. We will discuss harmful biases in existing research and seek to distill strategies for researchers to better support disabled people in the design (and dismantling) of future technologies.

Understanding iOS privacy nutrition labels: An exploratory large-scale analysis of app store data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519739,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519739,"
Since December 2020, the Apple App Store has required all developers to create a privacy label when submitting new apps or app updates. However, there has not been a comprehensive study on how developers responded to this requirement. We present the first measurement study of Apple privacy nutrition labels to understand how apps on the U.S. App Store create and update privacy labels. We collected weekly snapshots of the privacy label and other metadata for all the 1.4 million apps on the U.S. App Store from April 2 to November 5, 2021. Our analysis showed that 51.6% of apps still do not have a privacy label as of November 5, 2021. Although 35.3% of old apps have created a privacy label, only 2.7% of old apps created a privacy label without app updates (i.e., voluntary adoption). Our findings suggest that inactive apps have little incentive to create privacy labels.

Exploring the effects of interactive dialogue in improving user control for explainable online symptom checkers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519668,8,https://scholar.archive.org/work/4vixjk5ferbmniw4b3frncb7iu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519668,"
 There has been a major push to improve the transparency of online symptom checkers (OSCs) by providing more explanations to users about their functioning and conclusions. However, not all users will want explanations about all aspects of these systems. A more user-centered approach is necessary for personalizing user experience of explanations. With this in mind, we designed and tested an interactive dialogue interface to afford user control to receive only those explanations that they would like to read. A user study (N = 152) with a text-based chatbot for assessing anxiety levels and presented explanations to participants in one of the three forms–an interactive dialogue providing choice for viewing different components of the explanations, a static disclosure of all explanations, and a control condition with no explanations whatsoever. We found that participants varied in the kinds of information they wanted to learn. The interactive delivery of explanations led to higher levels of perceived transparency and affective trust in the system. Furthermore, both subjective and objective understanding of the mechanism used for assessing anxiety was higher for participants in the interactive dialogue condition. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of imbuing interactivity for enhancing the effectiveness of explainable systems.

Social support in digital patronage: OnlyFans adult content creators as an online community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519836,12,https://scholar.archive.org/work/nqh6v7pszrcejh5mwknpam4bzy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519836,"
 OnlyFans is a digital patronage platform where independent creators provide exclusive content to their audiences for a monthly subscription fee. However, the platform affords creators limited resources to build their audiences, which is crucial to their success on the platform. Drawing on 15 semi-structured interviews with OnlyFans adult content creators, this study finds that creators must navigate the platform’s limitations through community building with fellow creators. Specifically, they engaged in computer-mediated communication with fellow creators to solicit, and provide, forms of social support. Our study thus sheds light on the social strategies that workers in the gig economy employ to overcome platform constraints.

Bridging the Gap between UX Practitioners' work practices and AI-enabled design support tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519809,8,https://yuwen.io/static/media/chi22extendedabstracts_394.fbb362f5c5d5940e5478.pdf,"
 User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design have become an indispensable part of today’s tech industry. Recently, much progress has been made in machine-learning-enabled design support tools for UX designers. However, few of these tools have been adopted by practitioners. To learn the underlying reasons and understand user needs for bridging this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis with 8 UX professionals to understand their practice and identify opportunities for future research. We found that the current AI-enabled systems to support UX work mainly work on graphical interface elements, while design activities that involve more ‘design thinking” such as user interviews and user testings are more helpful for designers. Many current systems were also designed for overly-simplistic and generic use scenarios. We identified 4 areas in the UX workflow that can benefit from additional AI-enabled assistance: design inspiration search, design alternative exploration, design system customization, and design guideline violation check.

Design guidelines for prompt engineering text-to-image generative models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501825,106,,"
 Text-to-image generative models are a new and powerful way to generate visual artwork. However, the open-ended nature of text as interaction is double-edged; while users can input anything and have access to an infinite range of generations, they also must engage in brute-force trial and error with the text prompt when the result quality is poor. We conduct a study exploring what prompt keywords and model hyperparameters can help produce coherent outputs. In particular, we study prompts structured to include subject and style keywords and investigate success and failure modes of these prompts. Our evaluation of 5493 generations over the course of five experiments spans 51 abstract and concrete subjects as well as 51 abstract and figurative styles. From this evaluation, we present design guidelines that can help people produce better outcomes from text-to-image generative models.

Stakeholders and Value in the NFT Ecosystem: Towards a Multi-disciplinary Understanding of the NFT Phenomenon,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519694,13,https://www.baytas.net/work/pub/2022_CHI_NFT.pdf,"
 Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been a defining trend for design, technology, and business in 2021. The value, legitimacy, and utility of NFTs is disputed: proponents highlight revolutionary economic and cultural potentials of an open, secure, and immutable ownership database, while opponents are displeased by the environmental issues and abundant wrongdoing in the ecosystem. Nevertheless, the phenomenon is relevant to HCI, and signifies important developments for future interactive products. To better understand the NFT phenomenon, and to inform future HCI research and design, we investigated the stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem and relations between them. Based on open data we mined from the social news website Hacker News, we contribute the first data-backed model of stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem. The model reveals a nuanced account of the outlooks of creators, owners, and technologists; identifies investment firms and auction houses as arbiters of knowledge and value; and presents implications for future research.

 The present case study examines the product landscape of current AI-empowered co-creative tools. Specifically, I review literature in both creativity and HCI research and investigate how these tools support different stages in humans’ creative processes and how common challenges in human-AI interaction (HAII) are addressed. I find these AI-driven tools mostly support the generation and execution of ideas and are less involved in the early stages of co-creation. Moreover, HAII challenges identified in other fields receive little attention in the creative domain. Based on a synthetic analysis, I elaborate on how future tools can leverage the ”non-human” quality of AI to achieve innovation through a more human-centered, collaborative journey.

Participatory design (PD) for Artificially Intelligent (AI) systems has gained in popularity in recent years across multiple application domains, both within the private and public sectors. PD methods broadly enable stakeholders of diverse backgrounds to inform new use cases for AI and the design of AI-based technologies that directly impact people's lives. Such participation can be vital for mitigating adverse implications of AI on society that are becoming increasingly apparent and pursuing more positive impact, especially to vulnerable populations. This panel brings together researchers who have, or are, conducting participatory design of AI systems across diverse subject areas. The goal of the panel is to elucidate similarities and differences, as well as successes and challenges, in how PD methods can be applied to Artificially Intelligent systems in practical and meaningful ways. The panel serves as an opportunity for the HCI research community to collectively reflect on opportunities for PD of AI to facilitate collaboration amongst stakeholders, as well as persistent challenges to participatory AI design.

 AI-powered technologies are increasingly being leveraged in health and care practices for aging populations. However, we lack research about older adults perceptions of AI-driven health in long-term care settings. This paper investigates older adults’ perceptions of how one AI-powered technology, voice assistants, should be used for personal health management. We interviewed 10 older adults living in an assisted living community in the U.S. to explore their values around AI for health. Findings show that they value technologies that generate and share positive and relational health information. We use this emphasis on positive health representations to speculate on a critical refusal of negative health representations. We highlight this preference in contrast to existing deficit-based health tracking technologies for aging and discuss how researchers, developers, and designers can engage in better approaches to AI-driven health for older adults and other historically marginalized populations.

 Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.

Whose labels should a machine learning (ML) algorithm learn to emulate? For ML tasks ranging from online comment toxicity to misinformation detection to medical diagnosis, different groups in society may have irreconcilable disagreements about ground truth labels. Supervised ML today resolves these label disagreements implicitly using majority vote, which overrides minority groups’ labels. We introduce jury learning, a supervised ML approach that resolves these disagreements explicitly through the metaphor of a jury: defining which people or groups, in what proportion, determine the classifier’s prediction. For example, a jury learning model for online toxicity might centrally feature women and Black jurors, who are commonly targets of online harassment. To enable jury learning, we contribute a deep learning architecture that models every annotator in a dataset, samples from annotators’ models to populate the jury, then runs inference to classify. Our architecture enables juries that dynamically adapt their composition, explore counterfactuals, and visualize dissent. A field evaluation finds that practitioners construct diverse juries that alter 14% of classification outcomes.

Informal caregivers disclose increasingly more to a social robot over time,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519666,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519666,"
 Informal caregivers often struggle in managing to cope with both the stress and the practical demands of the caregiving situation. It has been suggested that digital solutions might be useful to monitor caregivers’ health and well-being, by providing early intervention and support. Given the importance of self-disclosure for psychological health, here we aimed to investigate the potential of employing a social robot for eliciting self-disclosure among informal caregivers over time. We conducted a longitudinal experiment across a five-week period, measuring participants’ disclosure duration (in seconds) and length (in number of words). Our preliminary results show a positive trend where informal caregivers speak for a longer time and share more information in their disclosures to a social robot across the five-week period. These results provide useful evidence supporting the potential deployment of social robots as intervention tools to help provide support for individuals suffering from stress and experiencing challenging life situations.

Prescriptive and descriptive approaches to machine-learning transparency,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519724,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13582,"
 Specialized documentation techniques have been developed to communicate key facts about machine-learning (ML) systems and the datasets and models they rely on. Techniques such as Datasheets, FactSheets, and Model Cards have taken a mainly descriptive approach, providing various details about the system components. While the above information is essential for product developers and external experts to assess whether the ML system meets their requirements, other stakeholders might find it less actionable. In particular, ML engineers need guidance on how to mitigate potential shortcomings in order to fix bugs or improve the system’s performance. We survey approaches that aim to provide such guidance in a prescriptive way. We further propose a preliminary approach, called Method Cards, which aims to increase the transparency and reproducibility of ML systems by providing prescriptive documentation of commonly-used ML methods and techniques. We showcase our proposal with an example in small object detection, and demonstrate how Method Cards can communicate key considerations for model developers. We further highlight avenues for improving the user experience of ML engineers based on Method Cards.

 Gaming is a more accessible, engaging and popular past-time than ever before. Recent research highlights games as strikingly effective means of capturing and holding our attention — so effective, some argue, to the point of deleterious effect. An impassioned CHI2021 panel discussion directed these efforts towards the ethics and adoption of dark patterns. And yet, we know little as to how dark patterns are perceived and arise in the design, development and use of games. This paper seeks to address this knowledge gap by recounting findings from a design-led inquiry comprising interviews and workshops conducted with mobile game players, designers, developers, and business developers. We contribute an understanding of how dark patterns arise in the development, use and commercialisation of mobile games, their effects on players and industry professionals, and means for the consideration, negotiation and navigation of these strategies for gamer-engagement by design — in support of healthier, highly-engaging game experiences.

How to Train a (Bad) Algorithmic Caseworker: A Quantitative Deconstruction of Risk Assessments in Child Welfare,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519771,9,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05695,"
 Child welfare (CW) agencies use risk assessment tools as a means to achieve evidence-based, consistent, and unbiased decision-making. These risk assessments act as data collection mechanisms and have been further developed into algorithmic systems in recent years. Moreover, several of these algorithms have reinforced biased theoretical constructs and predictors because of the easy availability of structured assessment data. In this study, we critically examine the Washington Assessment of Risk Model (WARM), a prominent risk assessment tool that has been adopted by over 30 states in the United States and has been repurposed into more complex algorithmic systems. We compared WARM against the narrative coding of casenotes written by caseworkers who used WARM. We found significant discrepancies between the casenotes and WARM data where WARM scores did not not mirror caseworkers’ notes about family risk. We provide the SIGCHI community with some initial findings from the quantitative de-construction of a child-welfare risk assessment algorithm.

 As increasingly powerful natural language generation, representation, and understanding models are developed, made available and deployed across numerous downstream applications, many researchers and practitioners have warned about possible adverse impacts. Harmful impacts include but are not limited to disparities in quality-of-service, unequal distribution of resources, erasure, stereotyping and misrepresentation of groups and individuals, they might limit people’s agency or affect their well-being. Given that language tasks are often complex, open-ended, and incorporated across a diversity of applications; effectively foreseeing and mitigating such harms has remained an elusive goal. Towards this goal, Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature has only recently started to engage with human-centered perspectives and methods—that are often central to HCI research. In this panel, we bring together researchers with expertise in both NLP and HCI, as well as in issues that pertain to the fairness, transparency, justice, and ethics of computational systems. Our main goals are to explore 1) how to leverage HCI perspectives and methodologies to help foresee potential harms of language technologies and inform their mitigation, 2) synergies between the HCI and the responsible NLP research that can help build common ground, and 3) complement existing efforts to facilitate conversations between the HCI and NLP communities.

 Prospect theory is a behavioral model of how people make decisions in the presence of risk; this work explores the application of prospect theory, particularly the reference-dependence effect, to user interactions with cookie banners. We identify two possible risks associated with cookies—the functional risk that denying cookies will degrade user experience and the privacy risk that accepting cookies will allow a website to access and sell personal information—and explore how the slant of a cookie consent banner (which risk it emphasizes) and the framing of a banner (whether it emphasizes the potential for gain or the potential for loss) impact user decisions. We conduct an empirical users study (n = 1557) in which we observe how users interact with different cookie banner prompts. We find that for both possible slants, a negative framing is significantly more effective at nudging user decisions. We also find that the combination of slant and framing impact cookie opt-out rates by a factor of three. These results demonstrate the need for further consideration of the ethical implications of framing and nudging in the context of consent requests.

More than a bit of coding:(un-) Grounded (non-) Theory in HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516392,7,https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/36657/7/36657_COLE_More_than_a_bit_of_coding.pdf,"
 Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) is a powerful way to develop theories where there is little existing research using a flexible but rigorous empirically-based approach. Although it originates from the fields of social and health sciences, it is a field-agnostic methodology that can be used in any discipline. However, it tends to be misunderstood by researchers within HCI. This paper sets out to explain what GTM is, how it can be useful to HCI researchers, and examples of how it has been misapplied. There is an overview of the decades of methodological debate that surrounds GTM, why it’s important to be aware of this debate, and how GTM differs from other, better understood, qualitative methodologies. It is hoped the reader is left with a greater understanding of GTM, and better able to judge the results of research which claims to use GTM, but often does not.

Stickyland: Breaking the linear presentation of computational notebooks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519653,8,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11086,"
 How can we better organize code in computational notebooks? Notebooks have become a popular tool among data scientists, as they seamlessly weave text and code together, supporting users to rapidly iterate and document code experiments. However, it is often challenging to organize code in notebooks, partially because there is a mismatch between the linear presentation of code and the non-linear process of exploratory data analysis. We present StickyLand, a notebook extension for empowering users to freely organize their code in non-linear ways. With sticky cells that are always shown on the screen, users can quickly access their notes, instantly observe experiment results, and easily build interactive dashboards that support complex visual analytics. Case studies highlight how our tool can enhance notebook users’s productivity and identify opportunities for future notebook designs. StickyLand is available at https://github.com/xiaohk/stickyland.

A Speculative Ethics for Designing with Bodily Fluids,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516395,9,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1652016/FULLTEXT01.pdf,"
 This essay performs a speculative ethics in designing with a researcher’s own bodily fluids. This is through the creation of “performative texts”, which are autoethnographic accounts of past experiences in which written words perform through visual and spatial compositions alongside verbal readings aloud. I present three performative texts about moments of discomfort in designing with milk from my own breastfeeding relationship. They are to reflect upon felt experiences of potential harm and to understand social and material relations of care. From these I offer three possibilities for how HCI might consider the ethics of first-person research in attending to more-than-human entanglements: unsafe spaces, situated escapes, and censored inclusion. These possibilities and the approach of performative texts contribute to research for more sustainable futures by exploring the decentering of humans through an intimate engagement with the self.

A tale of two mice: Sustainable electronics design and prototyping,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519823,10,https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/Papers/biomouse-chi22.pdf,"
 Electronics have become integral to all aspects of life and form the physical foundation of computing; however electronic waste (e-waste) is among the fastest growing global waste streams and poses significant health and climate implications. We present a design guideline for sustainable electronics and use it to build a functional computer mouse with a biodegradable printed circuit board and case. We develop an end-to-end digital fabrication process using accessible maker tools to build circuits on biodegradable substrates that reduce embodied carbon and toxic waste. Our biodegradable circuit board sends data over USB at 800 kbps and generates 12 MHz signals without distortion. Our circuit board dissolves in water (in 5.5 min at 100 °C, 5 hrs at 20 °C) and we successfully recover and reuse two types of chips after dissolving. We also present an environmental assessment showing our design reduces the environmental carbon impact (kg CO2e) by 60.2% compared to a traditional mouse.

Feminist voices about ecological issues in HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503717,10,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10343288,"
 Even though issues such as climate change, pollution, and declining biodiversity impact us all, people with historically disenfranchised and socio-politically marginalized (HDSM) identities often bear the harsher brunt of ecological crises and suffer disproportionately. There is a need for listening to the voices of people with intersecting HDSM identities in relation to feminist engagements with ecological issues as applicable to HCI and IxD research and practice. Building upon and braiding together two thriving HCI discourses on feminism and environmental sustainability, we invite submissions from researchers, designers, educators, and activists interested in the intersections of feminist and ecological issues with a priority towards the well-being of people with HDSM identities. Converging feminist concerns on power, voice, and public discourse through this online workshop distributed across three time-zones, we hope to provide a forum for contemporary feminist voices as agents of change while engaging with ecological issues through an intersectional feminist orientation.

Empathy in design scale: development and initial insights,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519848,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519848,"
Empathy towards users is crucial to the design of user-centered technologies and services. Previous research focused on defining empathy and its role in the design process for triggering empathy for end-users. However, there is a lack of empathy measurement instruments in design. Most previous work focused on designers, overlooking the need for other stakeholders to develop empathy towards the users to break organizational silos and deliver high-quality user-centered services and products. In this contribution, we share the preliminary stages of the development of an empathy scale for service design. We build on empathy literature from psychology and design to define 18 items representing four empathy dimensions. We report on the definition of these dimensions and their underlying items, and present preliminary studies in which we reviewed the first version of the scale with experts and stakeholders.

"Trust in human-AI interaction: Scoping out models, measures, and methods",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519772,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519772,"
Trust has emerged as a key factor in people's interactions with AI-infused systems. Yet, little is known about what models of trust have been used and for what systems: robots, virtual characters, smart vehicles, decision aids, or others. Moreover, there is yet no known standard approach to measuring trust in AI. This scoping review maps out the state of affairs on trust in human-AI interaction (HAII) from the perspectives of models, measures, and methods. Findings suggest that trust is an important and multi-faceted topic of study within HAII contexts. However, most work is under-theorized and under-reported, generally not using established trust models and missing details about methods, especially Wizard of Oz. We offer several targets for systematic review work as well as a research agenda for combining the strengths and addressing the weaknesses of the current literature.

Physical Journey Maps: Staging Users' Experiences to Increase Stakeholders' Empathy towards Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519630,7,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/50542/2/3491101.3519630.pdf,"
Customer Journey Mapping is a widespread service design tool that synthesizes and communicates user research insights to stakeholders. In its common form, a journey map is a synthetic (typically non-interactive) visualization of the key steps of the users’ experience with a service or product. By decomposing the elements of a journey map and staging them under the form of a physical and interactive installation, we intend to leverage the power of journey mapping to break silos and prompt employees within an organization to discover end-users journeys in a compelling and empathic way. This aims to support the user-centered maturity of the organization by developing employees’ curiosity and empathy towards users. We illustrate this approach through a case study on railway passengers’ experiences. We explore the value of richer transfers of user research insights through physical journey maps and discuss design processes and mediums enabling journey maps to come to life.

Algorithmic management reimagined for workers and by workers: Centering worker well-being in gig work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501866,41,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501866,"
Prior research has studied the detrimental impact of algorithmic management on gig workers and strategies that workers devise in response. However, little work has investigated alternative platform designs to promote worker well-being, particularly from workers’ own perspectives. We use a participatory design approach wherein workers explore their algorithmic imaginaries to co-design interventions that center their lived experiences, preferences, and well-being in algorithmic management. Our interview and participatory design sessions highlight how various design dimensions of algorithmic management, including information asymmetries and unfair, manipulative incentives, hurt worker well-being. Workers generate designs to address these issues while considering competing interests of the platforms, customers, and themselves, such as information translucency, incentives co-configured by workers and platforms, worker-centered data-driven insights for well-being, and collective driver data sharing. Our work offers a case study that responds to a call for designing worker-centered digital work and contributes to emerging literature on algorithmic work.

Trauma-informed computing: Towards safer technology experiences for all,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517475,35,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10347453,"
Trauma is the physical, emotional, or psychological harm caused by deeply distressing experiences. Research with communities that may experience high rates of trauma has shown that digital technologies can create or exacerbate traumatic experiences. Via three vignettes, we discuss how considering the possible effects of trauma and traumatic stress reactions provides an explanatory lens with new insights into people’s technology experiences. Then, we present a framework—trauma-informed computing—in which we adapt and show how to apply six key principles of trauma-informed approaches to computing: safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, enablement, and intersectionality. Through specific examples, we describe how to apply trauma-informed computing in four areas of computing research and practice: user experience research & design, security & privacy, artificial intelligence & machine learning, and organizational culture in tech companies. We conclude by discussing how adopting trauma-informed computing will lead to benefits for all users, not only those experiencing trauma.

"“Alexa, do you want to build a snowman?” Characterizing playful requests to conversational agents",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519870,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519870,"
Conversational Agents (CAs) such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are well-suited for task-oriented interactions (“Call Jason”), but other interaction types are often beyond their capabilities. One notable example is playful requests: for example, people ask their CAs personal questions (“What’s your favorite color?”) or joke with them, sometimes at their expense (“Find Nemo”). Failing to recognize playfulness causes user dissatisfaction and abandonment, destroying the precious rapport with the CA.  Today, playful CA behavior is achieved through manually curated replies to hard-coded questions. We take a step towards understanding and scaling playfulness by characterizing playful opportunities. To map the problem’s landscape, we draw inspiration from humor theories and analyze real user data. We present a taxonomy of playful requests and explore its prevalence in real Alexa traffic. We hope to inspire new avenues towards more human-like CAs.

Habilyzer: Empowering Office Workers to Investigate their Working Habits using an Open-Ended Sensor Kit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519849,7,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/50537/1/chi22extendedabstracts-434%20%281%29_accessible%20version.pdf,"
Office work presents health and wellbeing challenges, triggered by unhealthy working habits or environmental factors. While technologies for vitality in the office context gain popularity, they are often solution-focused and fall short in acknowledging personal needs. Building on approaches from personal informatics, we see value in opening up the design space of tracking and sensing technologies for office workers. We designed and deployed an open-ended sensor kit and conducted two complementary studies to investigate the value of empowering office workers to investigate their own working habits. Findings show that Habilyzer triggers curiosity about working habits, and wireless sensors contribute to inquire into those habits, possibly supported by additional tools. We contribute new insights into how an open-ended sensor kit can be designed to support self-tracking practices and underlying reflections in the underexplored context of office work. It is an alternative approach to workplace vitality, moving from solution-oriented technologies to inquiry-enabling tools.

Advancing text generation algorithms (e.g., GPT-3) have led to new kinds of human-AI story co-creation tools. However, it is difficult for authors to guide this generation and understand the relationship between input controls and generated output. In response, we introduce TaleBrush, a GPT-based tool that uses abstract visualizations and sketched inputs. The tool allows writers to draw out the protagonist’s fortune with a simple and expressive interaction. The visualization of the fortune serves both as input control and representation of what the algorithm generated (a story with varying fortune levels). We hope this demonstration leads the community to consider novel controls and sensemaking interactions for human-AI co-creation.

Self-Determination Theory in HCI: Shaping a Research Agenda,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503702,8,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/181799/1/SDT_Workshop_CHI_2022_.pdf,"
 Self-determination theory (SDT) has become one of the most frequently used and well-validated theories used in HCI research, modelling the relation of basic psychological needs, intrinsic motivation, positive experience and wellbeing. This makes it a prime candidate for a ‘motor theme’ driving more integrated, systematic, theory-guided research. However, its use in HCI has remained superficial and disjointed across various application domains like games, health and wellbeing, or learning. This workshop therefore convenes researchers across HCI to co-create a research agenda on how SDT-informed HCI research can maximise its progress in the coming years.

Research Ethics in HCI: A SIGCHI Community Discussion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516400,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessica-Vitak-2/publication/360408357_Research_Ethics_in_HCI_A_SIGCHI_Community_Discussion/links/62791db43a23744a72704193/Research-Ethics-in-HCI-A-SIGCHI-Community-Discussion.pdf,"
 An ongoing challenge within the HCI community is coming to a shared understanding of research ethics in the face of our diverse disciplinary traditions, evolving technologies and methods, and multiple geographic and cultural settings. Building upon previous panels and town halls organized by the SIGCHI Research Ethics Committee at conferences including CSCW, CHI, GROUP, and IDC, this special interest group convening is intended to provide space for the broader HCI community to highlight, debate, and discuss current ethical challenges within our domain, and work toward the development of guidelines and processes for supporting–and evaluating– ethical research. For 2022, we are proposing a SIG rather than a more formal panel, to encourage more people who are not committee members to speak, share, and discuss their perspectives and challenges when engaging with research ethics in HCI. This conversation will benefit from a diversity of voices and perspectives to help us all learn from each other and think deeply and the values and ethical commitments of our research community.

 Since the COVID-19 pandemics, we have witnessed an increase in online worship services. Nevertheless, HCI has little insight into how technological mediation influences religious experiences and how technology should be designed for use in religious contexts. Therefore, we see a unique opportunity to understand better real-world experiences of technology use in religious rituals and, more specifically, in online worship services. Inspired by contextual design, We virtually observed and interviewed eight persons during and after participation in online worship services. We identified a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. The data suggests that current online worship service systems do not account for believers’ needs for community, faith, or extraordinariness. We discuss opportunities for future research and design, and aim to contribute to the understanding of online worship service experiences and the design of technology-mediated religious experiences.

 AI-based decision support tools (ADS) are increasingly used to augment human decision-making in high-stakes, social contexts. As public sector agencies begin to adopt ADS, it is critical that we understand workers’ experiences with these systems in practice. In this paper, we present findings from a series of interviews and contextual inquiries at a child welfare agency, to understand how they currently make AI-assisted child maltreatment screening decisions. Overall, we observe how workers’ reliance upon the ADS is guided by (1) their knowledge of rich, contextual information beyond what the AI model captures, (2) their beliefs about the ADS’s capabilities and limitations relative to their own, (3) organizational pressures and incentives around the use of the ADS, and (4) awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and their own decision-making objectives. Drawing upon these findings, we discuss design implications towards supporting more effective human-AI decision-making.

Augmented reality and robotics: A survey and taxonomy for ar-enhanced human-robot interaction and robotic interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517719,39,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03254,"
 This paper contributes to a taxonomy of augmented reality and robotics based on a survey of 460 research papers. Augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) have emerged as a new way to enhance human-robot interaction (HRI) and robotic interfaces (e.g., actuated and shape-changing interfaces). Recently, an increasing number of studies in HCI, HRI, and robotics have demonstrated how AR enables better interactions between people and robots. However, often research remains focused on individual explorations and key design strategies, and research questions are rarely analyzed systematically. In this paper, we synthesize and categorize this research field in the following dimensions: 1) approaches to augmenting reality; 2) characteristics of robots; 3) purposes and benefits; 4) classification of presented information; 5) design components and strategies for visual augmentation; 6) interaction techniques and modalities; 7) application domains; and 8) evaluation strategies. We formulate key challenges and opportunities to guide and inform future research in AR and robotics.

Emotion has been studied in HCI for two decades, with specific traditions interested in sensing, expressing, transmitting, modelling, experiencing, visualizing, understanding, constructing, regulating, manipulating or adapting to emotion in human-human and human-computer interactions. This CHI 2022 workshop on the Future of Emotion in Human-Computer Interaction brings together interested researchers to take stock of research on emotion in HCI to-date and to explore possible futures. Through group discussion and collaborative speculation we will address questions such as: What are the relationships between digital technology and human emotion? What roles does emotion play in HCI research? How should HCI researchers conceptualize emotion? When should HCI researchers use interdisciplinary theories of emotion or create new theory? Can specific emotions be designed for, and where is this knowledge likely to be applied? What are the implications of emotion research for design, ethics and wellbeing? What is the future of emotion in human-computer interaction?

Fear of missing out (FoMO) refers to one's perception that others live a better life as well as one's desire to keep constantly linked to what others are doing via social media. Our study aims to develop an emotion awareness intervention based on the Satir Model to help people become more aware of their emotions after using Instagram through a set of reflection questions and guiding prompts. We designed and built a web-based application called Being to deliver these content in a 10-day field study. Our findings suggested that participants generally found the reflection questions helped them better perceive how they use Instagram in terms of their use habits and mental states. The combination of reflection questions and guiding prompts helped improve participants’ emotion regulation skills and enabled them to develop strategies of using less Instagram. We conclude by discussing implications for future researchers interested in developing similar interventions.

 Immersive Analytics is now a fully emerged research topic that spans several research communities, including Human-Computer Interaction, Data Visualisation, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Immersive Analytics research has identified and validated benefits of using embodied, 3D spatial immersive environments for visualisation and have shown benefits in the effective use of space and 3D interaction to explore complex data. As of today, most studies in Immersive Analytics have focused on exploring novel visualisation techniques in 3D embodied immersive environments. Thus far, there is a lack of fundamental study in this field that clearly compares immersive versus non immersive platforms for analytics purposes, and firmly delineates the benefits of immersive environments for analytic tasks. We feel that it is time to establish an agenda to assess the benefits and potential of immersive technologies, spatial interfaces, and embodied interaction to support sensemaking, data understanding, and collaborative analytics. This workshop will aim at putting this agenda together, by gathering international experts from Immersive Analytics and related fields to define which studies need to be conducted to assess the effect of embodied interaction on cognition in data analytics.

Human-ai collaboration via conditional delegation: A case study of content moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501999,36,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501999,"
Despite impressive performance in many benchmark datasets, AI models can still make mistakes, especially among out-of-distribution examples. It remains an open question how such imperfect models can be used effectively in collaboration with humans. Prior work has focused on AI assistance that helps people make individual high-stakes decisions, which is not scalable for a large amount of relatively low-stakes decisions, e.g., moderating social media comments. Instead, we propose conditional delegation as an alternative paradigm for human-AI collaboration where humans create rules to indicate trustworthy regions of a model. Using content moderation as a testbed, we develop novel interfaces to assist humans in creating conditional delegation rules and conduct a randomized experiment with two datasets to simulate in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our study demonstrates the promise of conditional delegation in improving model performance and provides insights into design for this novel paradigm, including the effect of AI explanations.

 HCI scholarship has not yet fully engaged with faith, religion, and spirituality, even though billions of people around the world are associated with such traditions and belief systems. While a few papers and workshops at CHI have focused on particular religions, broader discussions around religion, interfaith relationships, and computing have been absent from mainstream HCI design concerns. In this workshop, we propose to bring together HCI scholars and practitioners, whose work is associated with various faiths, religions, and spiritual practices to start this important conversation, with a focus on three questions: (a) does secularization in computing marginalize faith-based values? and if so, how? (b) how can HCI design address the unique needs and values of faith-based communities? and (c) how can scholarship and practice in HCI benefit from the integration of faith, religion, and spirituality? We hope to form an HCI community of scholars and practitioners focused on the intersection of faith/spirituality/religion and computing.

How child welfare workers reduce racial disparities in algorithmic decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501831,28,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501831,"
 Machine learning tools have been deployed in various contexts to support human decision-making, in the hope that human-algorithm collaboration can improve decision quality. However, the question of whether such collaborations reduce or exacerbate biases in decision-making remains underexplored. In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study, analyzing child welfare call screen workers’ decision-making over a span of four years, and interviewing them on how they incorporate algorithmic predictions into their decision-making process. Our data analysis shows that, compared to the algorithm alone, workers reduced the disparity in screen-in rate between Black and white children from 20% to 9%. Our qualitative data show that workers achieved this by making holistic risk assessments and adjusting for the algorithm’s limitations. Our analyses also show more nuanced results about how human-algorithm collaboration affects prediction accuracy, and how to measure these effects. These results shed light on potential mechanisms for improving human-algorithm collaboration in high-risk decision-making contexts.

Using Virtual Reality to Design and Evaluate a Lunar Lander: The EL3 Case Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519775,6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13941,"
 The European Large Logistics Lander (EL3) is being designed to carry out cargo delivery missions in support of future lunar ground crews. The capacity of virtual reality (VR) to visualize and interactively simulate the unique lunar environment makes it a potentially powerful design tool during the early development stages of EL3, as well as other relevant technologies. Based on input from the EL3 development team, we have produced a VR-based operational scenario featuring a hypothetical configuration of the lander. Relying on HCI research methods, we have subsequently evaluated this scenario with relevant experts (n=10). Qualitative findings from this initial pilot study have demonstrated the usefulness of VR as a design tool in this context, but likewise surfaced a number of limitations in the form of potentially impaired validity and generalizability. We conclude by outlining our future research plan and reflect on the potential use of physical stimuli to improve the validity of VR-based simulations in forthcoming design activities.

Birds of a feather don't fact-check each other: Partisanship and the evaluation of news in Twitter's Birdwatch crowdsourced fact-checking program,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502040,36,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502040,"
 There is a great deal of interest in the role that partisanship, and cross-party animosity in particular, plays in interactions on social media. Most prior research, however, must infer users’ judgments of others’ posts from engagement data. Here, we leverage data from Birdwatch, Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking pilot program, to directly measure judgments of whether other users’ tweets are misleading, and whether other users’ free-text evaluations of third-party tweets are helpful. For both sets of judgments, we find that contextual features – in particular, the partisanship of the users – are far more predictive of judgments than the content of the tweets and evaluations themselves. Specifically, users are more likely to write negative evaluations of tweets from counter-partisans; and are more likely to rate evaluations from counter-partisans as unhelpful. Our findings provide clear evidence that Birdwatch users preferentially challenge content from those with whom they disagree politically. While not necessarily indicating that Birdwatch is ineffective for identifying misleading content, these results demonstrate the important role that partisanship can play in content evaluation. Platform designers must consider the ramifications of partisanship when implementing crowdsourcing programs.

ONYX-User Interfaces for Assisting in Interactive Task Learning for Natural Language Interfaces of Data Visualization Tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519793,6,,"
 While natural language interfaces (NLIs) are increasingly utilized to simplify the interaction with data visualization tools, improving and adapting the NLIs to the individual needs of users still requires the support of developers. ONYX introduces an interactive task learning (ITL) based approach which enables NLIs to learn from users through natural interactions. Users can personalize the NLI with new commands using direct manipulation, known commands, or by combining both. To further support users during the training process, we derived two design goals for the user interface, namely providing suggestions based on sub-parts of the command and addressing ambiguities through follow-up questions and instantiated them in ONYX. In order to trigger reflections and gain feedback on possible design trade-offs of ONYX and the instantiated design goals, we performed a formative user study to understand how to successfully integrate the suggestions and follow-up question into the interaction.

Attitudes towards Online Community Support Initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Survey in the UK,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519830,13,https://oro.open.ac.uk/83039/1/chi22extendedabstracts-415.pdf,"
The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed unexpected hardship on the health, environment, economic, and social-political governance of the entire human population. Local communities have adopted new ways of communicating and connecting to support each other. This paper reports people's attitudes towards online community support initiatives (OCSIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a survey conducted in the UK. Our analysis of responses from 699 participants suggests the increased use of social media sites and OCSI engagement since the pandemic, and that people had positive attitudes towards the OCSIs, but improvements were still required. We suggest four design implications to alleviate the challenges of using OCSIs.

Unmaking@ CHI: Concretizing the material and epistemological practices of unmaking in hci,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503721,7,https://kwsong.github.io/assets/pdf/publications/Sabie-unmakingws.pdf,"
 Design is conventionally considered to be about making and creating new things. But what about the converse of that process – unmaking that which already exists? Researchers and designers have recently started to explore the concept of “unmaking” to actively think about important design issues like reuse, repair, and unintended socio-ecological impacts. They have also observed the importance of unmaking as a ubiquitous process in the world, and its relation to making in an ongoing dialectic that continually recreates our material and technological realms. Despite the increasing attention to unmaking, it remains largely under-investigated and under-theorized in HCI. The objectives of this workshop are therefore to (a) bring together a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in exploring or showcasing the affordances of unmaking, (b) articulate the material and epistemological scopes of unmaking within HCI, and (c) reflect on frameworks, research approaches, and technical infrastructure for unmaking in HCI that can support its wider application in the field.

Understanding the impact of explanations on advice-taking: a user study for AI-based clinical Decision Support Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502104,34,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502104,"
The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focuses on providing explanations for AI systems’ decisions. XAI applications to AI-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS) should increase trust in the DSS by allowing clinicians to investigate the reasons behind its suggestions. In this paper, we present the results of a user study on the impact of advice from a clinical DSS on healthcare providers’ judgment in two different cases: the case where the clinical DSS explains its suggestion and the case it does not. We examined the weight of advice, the behavioral intention to use the system, and the perceptions with quantitative and qualitative measures. Our results indicate a more significant impact of advice when an explanation for the DSS decision is provided. Additionally, through the open-ended questions, we provide some insights on how to improve the explanations in the diagnosis forecasts for healthcare assistants, nurses, and doctors.

Toward User-Driven Algorithm Auditing: Investigating users' strategies for uncovering harmful algorithmic behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517441,26,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517441,"
 Recent work in HCI suggests that users can be powerful in surfacing harmful algorithmic behaviors that formal auditing approaches fail to detect. However, it is not well understood how users are often able to be so effective, nor how we might support more effective user-driven auditing. To investigate, we conducted a series of think-aloud interviews, diary studies, and workshops, exploring how users find and make sense of harmful behaviors in algorithmic systems, both individually and collectively. Based on our findings, we present a process model capturing the dynamics of and influences on users’ search and sensemaking behaviors. We find that 1) users’ search strategies and interpretations are heavily guided by their personal experiences with and exposures to societal bias; and 2) collective sensemaking amongst multiple users is invaluable in user-driven algorithm audits. We offer directions for the design of future methods and tools that can better support user-driven auditing.

TaleBrush: Sketching stories with generative pretrained language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501819,56,,"
While advanced text generation algorithms (e.g., GPT-3) have enabled writers to co-create stories with an AI, guiding the narrative remains a challenge. Existing systems often leverage simple turn-taking between the writer and the AI in story development. However, writers remain unsupported in intuitively understanding the AI’s actions or steering the iterative generation. We introduce TaleBrush, a generative story ideation tool that uses line sketching interactions with a GPT-based language model for control and sensemaking of a protagonist’s fortune in co-created stories. Our empirical evaluation found our pipeline reliably controls story generation while maintaining the novelty of generated sentences. In a user study with 14 participants with diverse writing experiences, we found participants successfully leveraged sketching to iteratively explore and write stories according to their intentions about the character’s fortune while taking inspiration from generated stories. We conclude with a reflection on how sketching interactions can facilitate the iterative human-AI co-creation process.

Crowdworkers' temporal flexibility is being traded for the convenience of requesters through 19 'invisible mechanisms' employed by crowdworking platforms: A …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519629,6,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10147585/1/crowd-flexibility.pdf,"
Crowdworking platforms are a prime example of a product that sells flexibility to its consumers. In this paper, we argue that crowdworking platforms sell temporal flexibility to requesters to the detriment of workers. We begin by identifying a list of 19 features employed by crowdworking platforms that facilitate the trade of temporal flexibility from crowdworkers to requesters. Using the list of features, we conduct a comparative analysis of nine crowdworking platforms available to U.S.-based workers, in which we describe key differences and similarities between the platforms. We find that crowdworking platforms strongly favour features that promote requesters’ temporal flexibility over workers’ by limiting the predictability of workers’ working hours and restricting paid time. Further, we identify which platforms employ the highest number of features that facilitate the trade of temporal flexibility from workers to requesters, consequently increasing workers’ temporal precarity. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of the results.

Mine yourself!: A role-playing privacy tutorial in virtual reality environment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519773,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519773,"
 Virtual Reality (VR) has potential vulnerabilities in privacy risks from collecting a wide range of data with higher density. Various designs to provide information on Privacy Policy (PP) have improved the awareness and motivation towards privacy risks. However, most of them have focused on desktop environments, not utilizing the full potential of VR’s immersive interactivity. Therefore, we proposed a role-playing mechanism to provide an immersive experience of interacting with PP’s key entities. First, our formative study found insights for PP where VR users had limited awareness of what data to be collected and how to control them. Following this, we implemented a VR privacy tutorial based on our role-playing mechanism and PP from off-the-shelf VR devices. Our privacy tutorial increased a similar amount of privacy awareness with significantly higher satisfaction (p=0.007) than conventional PP. Our tutorial also showed marginally higher usability (p=0.11).

When confidence meets accuracy: Exploring the effects of multiple performance indicators on trust in machine learning models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501967,27,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501967,"
 Previous research shows that laypeople’s trust in a machine learning model can be affected by both performance measurements of the model on the aggregate level and performance estimates on individual predictions. However, it is unclear how people would trust the model when multiple performance indicators are presented at the same time. We conduct an exploratory human-subject experiment to answer this question. We find that while the level of model confidence significantly affects people’s belief in model accuracy, both the model’s stated and observed accuracy generally have a larger impact on people’s willingness to follow the model’s predictions as well as their self-reported levels of trust in the model, especially after observing the model’s performance in practice. We hope the empirical evidence reported in this work could open doors to further studies to advance understanding of how people perceive, process, and react to performance-related information of machine learning.

Actuated Materials and Soft Robotics Strategies for Human-Computer Interaction Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503711,8,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146389/3491101.3503711.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
 The fields of programmable matter, actuated materials, and Soft Robotics are becoming increasingly more relevant for the design of novel applications, interfaces, and user experiences in the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). These research fields often use soft, flexible materials with elastic actuation mechanisms to build systems that are more adaptable, compliant, and suitable for a very broad range of environments. However, at the intersection between HCI and the aforementioned domains, there are numerous challenges related to fabrication methods, development tools, resource availability, nomenclature, design for inclusion, etc. This workshop aims to explore how to make Soft Robotics more accessible to both researchers and nonresearchers alike. We will (1) investigate and identify the various difficulties people face when developing HCI applications that require the transfer of knowledge from those other domains, and (2) discuss possible solutions and visions on how to overcome those difficulties.

Investigating Data Work Across Domains: New Perspectives on the Work of Creating Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503724,5,https://www.alexlu.me/s/pine-chi22.pdf,"
In the wake of the hype around big data, artificial intelligence, and “data-drivenness,” much attention has been paid to developing novel tools to capitalize upon the deluge of data being recorded and gathered automatically through IT systems. While much of this literature tends to overlook the data itself—sometimes even characterizing it as “data exhaust” that is readily available to be fed into algorithms, which will unlock the insights held within it—a growing body of literature has recently been directed at the (often intensive and skillful) work that goes into creating, collecting, managing, curating, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating data. These investigations detail the practices and processes involved in making data useful and meaningful so that aims of becoming ‘data-driven’ or ‘data-informed’ can become real. Further, In some cases, increased demands for data work have led to the formation of new occupations, whereas at other times data work has been added to the task portfolios of existing occupations and professions, occasionally affecting their core identity. Thus, the evolving forms of data work are requiring individual and organizational resources, new and re-tooled practices and tools, development of new competences and skills, and creation of new functions and roles. While differences exist across the global North and the global South experience of data work, such factors of data production remain paramount even as they exist largely for the benefit of the data-driven system [21, 32]. This one-day workshop will investigate existing and emerging tasks of data work. Further, participants will seek to understand data work as it impacts: individual data workers; occupations tasked with data work (existing and emerging); organizations (e.g. changing their skill-mix and infrastructuring to support data work); and teaching institutions (grappling with incorporation of data work into educational programs). Participants are required to submit a position paper or a case study drawn from their research to be reviewed and accepted by the organizing committee (submissions should be up to four pages in length). Upon acceptance, participants will read each other's paper, prepare to shortly present and respond to comments by two discussants and other participants. Subsequently, the workshop will focus on developing a set of core processes and tasks as well as an outline of a research agenda for a CHI-perspective on data work in the coming years.

Towards relatable explainable AI with the perceptual process,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501826,33,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501826,"
 Machine learning models need to provide contrastive explanations, since people often seek to understand why a puzzling prediction occurred instead of some expected outcome. Current contrastive explanations are rudimentary comparisons between examples or raw features, which remain difficult to interpret, since they lack semantic meaning. We argue that explanations must be more relatable to other concepts, hypotheticals, and associations. Inspired by the perceptual process from cognitive psychology, we propose the XAI Perceptual Processing Framework and RexNet model for relatable explainable AI with Contrastive Saliency, Counterfactual Synthetic, and Contrastive Cues explanations. We investigated the application of vocal emotion recognition, and implemented a modular multi-task deep neural network to predict and explain emotions from speech. From think-aloud and controlled studies, we found that counterfactual explanations were useful and further enhanced with semantic cues, but not saliency explanations. This work provides insights into providing and evaluating relatable contrastive explainable AI for perception applications.

Nice is different than good: Longitudinal communicative effects of realistic and cartoon avatars in real mixed reality work meetings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519628,5,https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/31756/1/Nice%20is%20Different%20than%20Good%20CHILBW2022.pdf,"
We report a within-subjects study of the effect of realistic and cartoon avatars on communication, task satisfaction, and perceived sense of presence in mixed reality meetings. For 2 − 3 weeks, six groups of co-workers (14 people) held a recurring real work meeting using Microsoft HoloLens2 devices. Each person embodied a personalised full-body avatar with a realistic face and another with a cartoon face. Half the groups started in the realistic condition and the other half started in the cartoon condition; all groups switched conditions half-way. Initial results show that, overall, participants found the realistic avatars’ nonverbal behaviour more appropriate for the interaction and more useful for understanding their colleagues compared to the cartoon one. Regarding the results over time, we identify different insights for cartoon and realistic avatars based on the type of avatar was embodied first. We discuss the implications of these results for mixed and virtual reality meetings.

Open5x: Accessible 5-axis 3D printing and conformal slicing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519782,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11426,"
The common layer-by-layer deposition of regular, 3-axis 3D printing simplifies both the fabrication process and the 3D printer’s mechanical design. However, the resulting 3D printed objects have some unfavourable characteristics including visible layers, uneven structural strength and support material. To overcome these, researchers have employed robotic arms and multi-axis CNCs to deposit materials in conformal layers. Conformal deposition improves the quality of the 3D printed parts through support-less printing and curved layer deposition. However, such multi-axis 3D printing is inaccessible to many individuals due to high costs and technical complexities. Furthermore, the limited GUI support for conformal slicers creates an additional barrier for users. To open multi-axis 3D printing up to more makers and researchers, we present a cheap and accessible way to upgrade a regular 3D printer to 5 axes. We have also developed a GUI-based conformal slicer, integrated within a popular CAD package. Together, these deliver an accessible workflow for designing, simulating and creating conformally-printed 3D models.

Validity of the open card sorting method for producing website information structures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519734,6,,"
When it comes to creating website information structures, open card sorting is the main approach used. However, scientific research for the method's validity is lacking. This paper explores the validity of open card sorting for website structural design. To this end, participants first performed an open card sort for the redesign of a website with usability issues in its information structure. Next, a within-subjects user testing study was performed to compare two functional prototypes that differed only in their structure: one replicated the existing website structure, whereas the other implemented the structure produced by card sort data analysis. Results showed that participants using the redesigned structure had significantly better usability metrics (first click success rate, task time, SEQ score and SUS score) compared to when interacting with the existing structure. These findings provide support for the validity of the open card sorting method for the design of website information structures.

The dark side of perceptual manipulations in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517728,31,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13200,"
“Virtual-Physical Perceptual Manipulations” (VPPMs) such as redirected walking and haptics expand the user’s capacity to interact with Virtual Reality (VR) beyond what would ordinarily physically be possible. VPPMs leverage knowledge of the limits of human perception to effect changes in the user’s physical movements, becoming able to (perceptibly and imperceptibly) nudge their physical actions to enhance interactivity in VR. We explore the risks posed by the malicious use of VPPMs. First, we define, conceptualize and demonstrate the existence of VPPMs. Next, using speculative design workshops, we explore and characterize the threats/risks posed, proposing mitigations and preventative recommendations against the malicious use of VPPMs. Finally, we implement two sample applications to demonstrate how existing VPPMs could be trivially subverted to create the potential for physical harm. This paper aims to raise awareness that the current way we apply and publish VPPMs can lead to malicious exploits of our perceptual vulnerabilities.

 We revisit the foundational principles of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Augmented Reality (AR) environments to discuss the perspective that AmI and AR feature the same vision of computing, as intuited at their origins, despite their recent development into what may appear as two distinct areas of scientific investigation. We focus on three concepts core to both AmI and AR, on which we capitalize to argue that a significant philosophical overlap exists between their visions: (1) the concept of an environment that undergoes a form of augmentation, (2) the indispensable process of an integration involving the environment, and (3) the emergence of a specific form of media congruent with the characteristics of the environment in which they are created, transmitted, and consumed. We draw implications for the science and practice of Human-Computer Interaction regarding new interactive environments enabled by the technologies of AmI and AR used conjointly.

 Interfaces for machine learning (ML), information and visualizations about models or data, can help practitioners build robust and responsible ML systems. Despite their benefits, recent studies of ML teams and our interviews with practitioners (n=9) showed that ML interfaces have limited adoption in practice. While existing ML interfaces are effective for specific tasks, they are not designed to be reused, explored, and shared by multiple stakeholders in cross-functional teams. To enable analysis and communication between different ML practitioners, we designed and implemented Symphony, a framework for composing interactive ML interfaces with task-specific, data-driven components that can be used across platforms such as computational notebooks and web dashboards. We developed Symphony through participatory design sessions with 10 teams (n=31), and discuss our findings from deploying Symphony to 3 production ML projects at Apple. Symphony helped ML practitioners discover previously unknown issues like data duplicates and blind spots in models while enabling them to share insights with other stakeholders.

Despite its benefits for children’s skill development and parent-child bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy’s design highlighted the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy’s usability and suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.

Ukemochi: A Video See-through Food Overlay System for Eating Experience in the Metaverse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519779,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491101.3519779,"
 The widespread use of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) allows ordinary users to interact with their friends daily in social Virtual Environments (VEs) or metaverse. However, it is not easy to eat in a metaverse while wearing an HMD because the Real Environment (RE) is not visible. Currently, users watch the RE’s food through the gap between the user’s face and the HMD (None) or superimposing a video see-through (VST) image on the VE, but these methods reduce the sense of presence. To allow natural eating in a VE, we propose Ukemochi that improves the presence and ease of eating. Ukemochi seamlessly overlays a food segmentation image inferred by deep neural networks on a VE. Ukemochi can be used simultaneously as a VE created with the OpenVR API and can be easily deployed for the metaverse. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of Ukemochi by comparing three visual presentation methods (None, VST, and Ukemochi) and two meal conditions (Hand condition and Plate condition). The experimental results demonstrated that Ukemochi enables users to maintain a high presence in VE and improve the ease of eating. We believe that our study will provide users with the experience of eating in the metaverse and encourage further research on eating in the metaverse.

 Is our future heading towards enhancing the human experience with computer-mediated reality? Immersive technology is unique, existing between the world and our senses, letting users traverse wholly virtual environments (i.e. distant places or fantasy worlds) or augment the real world with virtual objects, and any mix of virtuality-reality in-between. This paper explores the philosophical and social ramifications of ubiquitous immersive technology, envisioning a relatively near-future where mainstream technology has been replaced and a dystopian far-future wherein individuals may choose to abandon reality in favour of virtual worlds. Creating design fictions as thought experiments, we explore the open challenges of possible futures in XR, researching tomorrow’s technologies today.

 The intertwined and sometimes contradictory work of managing complex health needs (e.g., discordant, enigmatic, and/or rare conditions) creates many challenges for patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. While researchers have created interventions such as technologies and services to address particular health needs, interventions must be designed to better account for gaps in technologies and interdependencies across health needs. In this workshop we will adopt an ecosystems perspective to better understand the nature of complex needs and how to support the management of those needs through holistic and multi-faceted support. Using a hands-on design sprint technique, participants will (1) map out different complex care ecosystems, (2) generate ideas for technologies, services, and other multi-faceted interventions to address gaps in those ecosystems, and (3) choose the most promising ideas to further develop and refine. We will close by reflecting together on what we have created, our approaches to design, and the theories and concepts that shaped our approaches. Through this process, we will collectively generate an agenda for research and design to better support the management of complex health needs.

Field workers, like farmers and radiologists, play a crucial role in dataset collection for AI models in low-resource settings. However, we know little about how field workers’ expertise is leveraged in dataset and model development. Based on 68 interviews with AI developers building for low-resource contexts, we find that developers reduced field workers to data collectors. Attributing poor data quality to worker practices, developers conceived of workers as corrupt, lazy, non-compliant, and as datasets themselves, pursuing surveillance and gamification to discipline workers to collect better quality data. Even though models sought to emulate the expertise of field workers, AI developers treated workers as non-essential and deskilled their expertise in service of building machine intelligence. We make the case for why field workers should be recognised as domain experts and re-imagine domain expertise as an essential partnership for AI development.

 Autonomous cars offer passengers a rich platform for Augmented Reality entertainment, with complex sensing that can drive passenger experiences by tracking, appropriating and altering elements of reality. This paper forms an early exploration of in-car AR games, starting with how existing game genres might work within an AR vehicle context, appropriating elements of reality (e.g. other cars) into gameplay, and altering the appearance of reality in relation to game events (e.g. augmented cracks in car windows). We discuss results from focus groups exploring an initial AR game prototype, and an informal in-car evaluation of a follow-up prototype inspired by the focus groups. Broadly, we found that participants enjoyed using AR gaming in-car, noted the immersive impact of appropriating real-world elements into gameplay, and felt that it improved their experience of the journey. We reflect on the ways in which future AR passenger experiences might take advantage of the available sensing and environment to create engaging reality-based gameplay.

 Automated vehicles are expected to substitute driver-pedestrian communication via LED strips or displays. This communication is expected to improve trust and the crossing process in general. However, numerous factors such as other pedestrians’ behavior, perceived time pressure, or previous experience influence crossing decisions. Therefore, we report the results of a triply subdivided Virtual Reality study (N=18) evaluating these. Results show that external communication was perceived as hedonically pleasing, increased perceived safety and trust, and also that pedestrians’ behavior affected participants’ behavior. A timer did not alter crossing behavior, however, repeated exposure increased trust and reduced crossing times, showing a habituation effect. Our work helps better to integrate research on external communication in ecologically valid settings.

Exploring discrete drawing guides to assist users in accurate mid-air sketching in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519737,4,https://www.mayradonaji.net/files/EyesSketching_CHI22_LBW.pdf,"
 Even though VR design applications that support sketching are popular, sketching accurately in mid-air is challenging for users. In this paper, we explore discrete visual guides that assist users’ stroke accuracy and drawing experience inside the virtual environment. We also present an eye-tracking study that compares continuous, discrete, and no guide in a basic drawing task. Our experiment asks participants to draw a circle and a line using three different guide types, three different sizes and two different orientations. Results indicate that discrete guides are more user-friendly than continuous guides, as the majority of participants preferred their use, while we found no difference in speed/accuracy compared to continuous guides. Potentially, this can be attributed to distinct eye-gaze strategies, as discrete guides led users to shift their eyes more frequently between guide points and the drawing cursor. Our insights are useful for practitioners and researchers in 3D sketching, as they are a first step to inform future design applications of how visual guides inside the virtual environment affect visual behaviour and how eye-gaze can become a tool to assist sketching.

Recognizing the significant potential impact that HCI has on food practices and experiences, researchers and practitioners are undertaking a growing number of explorations of novel computing technology and food combinations. These explorations have so far primarily emphasized technology-driven systems and taken a human-centric perspective. We propose a Special Interest Group (SIG) in “foodHCI futures” that creates a space for researchers to discuss the boundaries of food incorporating HCI, and with the simultaneous aims of reconciling food with technology and extending our visions for human-food interactions towards anthropocentrism. Specifically, the SIG will be a beginning of developing a structured conceptual map of the possibilities for future technology interventions in food systems. In developing this map, we hope to encourage democratized debate, provoke new and divergent thoughts on the opportunities for foodHCI, and ultimately gain unique insights that contribute to preferable food futures.

"“Okay, whatever”: An Evaluation of Cookie Consent Interfaces",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501985,29,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501985,"
 Many websites have added cookie consent interfaces to meet regulatory consent requirements. While prior work has demonstrated that they often use dark patterns — design techniques that lead users to less privacy-protective options — other usability aspects of these interfaces have been less explored. This study contributes a comprehensive, two-stage usability assessment of cookie consent interfaces. We first inspected 191 consent interfaces against five dark pattern heuristics and identified design choices that may impact usability. We then conducted a 1,109-participant online between-subjects experiment exploring the usability impact of seven design parameters. Participants were exposed to one of 12 consent interface variants during a shopping task on a prototype e-commerce website and answered a survey about their experience. Our findings suggest that a fully-blocking consent interface with in-line cookie options accompanied by a persistent button enabling users to later change their consent decision best meets several design objectives.

From treatment to healing: envisioning a decolonial digital mental health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501982,26,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501982,"
The field of digital mental health is making strides in the application of technology to broaden access to care. We critically examine how these technology-mediated forms of care might amplify historical injustices, and erase minoritized experiences and expressions of mental distress and illness. We draw on decolonial thought and critiques of identity-based algorithmic bias to analyze the underlying power relations impacting digital mental health technologies today, and envision new pathways towards a decolonial digital mental health. We argue that a decolonial digital mental health is one that centers lived experience over rigid classification, is conscious of structural factors that influence mental wellbeing, and is fundamentally designed to deter the creation of power differentials that prevent people from having agency over their care. Stemming from this vision, we make recommendations for how researchers and designers can support more equitable futures for people experiencing mental distress and illness.

Exploring the needs of users for supporting privacy-protective behaviors in smart homes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517602,23,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517602,"
 In this paper, we studied people’s smart home privacy-protective behaviors (SH-PPBs), to gain a better understanding of their privacy management do’s and don’ts in this context. We first surveyed 159 participants and elicited 33 unique SH-PPB practices, revealing that users heavily rely on ad hoc approaches at the physical layer (e.g., physical blocking, manual powering off). We also characterized the types of privacy concerns users wanted to address through SH-PPBs, the reasons preventing users from doing SH-PPBs, and privacy features they wished they had to support SH-PPBs. We then storyboarded 11 privacy protection concepts to explore opportunities to better support users’ needs, and asked another 227 participants to criticize and rank these design concepts. Among the 11 concepts, Privacy Diagnostics, which is similar to security diagnostics in anti-virus software, was far preferred over the rest. We also witnessed rich evidence of four important factors in designing SH-PPB tools, as users prefer (1) simple, (2) proactive, (3) preventative solutions that can (4) offer more control.

Virtual reality for mind and body: Does the sense of embodiment towards a virtual body affect physical body awareness?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519613,6,https://downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/2022-chi-body-awareness-virtual-human-perception-preprint.pdf,"
 Mind-body therapies aim to improve health by combining physical and mental exercises. Recent developments tend to incorporate virtual reality (VR) into their design and execution, but there is a lack of research concerning the inclusion of virtual bodies and their effect on body awareness in these designs. In this study, 24 participants performed in-VR body awareness movement tasks in front of a virtual mirror while embodying a photorealistic, personalized avatar. Subsequently, they performed a heartbeat counting task and rated their perceived body awareness and sense of embodiment towards the avatar. We found a significant relationship between sense of embodiment and self-reported body awareness but not between sense of embodiment and heartbeat counting. Future work can build on these findings and further explore the relationship between avatar embodiment and body awareness.

ADHD and technology research–investigated by neurodivergent readers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517592,25,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517592,"
Technology research for neurodivergent conditions is largely shaped by research aims which privilege neuro-normative outcomes. As such, there is an epistemic imbalance in meaning making about these technologies. We conducted a critical literature review of technologies designed for people with ADHD, focusing on how ADHD is framed, the research aims and approaches, the role of people with ADHD within the research process, and the types of systems being developed within Computing and HCI. Our analysis and review is conducted explicitly from an insider perspective, bringing our perspectives as neurodivergent researchers to the topic of technologies in the context of ADHD. We found that 1) technologies are largely used to ‘mitigate’ the experiences of ADHD which are perceived as disruptive to neurotypical standards of behaviour; 2) little HCI research in the area invites this population to co-construct the technologies or to leverage neurodivergent experiences in the construction of research aims; and 3) participant resistance to deficit frames can be read within the researchers’ own accounts of participant actions. We discuss the implications of this status quo for disabled people and technology researchers alike, and close with a set of recommendations for future work in this area.

 People consider recommendations from AI systems in diverse domains ranging from recognizing tumors in medical images to deciding which shoes look cute with an outfit. Implicit in the decision process is the perceived expertise of the AI system. In this paper, we investigate how people trust and rely on an AI assistant that performs with different levels of expertise relative to the person, ranging from completely overlapping expertise to perfectly complementary expertise. Through a series of controlled online lab studies where participants identified objects with the help of an AI assistant, we demonstrate that participants were able to perceive when the assistant was an expert or non-expert within the same task and calibrate their reliance on the AI to improve team performance. We also demonstrate that communicating expertise through the linguistic properties of the explanation text was effective, where embracing language increased reliance and distancing language reduced reliance on AI.

Exploring intervention strategies for distracted students in VR classrooms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519627,5,https://scholar.archive.org/work/pv7n453uyvhnhpth4cpr5li6vm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519627,"
As one of the manifestations of virtual reality (VR) in education, virtual classroom allows students to enjoy a near-real classroom experience. VR class creates much better engagement and helps to stimulate interest and motivation in learning, making it an ideal solution to online teaching and learning activities, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Distraction is an unavoidable problem in immersive virtual classes, which has a great detrimental impact on learning. However, how to intervene in students’ distraction behaviors in immersive virtual environments has not been thoroughly investigated up to now. In this paper, inspired by teachers’ instructional techniques in real-life classes, we propose three intervention strategies, namely eye contact, verbal warning and text warning, and explore the intervening effects of these strategies on the inattention of students seated at the front or back of a virtual classroom via eye tracking. Our results show that all of the proposed intervention strategies have positive impacts on the attention of students. This research gives evidence that teachers’ instructional techniques in the real world can be transferred to the virtual class, which provides a new insight for the future design of educational VR.

Recently, HCI researchers have shown interest in sustainability in the context of both new making methodologies and materials. In this work, we introduce a range of sustainable biomaterials (materials that are bio-based) that we use to create unique interactive interfaces. These biomaterials include ReClaym, a clay-like material made from compost; Alganyl, an algae-based bioplastic; Dinoflagellates, bioluminescent algae; SCOBY, symbiotic cultures of bacteria and yeast; and Spirulina, nutrient-dense blue-green algae. We describe how the implementation of these materials in our designs highlight the importance of utilizing materials that can biodegrade. We also call attention to the importance of care, patience, and understanding during the design processes to facilitate the creation of playful designs that respect the agency of each biomaterial. Lastly, we discuss the gained deeper sense of intimacy and understanding with our biomaterials which not only lead to more personally meaningful interfaces but more sustainable ones.

Weaving stories: Toward repertoires for designing things,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501901,28,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501901,"
While much work is underway within the context of posthuman design, this research is often described from a dominantly human perspective. It rarely accounts for the creative capacities of nonhumans in design, such as materials, tools, and software. There is a need to further engage with posthuman theories conceptually, materially, and methodologically. We approach this challenge through Ron Wakkary's concept of repertoires: actions the human designer can take to increase participation of nonhumans in design research practice. This paper reports on potential repertoires' development by exploring three approaches from outside of HCI: describing the landscape, noticing, and translations. We use these methods to account for weaving events that the first author was engaged in. Through critical reflection of these accounts, we contribute three repertoires and an example of applying the theoretical framework of Designing Things.

“It's Kind of Like Code-Switching”: Black Older Adults' Experiences with a Voice Assistant for Health Information Seeking,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501995,24,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501995,"
 Black older adults from lower socioeconomic environments are often neglected in health technology interventions. Voice assistants have a potential to make healthcare more accessible to older adults, yet, little is known about their experiences with this type of health information seeking, especially Black older adults. Through a three-phase exploratory study, we explored health information seeking with 30 Black older adults in lower-income environments to understand how they ask health-related questions, and their perceptions of the Google Home being used for that purpose. Through our analysis, we identified the health information needs and common search topics, and discussed the communication breakdowns and types of repair performed. We contribute an understanding of cultural code-switching that has to be done by these older adults when interacting with voice assistants, and the importance of such phenomenon when designing for historically excluded groups.

Discovering the syntax and strategies of natural language programming with generative language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501870,22,,"
 In this paper, we present a natural language code synthesis tool, GenLine, backed by 1) a large generative language model and 2) a set of task-specific prompts that create or change code. To understand the user experience of natural language code synthesis with these new types of models, we conducted a user study in which participants applied GenLine to two programming tasks. Our results indicate that while natural language code synthesis can sometimes provide a magical experience, participants still faced challenges. In particular, participants felt that they needed to learn the model’s “syntax,” despite their input being natural language. Participants also struggled to form an accurate mental model of the types of requests the model can reliably translate and developed a set of strategies to debug model input. From these findings, we discuss design implications for future natural language code synthesis tools built using large generative language models.

The paper also illustrates the conceptual architecture of a software framework that can automatically generate conversational agents for the Conversational Web.

Reimagining Systems for Learning Hands-on Creative and Maker Skills,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503732,4,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10354906,"
In the last decade, HCI researchers have designed and engineered several systems to lower the entry barrier for beginners and support novices in learning hands-on creative maker skills. These skills range from building electronics to fabricating physical artifacts. While much of the design and engineering of current learning systems is driven by the advances in technology, we can reimagine these systems by reorienting the design goals around constructivist and sociocultural theories of learning to support learning progression, engagement across artistic disciplines, and designing for inclusivity and accessibility. This one-day workshop aims to bring together the HCI researchers in systems engineering and learning sciences, challenge them to reimagine the future design of systems of learning creative maker skills, form connections across disciplines, and promote collaborative research in the systems of learning creative skills.

"Something personal from the metaverse: goals, topics, and contextual factors of self-disclosure in commercial social VR",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502008,20,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502008,"
 Current Social VR literature provides limited insight on one of the most critical behaviors for developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships: self-disclosure. Therefore, we present an online survey (N = 126) investigating how users disclose personal information to each other in Social VR. Our results indicate that many participants see in Social VR access to authentic connections with others despite tending towards skepticism and privacy concerns. Most users disclose sexuality-related information, lifestyle preferences, and personal goals. In contrast, information that breaks anonymity, such as real names and more intimate aspects of oneself, are shared less commonly. Thereby, self-disclosure decisions depend on factors like the relationship to or age of disclosure recipients, the privacy of a virtual environment, the group size, or the activity context, and is driven by different goals, i.a., relational development or exploration of oneself. These insights advance the understanding of current Social VR users and their behavior by directing future research on self-disclosure-based relationship building in Social VR and outlying broader design implications for the future metaverse.

Variapsody: Creating Three Interactive Music Listening Experiences that Use Diversified Positive Emotion Regulation Strategies to Promote Subjective Well-being,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519743,6,https://files.sigchi.org/conference/attachment/10072/content/73162/poster/7bc5cbc7-549c-2d1c-1b25-9764881c6827.pdf,"
Over the past decade, initiatives to design for subjective well-being have gained increased attention and momentum in design research. These initiatives often draw from positive psychology to explore ways of making Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs) more effective through technology. This paper explores how a mix of tangible and digital technology can realize activity-focused, diverse Emotion Regulation (ER) for its users. We propose that ER strategies can serve as a principle for designing technology that encourages users to savor, modify, reassess, or commemorate their experiences. By centering the design around music listening experiences, the paper explores how users can be supported to lower motivation hurdles that get in the way of frequent engagement with a PPI by developing three exploratory prototypes and reflecting on the development processes. Variapsody, a music listening device, integrates three features, each deploying a different set of ER strategies that make the experience more enjoyable and meaningful. Variapsody's regulatory diversity offers users the choice of how to approach music listening and expands their repertoire of ER strategies. The first feature, Reaction Tile, inscribes users’ reactions to music onto a tangible, domino-sized tile to encourage them to savor the music. The second is Monofilter, which purposefully muffles the salience of background music while working on a cognitively demanding task. Vibelist is the third feature that helps users capture and revisit the context of music listening experiences in a digital collage. The paper discusses the lessons learned and future research opportunities.

 Data science has become an important topic for the CHI conference and community, as shown by many papers and a series of workshops. Previous workshops have taken a critical view of data science from an HCI perspective, working toward a more human–centered treatment of the work of data science and the people who perform the many activities of data science. However, those approaches have not thoroughly examined their own grounds of criticism. In this workshop, we deepen that critical view by turning a reflective lens on the HCI work itself that addresses data science. We invite new perspectives from the diverse research and practice traditions in the broader CHI community, and we hope to co-create a new research agenda that addresses both data science and human-centered approaches to data science.

Generating Embodied Storytelling and Interactive Experience of China Intangible Cultural Heritage “Hua'er” in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519761,5,,"
Hua'er, a type of traditional oral performance, is one of the national intangible cultural heritages (ICH) in China. Experts have been trying to enhance public's awareness of Hua'er protection through digital documentation technology, but there's no efficacious means to attract interest and popularize knowledge yet. In this paper, we propose an interactive VR system engaging audiences to experience and understand the connotation of Hua'er performance. Based on an online survey with the public and in-depth interviews with Hua'er experts, we derive a set of design requirements for generating embodied storytelling and interactive experience in VR. Accordingly, we design “Hua'er and the Youth” (HY) that integrates three methods (virtual avatar, participatory performance, and game-based knowledge acquisition) and conduct a between-subjects user study to compare HY with the Comparison system. The results suggest that our methods significantly improved audience's interactive experience, knowledge level and the awareness of ICH safeguarding.

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging form of aerial transport and is expected to pave the way for a new mobility experience. In order for UAM to be successfully integrated into the current urban transportation system, user experience (UX) considerations need to be explored. However, few studies have revealed the understanding of user needs and requirements from the perspective of transportation experience. In this regard, our research team conducted workshops with vehicle experts to explore important UX considerations for UAM usage according to the initial and mature phases of UAM operations. Also, we uncovered UAM usage motives, potential use cases, as well as three expected forms of UAM operations. The findings from this study contribute to providing insights and design guidelines for UAM UX developers in future urban contexts.

Making data tangible: A cross-disciplinary design space for data physicalization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501939,24,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501939,"
 Designing a data physicalization requires a myriad of different considerations. Despite the cross-disciplinary nature of these considerations, research currently lacks a synthesis across the different communities data physicalization sits upon, including their approaches, theories, and even terminologies. To bridge these communities synergistically, we present a design space that describes and analyzes physicalizations according to three facets: context (end-user considerations), structure (the physical structure of the artifact), and interactions (interactions with both the artifact and data). We construct this design space through a systematic review of 47 physicalizations and analyze the interrelationships of key factors when designing a physicalization. This design space cross-pollinates knowledge from relevant HCI communities, providing a cohesive overview of what designers should consider when creating a data physicalization while suggesting new design possibilities. We analyze the design decisions present in current physicalizations, discuss emerging trends, and identify underlying open challenges.

Cognitive and physical exercises are important factors to support a healthy life, especially considering demographics change. Virtual reality (VR) exergames have great potential to support these activities in a more motivating way. However, regular usage of VR exergames by the older population is still limited. To address this issue, we designed and implemented a VR exergame: Canoe VR. We applied several prototyping sessions with older players and also report the results from interviews with physiotherapists. The results suggest that Canoe VR was very well received and can be used by older players as an additional fitness tool. We discuss the implications of extending a fitness routine with a VR exergame and using the game with players of different abilities.

Ai chains: Transparent and controllable human-ai interaction by chaining large language model prompts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517582,103,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517582,"
Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential on simple tasks, their breadth of scope, lack of transparency, and insufficient controllability can make them less effective when assisting humans on more complex tasks. In response, we introduce the concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, thus aggregating the gains per step. We first define a set of LLM primitive operations useful for Chain construction, then present an interactive system where users can modify these Chains, along with their intermediate results, in a modular way. In a 20-person user study, we found that Chaining not only improved the quality of task outcomes, but also significantly enhanced system transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration. Additionally, we saw that users developed new ways of interacting with LLMs through Chains: they leveraged sub-tasks to calibrate model expectations, compared and contrasted alternative strategies by observing parallel downstream effects, and debugged unexpected model outputs by “unit-testing” sub-components of a Chain. In two case studies, we further explore how LLM Chains may be used in future applications.

 Most prior work on human-AI interaction is set in communities that indicate skepticism towards AI, but we know less about contexts where AI is viewed as aspirational. We investigated the perceptions around AI systems by drawing upon 32 interviews and 459 survey respondents in India. Not only do Indian users accept AI decisions (79.2% respondents indicate acceptance), we find a case of AI authority—AI has a legitimized power to influence human actions, without requiring adequate evidence about the capabilities of the system. AI authority manifested into four user attitudes of vulnerability: faith, forgiveness, self-blame, and gratitude, pointing to higher tolerance for system misfires, and introducing potential for irreversible individual and societal harm. We urgently call for calibrating AI authority, reconsidering success metrics and responsible AI approaches and present methodological suggestions for research and deployments in India.

How do you converse with an analytical chatbot? revisiting gricean maxims for designing analytical conversational behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501972,22,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501972,"
 Chatbots have garnered interest as conversational interfaces for a variety of tasks. While general design guidelines exist for chatbot interfaces, little work explores analytical chatbots that support conversing with data. We explore Gricean Maxims to help inform the basic design of effective conversational interaction. We also draw inspiration from natural language interfaces for data exploration to support ambiguity and intent handling. We ran Wizard of Oz studies with 30 participants to evaluate user expectations for text and voice chatbot design variants. Results identified preferences for intent interpretation and revealed variations in user expectations based on the interface affordances. We subsequently conducted an exploratory analysis of three analytical chatbot systems (text + chart, voice + chart, voice-only) that implement these preferred design variants. Empirical evidence from a second 30-participant study informs implications specific to data-driven conversation such as interpreting intent, data orientation, and establishing trust through appropriate system responses.

The opaque data practices in smart home devices have raised significant privacy concerns for smart home users and bystanders. One way to learn about the data practices is through privacy-related notifications. However, how to deliver these notifications to users and bystanders and increase their awareness of data practices is not clear. We surveyed 136 users and 123 bystanders to understand their preferences of receiving privacy-related notifications in smart homes. We further collected their responses to four mechanisms that improve privacy awareness (e.g., Data Dashboard) as well as their selections of mechanisms in four different scenarios (e.g., friend visiting). Our results showed the pros and cons of each privacy awareness mechanism, e.g., Data Dashboard can help reduce bystanders’ dependence on users. We also found some unique benefits of each mechanism (e.g., Ambient Light could provide unobtrusive privacy awareness). We summarized four key design dimensions for future privacy awareness mechanisms design.

 Misinformation spread through social media has become a fundamental challenge in modern society. Recent studies have evaluated various strategies for addressing this problem, such as by modifying social media platforms or educating people about misinformation, to varying degrees of success. Our goal is to develop a new strategy for countering misinformation: intelligent tools that encourage social media users to foster metacognitive skills ”in the wild.” As a first step, we conducted focus groups with social media users to discover how they can be best supported in combating misinformation. Qualitative analyses of the discussions revealed that people find it difficult to detect misinformation. Findings also indicated a need for but lack of resources to support cross-validation of information. Moreover, misinformation had a nuanced emotional impact on people. Suggestions for the design of intelligent tools that support social media users in information selection, information engagement, and emotional response management are presented.

 Engaging racially and ethnically diverse participants in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research is critical for creating safe, inclusive, and equitable technology. However, it remains unclear why and how HCI researchers collect study participants’ race and ethnicity. Through a systematic literature analysis of 2016–2021 CHI proceedings and a survey with 15 authors who published in these proceedings, we found that reporting race and ethnicity of participants is uncommon and that HCI researchers are far from consensus on the collection and analysis of this data. Because a majority (>90%) of the articles that report participants’ race and ethnicity are conducted in the United States, we focused our discussion on race and ethnicity accordingly. In future work, we plan to investigate considerations and best practices for collecting and analyzing race and ethnicity data in a global context.

Extended Reality (AR/VR/MR) technology is becoming increasingly affordable and capable, becoming ever more interwoven with everyday life. HCI research has focused largely on innovation around XR technology, exploring new use cases and interaction techniques, understanding how this technology is used and appropriated etc. However, equally important is the investigation and consideration of risks posed by such advances, specifically in contributing to new vulnerabilities and attack vectors with regards to security, safety, and privacy that are unique to XR. For example perceptual manipulations in VR, such as redirected walking or haptic retargeting, have been developed to enhance interaction, yet subversive use of such techniques has been demonstrated to unlock new harms, such as redirecting the VR user into a collision. This workshop will convene researchers focused on HCI, XR, Safety, Security, and Privacy, with the intention of exploring safety, privacy, and security challenges of XR technology. With an HCI lens, workshop participants will engage in critical assessment of emerging XR technologies and develop an XR research agenda that integrates research on interaction technologies and techniques with safety, security and privacy research.

Diffraction-in-action: designerly explorations of agential realism through lived data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502029,25,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502029,"
 Recent design research has shown an interest in diffraction and agential realism, which promise to offer generative alternatives when designing with data that resist treating data as objective or neutral. We explore engaging diffractively with ‘lived data’ to surface felt and prospective aspects of data as it is entangled in everyday lives of designers. This paper presents five biodata-based case studies demonstrating how design researchers can create knowledge about human bodies and behaviors via strategies that allow them to engage data diffractively. These studies suggest that designers can find insights for designing with data as it is lived by working with it in a slow, open-ended fashion that leaves room for messiness and time for discovering difference. Finally, we discuss the role of ambiguous, open-ended data interpretations to help surface different meanings and entanglements of data in everyday lives.

Exploring the role of local and global explanations in recommender systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519795,6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13301,"
 Explanations are well-known to improve recommender systems’ transparency. These explanations may be local, explaining individual recommendations, or global, explaining the recommender model overall. Despite their widespread use, there has been little investigation into the relative benefits of the two explanation approaches. We conducted a 30-participant exploratory study and a 30-participant controlled user study with a research-paper recommender to analyze how providing local, global, or both explanations influences user understanding of system behavior. Our results provide evidence suggesting that both are more helpful than either alone for explaining how to improve recommendations, yet both appeared less helpful than global alone for efficiently identifying false positive and negative recommendations. However, we note that the two explanation approaches may be better compared in a higher-stakes or more opaque domain.

Virtual painkillers: Designing accessible virtual reality experiences for helping cancer patients manage pain at home,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503562,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angelos-Kassianos/publication/360334711_Virtual_Painkillers_Designing_Accessible_Virtual_Reality_Experiences_for_Helping_Cancer_Patients_Manage_Pain_at_Home/links/6273d1a73a23744a72660730/Virtual-Painkillers-Designing-Accessible-Virtual-Reality-Experiences-for-Helping-Cancer-Patients-Manage-Pain-at-Home.pdf,"
More than half of cancer patients are dealing with moderately severe pain on a monthly basis and most of them report a breakthrough pain experience at least once. Despite the importance of pain management for cancer patients, cancer pain remains undertreated. With computer technology and especially Virtual Reality offering open endless opportunities for pain management, we must consider how low-cost home-based Virtual Reality for cancer patients can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching pain management experiences. Working closely with 51 cancer patients, medical and paramedical personnel, we co-designed an intelligent personalized mobile application to first collect ecologically momentary assessment data on symptoms like pain and fatigue and Health-Related Quality of Life and subsequently enhance symptom management of cancer patients at home. Through this paper, we thoroughly explain the screening process and quantitative analysis we run to identify which environments patients would like to receive as a Virtual Reality intervention that can facilitate the design of Virtual Reality interventions for cancer patients.

Forgetting practices in the data sciences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517644,18,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517644,"
 HCI engages with data science through many topics and themes. Researchers have addressed biased dataset problems, arguing that bad data can cause innocent software to produce bad outcomes. But what if our software is not so innocent? What if the human decisions that shape our data-processing software, inadvertently contribute their own sources of bias? And what if our data-work technology causes us to forget those decisions and operations? Based in feminisms and critical computing, we analyze forgetting practices in data work practices. We describe diverse beneficial and harmful motivations for forgetting. We contribute: (1) a taxonomy of data silences in data work, which we use to analyze how data workers forget, erase, and unknow aspects of data; (2) a detailed analysis of forgetting practices in machine learning; and (3) an analytic vocabulary for future work in remembering, forgetting, and erasing in HCI and the data sciences.

A case study on user experience bootcamps with teens to co-design real-time online safety interventions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503563,6,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10405527,"
We conducted User Experience (UX) Bootcamps with teens (ages 13-17) to teach them important UX design skills and industry standard tools for co-designing effective online safety interventions or “nudges”. In the process, we asked teens to storyboard about their risky or uncomfortable experiences and design high-fidelity prototypes for online safety interventions that would help mitigate these negative experiences. In this case study, we present our methodology, feedback from teens, challenges, and lessons learned in conducting our UX Bootcamps for adolescent online safety. We recommend that future researchers who want to conduct similar research with teens to encourage group activities, balance teen autonomy with researcher assistance, and ensure teens’ privacy and well-being. Finally, we provide useful guidelines for conducting virtual training and research studies with teens.

(Re) discovering the physical body online: Strategies and challenges to approach non-cisgender identity in social Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502082,18,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502082,"
 The contemporary understanding of gender continues to highlight the complexity and variety of gender identities beyond a binary dichotomy regarding one’s biological sex assigned at birth. The emergence and popularity of various online social spaces also makes the digital presentation of gender even more sophisticated. In this paper, we use non-cisgender as an umbrella term to describe diverse gender identities that do not match people’s sex assigned at birth, including Transgender, Genderfluid, and Non-binary. We especially explore non-cisgender individuals’ identity practices and their challenges in novel social Virtual Reality (VR) spaces where they can present, express, and experiment their identity in ways that traditional online social spaces cannot provide. We provide one of the first empirical evidence of how social VR platforms may introduce new and novel phenomena and practices of approaching diverse gender identities online. We also contribute to re-conceptualizing technology-supported identity practices by highlighting the role of (re)discovering the physical body online and informing the design of the emerging metaverse for supporting diverse gender identities in the future.

Beyond Meditation: Everyday Mindfulness and Technology Use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519820,7,https://leshed.infosci.cornell.edu/files/2022/08/Li-beyond-meditation.pdf,"
 Mindfulness, a practice of maintaining awareness by bringing attention to the present without judgment, has many mental and physical well-being benefits when practiced consistently. Many technologies have been invented to support mindfulness practice: mobile apps, web resources, virtual reality environments, and wearables. We present findings from a semi-structured interview study with 6 experienced mindfulness practitioners to understand their daily practice experiences and technologies they incorporate in their practice. Participants identify the benefits and challenges of developing long-term commitment to mindfulness practice, and combine informal mindfulness practice in their daily activities in addition to formal meditation. While conflicted about including and even relying on technology, they adopt and appropriate a range of technologies in their daily practice, some of which are not designed for mindfulness, such as productivity tools and media streaming. Based on our findings, we suggest that designers of mindfulness technologies be cautious about applying behavioral change design principles and go beyond meditation to better situate the tools in practitioners’ existing daily routines.

Habilyzer: A User-Driven Open-Ended Sensor Kit for Office Workers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519884,5,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/50538/2/3491101.3519884.pdf,"
Office work presents health and wellbeing challenges, triggered by working habits or environmental factors. While technological interventions gain popularity in the workplace, they often fall short of acknowledging personal needs. Building on approaches from personal informatics, we present our vision on the use of user-driven, situated sensor probes in an office context and how the community might deal with complex yet timely questions around the use of data to empower people in becoming explorers of their own habits and experiences. We demonstrate Habilyzer, an open-ended sensor toolkit for office workers, which enables user-driven explorations in self-tracking their work routines. This research contributes an alternative approach to improving working habits and vitality in the workplace, moving from solution-oriented technologies to inquiry-enabling tools. Through this demonstration, we also aim to trigger discussions on the use of sensors and data in the office context, in the light of privacy, consent and data ownership.

 Emotional self-reliance is a key factor in psychological well-being. Individuals with Allism Spectrum Disorder often face challenges in interpersonal communication and social settings. Especially experiences of emotion echolalia, the mirroring of others’ emotions, can cause not only impairment in communication and relationships with others, but significant emotional distress, putting the mental well-being of allistic people at risk. In this paper, we report on the design of FaceSavr™, a digital textile protective system against emotion echolalia, and describe our participatory design process with seven allistic adults.

Leveraging curiosity to encourage social interactions in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: preliminary results using the interactive toy PlusMe,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519716,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/87178193/3491101.pdf,"
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental conditions, often characterised by important impairments in the social area. In the context of early intervention, we present preliminary results about the social behaviour of children with ASD using PlusMe as an experimental interactive toy, which is the first prototype of Transitional Wearable Companions concept. Specifically, PlusMe is designed to stimulate the children’s curiosity and encourage behaviour on the basis of social interaction. The pilot test involved five high-functioning children, mean age 41 months, range 36-50 months. The participants were engaged in play activities together with the PlusMe toy and two researchers who aimed to encourage the children’s social behaviour such as imitation and eye contact; the activities were repeated for four sessions (one per week). Although it is an ongoing study on a larger sample, the first data analysis is promising, preliminary observations seem to demonstrate that PlusMe can be used to improve some social behaviour such as eye contact, imitation, the interaction between two people.

MisVis: Explaining web misinformation connections via visual summary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519711,4,https://poloclub.github.io/papers/22-chi-misvis.pdf,"
Identifying and raising awareness about web misinformation is crucial as the Internet has become a major source of information for many people. We introduce MisVis, a web-based interactive tool that helps users better assess misinformation websites and understand their connections with other misinformation sites through visual explanations. Different from the existing techniques that primarily only focus on alerting users of misinformation, MisVis provides new ways to visualize how the site is involved in spreading information on the web and social media. Through MisVis, we contribute novel interactive visual design: Summary View helps users understand a site’s overall reliability by showing the distributions of its linked websites; Graph View presents users with the connection details of how a site is linked to other misinformation websites. In collaboration with researchers at a large security company, we are working to deploy MisVis as a web browser extension for broader impact.

"Measuring the user experience of vibrotactile feedback on the finger, wrist, and forearm for touch input on large displays",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519704,4,https://hal.science/hal-03695523/document,"
 We examine vibrotactile feedback delivered on the finger, wrist, and forearm with the goal of enriching the experience of touch input interactions with public displays. We focus on understanding the user experience of such interactions, which we characterize with a wide spectrum of UX measures, including subjective perceptions of the enjoyment, efficiency, input confidence, integration between touch input and on-body vibrations, distraction, confusion, and complexity of vibrotactile feedback for touch input with public displays. Our empirical findings, from a controlled experiment with fourteen participants, show positive and favorable perceptions of vibrotactile feedback as well as a significant preference for feedback on the finger compared to the wrist and forearm.

Neo: Generalizing confusion matrix visualization to hierarchical and multi-output labels,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501823,24,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501823,"
The confusion matrix, a ubiquitous visualization for helping people evaluate machine learning models, is a tabular layout that compares predicted class labels against actual class labels over all data instances. We conduct formative research with machine learning practitioners at Apple and find that conventional confusion matrices do not support more complex data-structures found in modern-day applications, such as hierarchical and multi-output labels. To express such variations of confusion matrices, we design an algebra that models confusion matrices as probability distributions. Based on this algebra, we develop Neo, a visual analytics system that enables practitioners to flexibly author and interact with hierarchical and multi-output confusion matrices, visualize derived metrics, renormalize confusions, and share matrix specifications. Finally, we demonstrate Neo’s utility with three model evaluation scenarios that help people better understand model performance and reveal hidden confusions.

Can a Recommender System Support Treatment Personalisation in Digital Mental Health Therapy? A Quantitative Feasibility Assessment Using Data from a …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519840,3,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146133/3491101.3519840.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
 Recommender systems have the potential to improve the user experience of digital mental health apps. Personalised recommendations can help users to identify therapy tasks that they find most enjoyable or helpful, thus boosting their engagement with the service and optimising the extent to which it helps them to feel better. Using a dataset containing 23,476 ratings collected from 973 players of a mental health therapy game, this work demonstrates how collaborative filtering algorithms can predict how much a user will benefit from a new therapy task with greater accuracy than a simpler baseline algorithm that predicts the average rating for a task, adjusted for the biases of the specific user and specific task. Collaborative filtering algorithms (matrix factorisation and k-nearest neighbour) outperform this baseline with a 6.5-8.3% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and context-aware collaborative filtering algorithms (factorisation machines) outperform with a 7.8-8.8% improvement in MAE. These results suggest that recommender systems could be a useful tool for tailoring recommendations of new therapy tasks to a user based on a combination of their past preferences, the ratings of similar users, and their current context. This scalable approach to personalisation – which does not require a human therapist to always be in-the-loop – could play an important role in improving engagement and outcomes in digital mental health therapies.

Relive: Bridging in-situ and ex-situ visual analytics for analyzing mixed reality user studies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517550,19,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517550,"
 The nascent field of mixed reality is seeing an ever-increasing need for user studies and field evaluation, which are particularly challenging given device heterogeneity, diversity of use, and mobile deployment. Immersive analytics tools have recently emerged to support such analysis in situ, yet the complexity of the data also warrants an ex-situ analysis using more traditional non-immersive visual analytics setups. To bridge the gap between both approaches, we introduce ReLive: a mixed-immersion visual analytics framework for exploring and analyzing mixed reality user studies. ReLive combines an in-situ virtual reality view with a complementary ex-situ desktop view. While the virtual reality view allows users to relive interactive spatial recordings replicating the original study, the synchronized desktop view provides a familiar interface for analyzing aggregated data. We validated our concepts in a two-step evaluation consisting of a design walkthrough and an empirical expert user study.

Meeting Users Where They Are: User-centered Design of an Automated Text Messaging Tool to Support the Mental Health of Young Adults,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502046,17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098159/,"
 Young adults have high rates of mental health conditions, but most do not want or cannot access formal treatment. We therefore recruited young adults with depression or anxiety symptoms to co-design a digital tool for self-managing their mental health concerns. Through study activities—consisting of an online discussion group and a series of design workshops—participants highlighted the importance of easy-to-use digital tools that allow them to exercise independence in their self-management. They described ways that an automated messaging tool might benefit them by: facilitating experimentation with diverse concepts and experiences; allowing variable depth of engagement based on preferences, availability, and mood; and collecting feedback to personalize the tool. While participants wanted to feel supported by an automated tool, they cautioned against incorporating an overtly human-like motivational tone. We discuss ways to apply these findings to improve the design and dissemination of digital mental health tools for young adults.

From-The-Wild: Towards Co-Designing For and From Nature,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519811,6,http://ferranaltarriba.com/docs/papers/22_chi_ftw.pdf,"
Here we present in-progress methodological research exploring how to co-design technology for nature-related experiences. To support increasingly situated and participatory practices in this space, we propose a turn towards co-designing from-the-wild, i.e. ideating during raw engagements that are radically situated in nature. Our approach extends existing in-the-wild practices by (1) enacting co-design in natural (rather than human-made) environments, and (2) avoiding techniques that privilege the designer's agenda over other stakeholders’ and compromise the situated nature of ideation. Our contribution includes: (1) the proposal of co-designing from-the-wild as a response to the limitations of existing in-the-wild methods when designing for and from nature; and (2) early reflections from our hands-on engagement with said approach, which begin to surface exciting opportunities and constraints emerging in this methodological space. By sharing our work-in-progress with the HCI community, we hope to spark a conversation stimulating future co-design methods research in increasingly wilder directions.

UX research on conversational human-AI interaction: A literature review of the ACM Digital Library,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501855,20,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09895,"
Early conversational agents (CAs) focused on dyadic human-AI interaction between humans and the CAs, followed by the increasing popularity of polyadic human-AI interaction, in which CAs are designed to mediate human-human interactions. CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across different fields, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identified a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the effects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the effects. Our findings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identification, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs. Future research should also advance usability testing methods and trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.

“It's common and a part of being a content creator”: Understanding How Creators Experience and Cope with Hate and Harassment Online,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501879,17,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501879,"
 Content creators—social media personalities with large audiences on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube—face a heightened risk of online hate and harassment. We surveyed 135 creators to understand their personal experiences with attacks (including toxic comments, impersonation, stalking, and more), the coping practices they employ, and gaps they experience with existing solutions (such as moderation or reporting). We find that while a majority of creators view audience interactions favorably, nearly every creator could recall at least one incident of hate and harassment, and attacks are a regular occurrence for one in three creators. As a result of hate and harassment, creators report self-censoring their content and leaving platforms. Through their personal stories, their attitudes towards platform-provided tools, and their strategies for coping with attacks and harms, we inform the broader design space for how to better protect people online from hate and harassment.

 Research output related to digital nudging has increased ten-fold over the last five years. Nudging in the digital realm differs from its analog counterpart in important ways. For instance, online, choice architectures can be interconnected and personalized using real time data. In the face of this development, it is crucial to understand the current state of the literature and to map out possible research gaps. This paper addresses this issue and provides a systematic review of empirical studies where digital nudges have been evaluated. The systematic review covers 73 peer-reviewed papers containing 109 separate studies where 231 digital nudges have been evaluated. Our results lead to nine open research questions to be addressed in the future by the research community.

 This project illuminates Black women and femme’s experiences with unwanted behavior and harassment on social media, and how they (re)claim and transform their experiences to cope, heal, and experience joy. This work situates Black women and femmes’ experiences within extant social media research, and examines how their unique identity creates multiple forms of interlocking oppression. In our focus groups, participants (N=49) described harms they experienced through racism, misogynoir, ableism, and sexual objectification, and their complex labor of protecting and transforming their experiences online. Despite the harmful effects of unwanted behavior online, participants described a Black feminist transformative politic, in which they cultivated healing and joy through various methods offline and online. Using a transformative justice lens, we discuss their experiences of harassment from white women and men, as well as the complexities of cultural betrayal when experiencing harassment from Black men.

Hand interfaces: Using hands to imitate objects in AR/VR for expressive interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501898,20,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501898,"
 Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies create exciting new opportunities for people to interact with computing resources and information. Less exciting is the need for holding hand controllers, which limits applications that demand expressive, readily available interactions. Prior research investigated freehand AR/VR input by transforming the user’s body into an interaction medium. In contrast to previous work that has users’ hands grasp virtual objects, we propose a new interaction technique that lets users’ hands become virtual objects by imitating the objects themselves. For example, a thumbs-up hand pose is used to mimic a joystick. We created a wide array of interaction designs around this idea to demonstrate its applicability in object retrieval and interactive control tasks. Collectively, we call these interaction designs Hand Interfaces. From a series of user studies comparing Hand Interfaces against various baseline techniques, we collected quantitative and qualitative feedback, which indicates that Hand Interfaces are effective, expressive, and fun to use.

Designing Non-Verbal Humorous Gestures for a Non-Humanoid Robot,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519924,3,https://milab.runi.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3491101.3519924.pdf,"
Humor has various positive implications for our daily lives, and it has shown to improve human-robot interaction as well. To date, humor has been applied to robots that mimic human behavior thus missing out on improving interactions with the non-humanoid robots continually being deployed to our daily lives. In this work, we conducted an initial evaluation of the far-out possibility to create non-verbal humorous behavior for a robot with no human features. The robot’s humorous gestures were designed by a clown therapist, animator, and HRI expert. The initial evaluation compared participants’ responses to humorous and non-humorous robotic gestures. Our study indicates it is possible for a simple non-humanoid robot to communicate a humorous experience through gestures alone, provided the movements are carefully balanced to bring about this good humor encounter. This study’s gesture design insights can serve as first steps toward leveraging humorous behaviors in non-humanoid robots to enhance HRI.

Battling bias in primary care encounters: informatics designs to support clinicians,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519825,3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9128862/,"
Although clinical training in implicit bias is essential for healthcare equity, major gaps remain both for effective educational strategies and for tools to help identify implicit bias. To understand the perspectives of clinicians on the design of these needed strategies and tools, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with primary care clinicians about their perspectives and design recommendations for tools to improve patient-centered communication and to help mitigate implicit bias. Participants generated three types of solutions to improve communication and raise awareness of implicit bias: digital nudges, guided reflection, and data-driven feedback. Given the nuance of implicit bias communication feedback, these findings illustrate innovative design directions for communication training strategies that clinicians may find acceptable. Improving communication skills through individual feedback designed by clinicians for clinicians has the potential to improve healthcare equity.

 Accessibility research aims to aid humans that experience minor or major disabilities and conditions. However, researchers might have limited exposure to certain disabilities, therefore, focus on those prevalent in their own lives. This work presents a script-based meta-analysis on addressed populations in accessibility research published on top Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) venues (3617 full papers). We categorize the publications regarding the involved people and their disabilities. We found that work on vision disability makes up for almost one third (28.85%) of the work published in general HCI. In light of these findings, we present possible conference- and funding-related explanatory approaches and argue that disability research could more reflect the prevalence of disabilities in the world.

“I didn't know I looked angry”: Characterizing observed emotion and reported affect at work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517453,17,https://harmanpk.github.io/Papers/CHI2022_Emotion_Recognition.pdf,"
 With the growing prevalence of affective computing applications, Automatic Emotion Recognition (AER) technologies have garnered attention in both research and industry settings. Initially limited to speech-based applications, AER technologies now include analysis of facial landmarks to provide predicted probabilities of a common subset of emotions (e.g., anger, happiness) for faces observed in an image or video frame. In this paper, we study the relationship between AER outputs and self-reports of affect employed by prior work, in the context of information work at a technology company. We compare the continuous observed emotion output from an AER tool to discrete reported affect obtained via a one-day combined tool-use and diary study (N = 15). We provide empirical evidence showing that these signals do not completely align, and find that using additional workplace context only improves alignment up to 58.6%. These results suggest affect must be studied in the context it is being expressed, and observed emotion signal should not replace internal reported affect for affective computing applications.

Model positionality and computational reflexivity: Promoting reflexivity in data science,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501998,18,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501998,"
 Data science and machine learning provide indispensable techniques for understanding phenomena at scale, but the discretionary choices made when doing this work are often not recognized. Drawing from qualitative research practices, we describe how the concepts of positionality and reflexivity can be adapted to provide a framework for understanding, discussing, and disclosing the discretionary choices and subjectivity inherent to data science work. We first introduce the concepts of model positionality and computational reflexivity that can help data scientists to reflect on and communicate the social and cultural context of a model’s development and use, the data annotators and their annotations, and the data scientists themselves. We then describe the unique challenges of adapting these concepts for data science work and offer annotator fingerprinting and position mining as promising solutions. Finally, we demonstrate these techniques in a case study of the development of classifiers for toxic commenting in online communities.

Accessibility Feedback in Mobile Application Reviews: A Dataset of Reviews and Accessibility Guidelines,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519625,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yasmine-Elglaly/publication/360408448_Accessibility_Feedback_in_Mobile_Application_Reviews_A_Dataset_of_Reviews_and_Accessibility_Guidelines/links/6279431a973bbb29cc6ec19f/Accessibility-Feedback-in-Mobile-Application-Reviews-A-Dataset-of-Reviews-and-Accessibility-Guidelines.pdf,"
 User reviews represent a valuable source of information for developers and researchers to learn about the challenges users are facing when using mobile applications (apps). However, studies analyzing mobile app reviews from an accessibility perspective are limited. This paper aims to better understand how accessibility issues are expressed in reviews to reveal potential associations with accessibility guidelines. To this end, we categorized 1,200 accessibility reviews using accessibility categories from previous studies and the W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1). Our results indicate that accessibility user reviews contain accessibility-specific information. This information, while expressed by users in terms that may differ from the technical terms, were still indicative of specific accessibility guideline violations. Our new dataset can potentially be used by app developers to better understand users’ accessibility experience.

Designing word filter tools for creator-led comment moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517505,18,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08818,"
 Online social platforms centered around content creators often allow comments on content, where creators can then moderate the comments they receive. As creators can face overwhelming numbers of comments, with some of them harassing or hateful, platforms typically provide tools such as word filters for creators to automate aspects of moderation. From needfinding interviews with 19 creators about how they use existing tools, we found that they struggled with writing good filters as well as organizing and revising their filters, due to the difficulty of determining what the filters actually catch. To address these issues, we present FilterBuddy, a system that supports creators in authoring new filters or building from pre-made ones, as well as organizing their filters and visualizing what comments are captured by them over time. We conducted an early-stage evaluation of FilterBuddy with YouTube creators, finding that participants see FilterBuddy not just as a moderation tool, but also a means to organize their comments to better understand their audiences.

Whose AI Dream? In search of the aspiration in data annotation.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502121,18,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10748,"
Data is fundamental to AI/ML models. This paper investigates the work practices concerning data annotation as performed in the industry, in India. Previous human-centred investigations have largely focused on annotators’ subjectivity, bias and efficiency. We present a wider perspective of the data annotation: following a grounded approach, we conducted three sets of interviews with 25 annotators, 10 industry experts and 12 ML/AI practitioners. Our results show that the work of annotators is dictated by the interests, priorities and values of others above their station. More than technical, we contend that data annotation is a systematic exercise of power through organizational structure and practice. We propose a set of implications for how we can cultivate and encourage better practice to balance the tension between the need for high quality data at low cost and the annotators’ aspiration for well-being, career perspective, and active participation in building the AI dream.

"Narrativity, Audience, Legitimacy: Data Practices of Community Organizers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519673,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519673,"
 Community organizers build grassroots power and collective voice in communities that are structurally marginalized in representative democracy, particularly in minoritized communities. Our project explores how self-identified community organizers use the narrative potentials of data to navigate the promises of data activism and the simultaneous risks posed to working-class communities of color by data-intensive technologies. Our nine respondents consistently named the material, financial, intellectual, and affective demands of data work, as well as the provisional, tenuous possibility of accomplishing movement work via narratives bolstered by data. Our early results identified two important factors in community organizers’ assessment of the efficacy and political potential of narratives built with data: audience and legitimacy.

Towards collaborative learning in virtual reality: A comparison of co-located symmetric and asymmetric pair-learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517641,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517641,"
 Pair-learning is beneficial for learning outcome, motivation, and social presence, and so is virtual reality (VR) by increasing immersion, engagement, motivation, and interest of students. Nevertheless, there is a research gap if the benefits of pair-learning and VR can be combined. Furthermore, it is not clear which influence it has if only one or both peers use VR. To investigate these aspects, we implemented two types of VR pair-learning systems, a symmetric system with both peers using VR and an asymmetric system with one using a tablet. In a user study (N=46), the symmetric system statistically significantly provided higher presence, immersion, player experience, and lower intrinsic cognitive load, which are all important for learning. Symmetric and asymmetric systems performed equally well regarding learning outcome, highlighting that both are valuable learning systems. We used these findings to define guidelines on how to design co-located VR pair-learning applications, including characteristics for symmetric and asymmetric systems.

Care infrastructures for digital security in intimate partner violence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502038,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502038,"
Survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) face complex threats to their digital privacy and security. Prior work has established protocols for directly helping them mitigate these harms; however, there remains a need for flexible and pluralistic systems that can support survivors’ long-term needs. This paper describes the design and development of sociotechnical infrastructure that incorporates feminist notions of care to connect IPV survivors experiencing technology abuse with volunteer computer security consultants. We present findings from a mixed methods study that draws on data from an 8-month, real-world deployment, as well as interviews with 7 volunteer technology consultants and 18 IPV professionals. Our findings illuminate emergent challenges in safely and adaptively providing computer security advice as care. We discuss implications of these findings for feminist approaches to computer security and privacy, and provide broader lessons for interventions that aim to directly assist at-risk and marginalized people experiencing digital insecurity.

Voxlens: Making online data visualizations accessible with an interactive javascript plug-in,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517431,18,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517431,"
JavaScript visualization libraries are widely used to create online data visualizations but provide limited access to their information for screen-reader users. Building on prior findings about the experiences of screen-reader users with online data visualizations, we present VoxLens, an open-source JavaScript plug-in that—with a single line of code—improves the accessibility of online data visualizations for screen-reader users using a multi-modal approach. Specifically, VoxLens enables screen-reader users to obtain a holistic summary of presented information, play sonified versions of the data, and interact with visualizations in a “drill-down” manner using voice-activated commands. Through task-based experiments with 21 screen-reader users, we show that VoxLens improves the accuracy of information extraction and interaction time by 122% and 36%, respectively, over existing conventional interaction with online data visualizations. Our interviews with screen-reader users suggest that VoxLens is a “game-changer” in making online data visualizations accessible to screen-reader users, saving them time and effort.

Annotating line charts for addressing deception,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502138,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502138,"
 Deceptive visualizations are visualizations that, whether intentionally or not, lead the reader to an understanding of the data which varies from the actual data. Examples of deceptive visualizations can be found in every digital platform, and, despite their widespread use in the wild, there have been limited efforts to alert laypersons to common deceptive visualization practices. In this paper, we present a tool for annotating line charts in the wild that reads line chart images and outputs text and visual annotations to assess the line charts for distortions and help guide the reader towards an honest understanding of the chart data. We demonstrate the usefulness of our tool through a series of case studies on real-world charts. Finally, we perform a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the ability of the proposed tool to educate readers about potentially deceptive visualization practices.

How Experienced Designers of Enterprise Applications Engage AI as a Design Material,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517491,17,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517491,"
 HCI research has explored AI as a design material, suggesting that designers can envision AI’s design opportunities to improve UX. Recent research claimed that enterprise applications offer an opportunity for AI innovation at the user experience level. We conducted design workshops to explore the practices of experienced designers who work on cross-functional AI teams in the enterprise. We discussed how designers successfully work with and struggle with AI. Our findings revealed that designers can innovate at the system and service levels. We also discovered that making a case for an AI feature’s return on investment is a barrier for designers when they propose AI concepts and ideas. Our discussions produced novel insights on designers’ role on AI teams, and the boundary objects they used for collaborating with data scientists. We discuss the implications of these findings as opportunities for future research aiming to empower designers in working with data and AI.

Investigating the potential of artificial intelligence powered interfaces to support different types of memory for people with dementia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519858,4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9201618/,"
 There has been a growing interest in HCI to understand the specific technological needs of people with dementia and supporting them in self-managing daily activities. One of the most difficult challenges to address is supporting the fluctuating accessibility needs of people with dementia, which vary with the specific type of dementia and the progression of the condition. Researchers have identified auto-personalized interfaces, and more recently, Artificial Intelligence or AI-driven personalization as a potential solution to making commercial technology accessible in a scalable manner for users with fluctuating ability. However, there is a lack of understanding on the perceptions of people with dementia around AI as an aid to their everyday technology use and its role in their overall self-management systems, which include other non-AI technology, and human assistance. In this paper, we present future directions for the design of AI-based systems to personalize an interface for dementia-related changes in different types of memory, along with expectations for AI interactions with the user with dementia.

 Voice-based Conversational Agents (CAs) are increasingly being used by children. Through a review of 38 research papers, this work maps trends, themes, and methods of empirical research on children and CAs in HCI research over the last decade. A thematic analysis of the research found that work in this domain focuses on seven key topics: ascribing human-like qualities to CAs, CAs? support of children?s learning, the use and role of CAs in the home and family context, CAs? support of children?s play, children?s storytelling with CA, issues concerning the collection of information revealed by CAs, and CAs designed for children with differing abilities. Based on our findings, we identify the needs to account for children’s intersectional identities and linguistic and cultural diversity and theories from multiple disciples in the design of CAs, develop heuristics for child-centric interaction with CAs, to investigate implications of CAs on social cognition and interpersonal relationships, and to examine and design for multi-party interactions with CAs for different domains and contexts.

Care workers making use of robots: Results of a three-month study on human-robot interaction within a care home,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517435,17,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517435,"
 Research on social robots in care has often focused on either the care recipients or the technology itself, neglecting the care workers who, in and through their collaborative and coordinative practices, will need to work with the robots. To better understand these interactions with a social robot (Pepper), we undertook a 3 month long-term study within a care home to gain empirical insights into the way the robot was used. We observed how care workers learned to use the device, applied it to their daily work life, and encountered obstacles. Our findings show that the care workers used the robot regularly (1:07 hours/day) mostly in one-to-one interactions with residents. While the robot had a limited effect on reducing the workload of care workers, it had other positive effects, demonstrating the potential to enhance the quality of care.

Mouth Haptics in VR using a headset ultrasound phased array,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501960,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3501960,"
 Today’s consumer virtual reality (VR) systems offer limited haptic feedback via vibration motors in handheld controllers. Rendering haptics to other parts of the body is an open challenge, especially in a practical and consumer-friendly manner. The mouth is of particular interest, as it is a close second in tactile sensitivity to the fingertips, offering a unique opportunity to add fine-grained haptic effects. In this research, we developed a thin, compact, beamforming array of ultrasonic transducers, which can render haptic effects onto the mouth. Importantly, all components are integrated into the headset, meaning the user does not need to wear an additional accessory, or place any external infrastructure in their room. We explored several effects, including point impulses, swipes, and persistent vibrations. Our haptic sensations can be felt on the lips, teeth and tongue, which can be incorporated into new and interesting VR experiences.

This paper addresses calls for more research on privacy in the gig economy across a range of work platforms. To understand privacy risks, behaviors, and consequences from the perspective of workers, we analyzed workers’ posts about privacy and surveillance from 12 Reddit forums representing four main types of work (crowdwork, freelancing, ridesharing, and delivery). We found that workers perceive both platform companies and customers as sources of unnecessary and opaque data collection and surveillance that can threaten their privacy, safety, and economic outcomes. Workers also engage in many risk mitigation strategies, including self-protective surveillance behaviors such as video recording themselves and customers, as a costly but necessary response to power imbalances created by surveillance. Based on our multi-platform analysis, we present a guiding set of questions that workers, designers, and researchers can use to assess the privacy implications of current and future gig work platforms.

Investigating positive and negative qualities of human-in-the-loop optimization for designing interaction techniques,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501850,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501850,"
 Designers reportedly struggle with design optimization tasks where they are asked to find a combination of design parameters that maximizes a given set of objectives. In HCI, design optimization problems are often exceedingly complex, involving multiple objectives and expensive empirical evaluations. Model-based computational design algorithms assist designers by generating design examples during design, however they assume a model of the interaction domain. Black box methods for assistance, on the other hand, can work with any design problem. However, virtually all empirical studies of this human-in-the-loop approach have been carried out by either researchers or end-users. The question stands out if such methods can help designers in realistic tasks. In this paper, we study Bayesian optimization as an algorithmic method to guide the design optimization process. It operates by proposing to a designer which design candidate to try next, given previous observations. We report observations from a comparative study with 40 novice designers who were tasked to optimize a complex 3D touch interaction technique. The optimizer helped designers explore larger proportions of the design space and arrive at a better solution, however they reported lower agency and expressiveness. Designers guided by an optimizer reported lower mental effort but also felt less creative and less in charge of the progress. We conclude that human-in-the-loop optimization can support novice designers in cases where agency is not critical.

Asian CHI Symposium: Decolonizing Technology Design in Asia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503701,5,,"
The Asian CHI symposium is an annual event organized by researchers and practitioners in the Asia Pacific since the authors first co-initiated South East Asia Computer-Human Interaction (SEACHI) during CHI 2015 [1]. The symposium aims to bring together both early-career and senior HCI academia and UX practitioners from industries in the Asia Pacific and bring about cross-exchange of information and transfer of knowledge in a multidisciplinary environment and multi-socio-economic aspects of HCI research, foster social ties and collaboration in the field of HCI [2]. As the Asian CHI community grows to be more diverse than when we started in 2015, there is a need to address the issues of equity, justice, access, and transparency more strategically, especially with a historical link to colonialism in Asia. Beyond showcasing the latest Asian-inspired HCI work and those focusing on incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design, implementation, evaluation, and improvement, the Asian CHI Symposium 2022 is a sandbox for decolonizing yet academically rigorous discourse platform for both HCI academic and UX practitioners to present their latest research findings and solutions that reflect the expansion of HCI theory and applications towards culturally inclusive design for diverse audiences in Asia.

 Online harm is a prevalent issue in adolescents’ online lives. Restorative justice teaches us to focus on those who have been harmed, ask what their needs are, and engage in the offending party and community members to collectively address the harm. In this research, we conducted interviews and design activities with harmed adolescents to understand their needs to address online harm. They also identified the key stakeholders relevant to their needs, the desired outcomes, and the preferred timing to achieve them. We identified five central needs of harmed adolescents: sensemaking, emotional support and validation, safety, retribution, and transformation. We find that addressing the needs of those who are harmed online usually requires concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders online and offline. We conclude by discussing how platforms can implement design interventions to meet some of these needs.

Monitoring Screen Time or Redesigning It? Two Approaches to Supporting Intentional Social Media Use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517722,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517722,"
 Existing designs helping people manage their social media use include: 1) external supports that monitor and limit use; 2) internal supports that change the interface itself. Here, we design and deploy Chirp, a mobile Twitter client, to independently examine how users experience external and internal supports. To develop Chirp, we identified 16 features that influence users’ sense of agency on Twitter through a survey of 129 participants and a design workshop. We then conducted a four-week within-subjects deployment with 31 participants. Our internal supports (including features to filter tweets and inform users when they have exhausted new content) significantly increased users’ sense of agency, while our external supports (a usage dashboard and nudges to close the app) did not. Participants valued our internal supports and said that our external supports were for “other people.” Our findings suggest that design patterns promoting agency may serve users better than screen time tools.

Undoing Seamlessness: Exploring Seams for Critical Visualization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519703,4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02241,"
While seamful design has been part of discourses and work within HCI contexts for some time, it has not yet been fully explored in data visualization design. At the same time, critics of visualization have been arguing that the representation of data as contextual, contingent, relational, partial, heterogeneous, and situated is currently lacking in visualization. Seamful visualization promises a fresh perspective on visualization design as we seek to find more expressive encodings and novel approaches to representing data that acknowledge their wider qualities and limitations. By consulting seams in other realms and exploring existing seams and seamfulness in visualization, this paper offers a foundation for conceptualizing seamful visualization, points towards the value of seams and seamfulness in critical visualization, and proposes principles for engaging with seamful visualization in practice and research.

It is generally acknowledged that the virtual event platforms of today do not perform satisfactorily at what is arguably their most important function: providing attendees with a sense of social presence. Social presence is the “sense of being with another” and can include ways of knowing who is in the virtual space, how others are reacting to what is happening in the space, an awareness of others’ activities and availability, and an idea of how to connect with them. Issues around presence and awareness have been perennial topics in the CHI and CSCW communities for decades. Nevertheless, the time feels ripe for a new effort with a special focus on larger-scale virtual events, given the accelerated pace of change in the socio-technological landscape and the tremendous potential impact that new insights could now have. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry with a shared interest in improving the experience of virtual events to exchange insights and hopefully energize an ongoing community effort in this area.

Digital fabrication of pneumatic actuators with integrated sensing by machine knitting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517577,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517577,"
 Soft actuators with integrated sensing have shown utility in a variety of applications such as assistive wearables, robotics, and interactive input devices. Despite their promise, these actuators can be difficult to both design and fabricate. As a solution, we present a workflow for computationally designing and digitally fabricating soft pneumatic actuators via a machine knitting process. Machine knitting is attractive as a fabrication process because it is fast, digital (programmable), and provides access to a rich material library of functional yarns for specified mechanical behavior and integrated sensing. Our method uses elastic stitches to construct non-homogeneous knitting structures, which program the bending of actuators when inflated. Our method also integrates pressure and swept frequency capacitive sensing structures using conductive yarns. The entire knitted structure is fabricated automatically in a single machine run. We further provide a computational design interface for the user to interactively preview actuators’ quasi-static shape when authoring elastic stitches. Our sensing-integrated actuators are cost-effective, easy to design, robust to large actuation, and require minimal manual post-processing. We demonstrate five use-cases of our actuators in relevant application settings.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has forced workers around the world to switch their working paradigms from on-site to video-mediated communication. Despite the advantages of videoconferencing, diverse circumstances have prevented people from focusing on their work. One of the most typical problems they face is that various surrounding factors distract them during their meetings. This study focuses on conditions in which remote workers are distracted by factors that disturb, interrupt, or restrict them during their meetings. We aim to explore the various problem situations and user needs. To understand users’ pain points and needs, focus group interviews and participatory design workshops were conducted to learn about participants’ troubled working experiences over the past two years and the solutions they expected. Our study provides a unified framework of distracting factors by which to understand causes of poor user experience and reveals valuable implications to improve videoconferencing experiences.

Methods are fundamental to doing research and can directly impact who is included in scientific advances. Given accessibility research's increasing popularity and pervasive barriers to conducting and participating in research experienced by people with disabilities, it is critical to ask how methods are made accessible. Yet papers rarely describe their methods in detail. This paper reports on 17 interviews with accessibility experts about how they include both facilitators and participants with disabilities in popular user research methods. Our findings offer strategies for anticipating access needs while remaining flexible and responsive to unexpected access barriers. We emphasize the importance of considering accessibility at all stages of the research process, and contextualize access work in recent disability and accessibility literature. We explore how technology or processes could reflect a norm of accessibility. Finally, we discuss how various needs intersect and conflict and offer a practical structure for planning accessible research.

Computational rationality as a theory of interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517739,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517739,"
 How do people interact with computers? This fundamental question was asked by Card, Moran, and Newell in 1983 with a proposition to frame it as a question about human cognition – in other words, as a matter of how information is processed in the mind. Recently, the question has been reframed as one of adaptation: how do people adapt their interaction to the limits imposed by cognition, device design, and environment? The paper synthesizes advances toward an answer within the theoretical framework of computational rationality. The core assumption is that users act in accordance with what is best for them, given the limits imposed by their cognitive architecture and their experience of the task environment. This theory can be expressed in computational models that explain and predict interaction. The paper reviews the theoretical commitments and emerging applications in HCI, and it concludes by outlining a research agenda for future work.

 Computational approaches for user interfaces have been used in adapting interfaces for different modalities, usage scenarios and device form factors, understanding screen semantics for accessibility, task-automation, information extraction, and in assisting interface design. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have drawn considerable attention across HCI and related fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, leading to new ML-based user interface approaches. Similarly, significant progress has been made with more traditional optimization- and planning-based approaches to accommodate the need for adapting UIs for screens with different sizes, orientations and aspect ratios, and in emerging domains such as VR/AR and 3D interfaces. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in all kinds of computational approaches for user interfaces across different sectors as a community, including those who develop algorithms and models and those who build applications, to discuss common issues including the need for resources, opportunities for new applications, design implications for human-AI interaction in this domain, and practical challenges such as user privacy.

Two decades of focus on User Experience has yielded an array of digital technologies that help people experience, understand and share emotions. Although the effects of specific technologies upon emotion have been well studied, less is known about how people actively appropriate and combine the full range of devices, apps and services at their disposal to deliberately manage emotions in everyday life. We conducted a one-week diary study in which 23 adults recorded interactions between their emotions and technology use. They reported using a diverse range of emotion-shaping tools and strategies as part of coping with daily challenges, managing routines, and pursuing work and social goals. We analyse these data in the light of psychological theories of emotion. Our findings point to the significance of digital emotion regulation as a powerful perspective to inform wider debates about the impacts of technology on social and emotional well-being.

 The lived experiences of nonspeaking autistic people are typically not reflected in technology designed to support them. In this paper, we describe insights from nonspeaking autistic people who have learned to communicate by typing and those who support them. We leverage these within an augmented reality communication training prototype. The prototype provides an engaging, personalized learning environment in which a user can systematically develop their pointing skills. Pointing skills combined with elements of language such as spelling can in turn facilitate expressive written communication skills. We describe our requirements elicitation process and provide details about our initial implementation.

Using storytelling approaches we draw on qualitative data from a three-month study of the soma mat and breathing light in four households. We tell stories of people’s becomings in the world as they learn of new possibilities for their somas; and as their somas transform. We show how people drew on their somaesthetic experiences with the prototypes to find their way through troubled times; and how through continued engagement some felt compelled to make transformations in how they live their lives. We discuss the implications for the overarching soma design program, focusing on what is required to design for ways of leading a better life.

Reflection in theory and reflection in practice: An exploration of the gaps in reflection support among personal informatics apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501991,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501991,"
 Personal informatics (PI) systems have been developed to support reflection. While reflection is considered an indispensable activity in PI use, how and when reflection occurs is still under-studied. In this paper, we present an analysis of the interactive features of 123 commercial PI apps, revealing that reflective practices are unevenly supported. The lack of features that encourage user-driven reflection, scaffolding for setting goals and configuring data collection and presentation, and consideration of wider implications stand to limit meaning-making and frustrate nuanced insight generation based on lived experiences. Based on our findings, we discuss how reflection is currently misrepresented in personal informatics tools, identify and characterize the gaps between theoretical research on reflection and interface features in current apps, and offer suggestions about how reflection could be better supported.

"InfraredTags: Embedding Invisible AR Markers and Barcodes Using Low-Cost, Infrared-Based 3D Printing and Imaging Tools",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501951,17,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501951,"
 Existing approaches for embedding unobtrusive tags inside 3D objects require either complex fabrication or high-cost imaging equipment. We present InfraredTags, which are 2D markers and barcodes imperceptible to the naked eye that can be 3D printed as part of objects, and detected rapidly by low-cost near-infrared cameras. We achieve this by printing objects from an infrared-transmitting filament, which infrared cameras can see through, and by having air gaps inside for the tag’s bits, which appear at a different intensity in the infrared image.  We built a user interface that facilitates the integration of common tags (QR codes, ArUco markers) with the object geometry to make them 3D printable as InfraredTags. We also developed a low-cost infrared imaging module that augments existing mobile devices and decodes tags using our image processing pipeline. Our evaluation shows that the tags can be detected with little near-infrared illumination (0.2lux) and from distances as far as 250cm. We demonstrate how our method enables various applications, such as object tracking and embedding metadata for augmented reality and tangible interactions.

Still creepy after all these years: the normalization of affective discomfort in app use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502112,17,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502112,"
 It is not well understood why people continue to use privacy-invasive apps they consider creepy. We conducted a scenario-based study (n = 751) to investigate how the intention to use an app is influenced by affective perceptions and privacy concerns. We show that creepiness is one facet of affective discomfort, which is becoming normalized in app use. We found that affective discomfort can be negatively associated with the intention to use a privacy-invasive app. However, the influence is mitigated by other factors, including data literacy, views regarding app data practices, and ambiguity of the privacy threat. Our findings motivate a focus on affective discomfort when designing user experiences related to privacy-invasive data practices. Treating affective discomfort as a fundamental aspect of user experience requires scaling beyond the point where the thumb meets the screen and accounting for entrenched data practices and the sociotechnical landscape within which the practices are embedded.

Strategies for Fostering a Genuine Feeling of Connection in Technologically Mediated Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517580,16,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ekaterina-Stepanova-12/publication/359909549_Strategies_for_Fostering_a_Genuine_Feeling_of_Connection_in_Technologically_Mediated_Systems/links/625812a61c096a380d03bb25/Strategies-for-Fostering-a-Genuine-Feeling-of-Connection-in-Technologically-Mediated-Systems.pdf,"
Human connection is essential for our personal well-being and a building block for a well-functioning society. There is a prominent interest in the potential of technology for mediating social connection, with a wealth of systems designed to foster the feeling of connection between strangers, friends, and family. By surveying this design landscape we present a transitional definition of mediated genuine connection and nine design strategies embodied within 50 design artifacts: affective self-disclosure, reflection on unity, shared embodied experience, transcendent emotions, embodied metaphors, interpersonal distance, touch, provocations, and play. In addition to drawing on design practice-based knowledge we also identify underlying psychological theories that can inform these strategies. We discuss design considerations pertaining to sensory modalities, vulnerability–comfort trade-offs, consent, situatedness in context, supporting diverse relationships, reciprocity, attention directedness, pursuing generalized knowledge, and questions of ethics. We hope to inspire and enrich designers’ understanding of the possibilities of technology to better support a mediated genuine feeling of connection.

SoRoCAD: A Design Tool for the Building Blocks of Pneumatic Soft Robotics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519770,4,https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/publications/brocker2022a.pdf,"
 Soft robotics uses soft, flexible materials and elastic actuation mechanisms to create systems that are more adaptable and tolerant to unknown environments, and safer for human-machine interaction, than rigid robots. Pneumatic soft robots can be fabricated using more affordable materials compared to traditional robots and make use of technologies such as 3D printing, making them an attractive choice for research and DIY projects. However, their design is still highly unintuitive, and at up to two days, design iterations can take prohibitively long: The behavior of, e.g., a pneumatic silicone gripper only becomes apparent after designing and 3D printing its mold, casting, curing, assembling, and testing it. We introduce SoRoCAD, a design tool supporting a Maker-friendly soft robotics design and fabrication pipeline that incorporates simulating the final actuation into the design process.

Above and beyond: A scoping review of domains and applications for human-drone interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501881,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501881,"
Interacting with flying objects has fueled people’s imagination throughout history. Over the past decade, the Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) community has been working towards making this dream a reality. Despite notable findings, we lack a high-level perspective on the current and future use cases for interacting with drones. We present a holistic view of domains and applications of use that are described, studied, and envisioned in the HDI body of work. To map the extent and nature of the prior research, we performed a scoping review (N=217). We identified 16 domains and over 100 applications where drones and people interact together. We then describe in depth the main domains and applications reported in the literature and further present under-explored use cases with great potential. We conclude with fundamental challenges and opportunities for future research in the field. This work contributes a systematic step towards increased replicability and generalizability of HDI research.

ReClaym our Compost: Biodegradable Clay for Intimate Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517711,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517711,"
In this work, we use composted food waste to create ReClaym: a personal biomaterial, made at home, that reflects the makers’ relationship with food. We combine our personal compost with non-toxic binders to create a biomaterial that can completely biodegrade. We propose Intimate Making as an approach for working with ReClaym that leverages familiar, hands-on techniques to enhance maker-material communication, which in turn leads to a deeper material understanding. We explore methods to customize ReClaym via color, texture, sensing, and conductivity. We apply manual fabrication techniques (sculpting, molding, and hand-held extruding) and design explorations to create a collection of applications that include garden paraphernalia, games, and personal items found in the home. We then examine the entire life cycle of ReClaym, which both begins and ends with composting—giving food waste a second life and providing a sustainable end of life for ReClaym artifacts, thus making the process truly circular.

Motivational and situational aspects of active and passive social media breaks may explain the difference between recovery and procrastination,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519643,3,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10146846/3/Hossain_acm_lbw_submission_RPS_version.pdf,"
Students frequently multitask with social media (SM) during self-study. Such social media multitasking (SMM) has the potential either to support wellbeing by acting as a recovery activity or subvert it by acting as a procrastination activity. It is currently unclear which specific SM behaviours and related factors push SMM towards recovery or procrastination. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 undergraduates to explore which SMM behaviours and factors led to recovery or procrastination. We found that both active and passive SM breaks have the potential to be recovery or procrastination activities. Whether a SM break becomes a recovery or procrastination activity partly depends on its automaticity and situational SM factors. This paper contributes empirical evidence that supports emerging criticism of an existing simplistic understanding of the relationship between active/passive SM use and wellbeing, and demonstrates how a richer model can inform the design of technologies that support better SM breaks.

Demonstrating InfraredTags: Decoding Invisible 3D Printed Tags with Convolutional Neural Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519905,4,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146136/3491101.3519905.pdf?sequence=1,"
 We demonstrate InfraredTags, which are invisible 2D markers and barcodes that are 3D printed as part of objects. We show how InfraredTags can be decoded using a convolutional neural network (CNN) after being captured by low-cost near-infrared cameras. InfraredTags are formed by printing objects from an infrared-transmitting filament, which infrared cameras can see through, and by having air gaps inside for the tag’s bits, which appear at a different intensity in the infrared image. We built a user interface that facilitates the integration of common tags (QR codes, ArUco markers) with the object geometry to make them 3D printable as InfraredTags. Once printed, the tags can be robustly decoded with a U-Net model that we trained using a custom dataset for optimal binarization and detection. We show how our method enables different applications, such as object tracking and embedding metadata for tangible interactions and augmented reality.

Glancee: An adaptable system for instructors to grasp student learning status in synchronous online classes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517482,12,https://shuaima.cc/personal_webpage_files/paper_pdf/glancee.pdf,"
 Synchronous online learning has become a trend in recent years. However, instructors often face the challenge of inferring audiences’ reactions and learning status without seeing their faces in video feeds, which prevents instructors from establishing connections with students. To solve this problem, based on a need-finding survey with 67 college instructors, we propose Glancee, a real-time interactive system with adaptable configurations, sidebar-based visual displays, and comprehensive learning status detection algorithms. Then, we conduct a within-subject user study in which 18 college instructors deliver lectures online with Glancee and two baselines, EngageClass and ZoomOnly. Results show that Glancee can effectively support online teaching and is perceived to be significantly more helpful than the baselines. We further investigate how instructors’ emotions, behaviors, attention, cognitive load, and trust are affected during the class. Finally, we offer design recommendations for future online teaching assistant systems.

The role of staff in facilitating immersive virtual reality for enrichment in aged care: an ethic of care perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501956,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501956,"
Immersive virtual reality (VR) is being used as an enriching experience for people living in residential aged care, or nursing homes, where care staff play a critical role supporting clients to use VR. In HCI research concerned with technology use in aged care, however, the role of formal caregivers has received limited attention. We conducted interviews with 11 caregivers working in care homes that have implemented VR as part of the social program offered to residents. Our findings highlight tensions between the opportunities created by the immersive VR experience and the risks and challenges full immersion presents for people in aged care. In this paper, we draw on an ethics of care framework to make visible the care practices involved in facilitating VR in aged care homes, highlighting the care required to ensure that older adults experience benefits when using immersive VR, while risks and challenges are carefully managed.

Caught in the network: the impact of WhatsApp's 2021 privacy policy update on users' messaging app ecosystems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502032,14,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502032,"
In January 2021, WhatsApp announced an update to their privacy policy, sparking an outcry that saw millions of users install other messaging apps such as Telegram and Signal. This presented a rare opportunity to study users’ experiences when trying to leave the world’s most popular communication app. We conducted surveys in February and May with 1525 WhatsApp users from Mexico, Spain, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Over a quarter wanted to switch at least part of their communication to other apps, but 74% of them failed to do so. By May, 27% had increased their use of other apps, and only 16% used WhatsApp less. Beyond network effects, users struggled with making informed choices of alternative apps and with differences in their design and functionality. We suggest messaging interoperability as an approach to alleviate switching costs and discuss implications for HCI research and competition regulation of digital services.

Menstrual monster: a tangible interactive co-educational game designed for teenagers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519723,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/y3hxs2tqzzcmfjbowjfnm3rose/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519723,"
Learning menstruation in early adolescence could reduce teenagers’ misunderstanding of it and help them treat menstruation in a proper way. This paper explored a tangible game for teenagers of different genders learning menstruation through collaborative playing. The game included five levels where users play together and learn the cause, products, symptoms of menstruation as well as try to judge some scenarios and listen to audios about menstruation. In our user study, we invited three groups of teenagers ages 11 to 16. Each group contained at least one male and one female, and we let them play the game freely. Teenagers were successfully able to play the game collaboratively, learn menstruation-related knowledge. The results revealed motivation differences related to gender, and after the game, teenagers demonstrated the observable change of the attitude towards menstruation.

A Case Study of Integrating Fairness Visualization Tools in Machine Learning Education,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503568,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/ebiipgh37za3rg7faxhuqkjhii/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503568,"
As demonstrated by media attention and research, Artificial Intelligence systems are not adequately addressing issues of fairness and bias, and more education on these topics is needed in industry and higher education. Currently, computer science courses that cover AI fairness and bias focus on statistical analysis or, on the other hand, attempt to bring in philosophical perspectives that lack actionable takeaways for students. Based on long-standing pedagogical research demonstrating the importance of using tools and visualizations to reinforce student learning, this case study reports on the impacts of using publicly-available visualization tools used in HCI practice as a resource for students examining algorithmic fairness concepts. Through qualitative review and observations of four focus groups, we examined six open-source fairness tools that enable students to visualize, quantify and explore algorithmic biases. The findings of this study provide insights into the benefits, challenges, and opportunities of integrating fairness tools as part of machine learning education.

MobileTutAR: a Lightweight Augmented Reality Tutorial System using Spatially Situated Human Segmentation Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519639,4,https://scholar.archive.org/work/xowb44bzrjeefbttzclbanmsv4/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519639,"
 Augmented reality (AR) tutorial systems have a strong potential to help workers improve learning efficiency in the ongoing trend of Industry 4.0. The current state-of-the-art point cloud approach usually requires cumbersome preparation and additional computational resources only to suffer from low-resolution visual results. To overcome the above limitations, we propose MobileTutAR, a lightweight AR tutorial system that runs entirely on mobile devices providing high definition spatially situated tutorial videos. Our approach captures the tutorial images that extract a human’s body segmentation combined with a user-defined area of interest. The system then projects the tutoring content spatially in situ, to align with the human expert’s recorded position. When playing back, the learner is guided by a navigation-centered user interface to observe the segmentation video from the recorder’s original position/orientation. In this way, we deliver a high-definition AR experience without needing any cumbersome equipment, exotic computational resources, or in-depth training.

Shared user interfaces of physiological data: systematic review of social biofeedback systems and contexts in hci,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517495,15,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00720,"
As an emerging interaction paradigm, physiological computing is increasingly being used to both measure and feed back information about our internal psychophysiological states. While most applications of physiological computing are designed for individual use, recent research has explored how biofeedback can be socially shared between multiple users to augment human-human communication. Reflecting on the empirical progress in this area of study, this paper presents a systematic review of 64 studies to characterize the interaction contexts and effects of social biofeedback systems. Our findings highlight the importance of physio-temporal and social contextual factors surrounding physiological data sharing as well as how it can promote social-emotional competences on three different levels: intrapersonal, interpersonal, and task-focused. We also present the Social Biofeedback Interactions framework to articulate the current physiological-social interaction space. We use this to frame our discussion of the implications and ethical considerations for future research and design of social biofeedback interfaces.

 HCI researchers have been gradually shifting attention from individual users to communities when engaging in research, design, and system development. However, our field has yet to establish a cohesive, systematic understanding of the challenges, benefits, and commitments of community-collaborative approaches to research. We conducted a systematic review and thematic analysis of 47 computing research papers discussing participatory research with communities for the development of technological artifacts and systems, published over the last two decades. From this review, we identified seven themes associated with the evolution of a project: from establishing community partnerships to sustaining results. Our findings suggest that several tensions characterize these projects, many of which relate to the power and position of researchers, and the computing research environment, relative to community partners. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer methodological proposals to guide HCI, and computing research more broadly, towards practices that center communities.

 Cycling has become increasingly popular as a means of transportation. However, cyclists remain a highly vulnerable group of road users. According to accident reports, one of the most dangerous situations for cyclists are uncontrolled intersections, where cars approach from both directions. To address this issue and assist cyclists in crossing decision-making at uncontrolled intersections, we designed two visualizations that: (1) highlight occluded cars through an X-ray vision and (2) depict the remaining time the intersection is safe to cross via a Countdown. To investigate the efficiency of these visualizations, we proposed an Augmented Reality simulation as a novel evaluation method, in which the above visualizations are represented as AR, and conducted a controlled experiment with 24 participants indoors. We found that the X-ray ensures a fast selection of shorter gaps between cars, while the Countdown facilitates a feeling of safety and provides a better intersection overview.

 Data-driven approaches that form the foundation of advancements in machine learning (ML) are powered in large part by human infrastructures that enable the collection of large datasets. We study the movement of data through multiple stages of data processing in the context of public health in India, examining the data work performed by frontline health workers, data stewards, and ML developers. We conducted interviews with these stakeholders to understand their varied perspectives on valuing data across stages, working with data to attain this value, and challenges arising throughout. We discuss the tensions in valuing and how they might be addressed, as we emphasize the need for improved transparency and accountability when data are transformed from one stage of processing to the next.

 This paper responds to sustainable HCI’s call to design long-term participatory projects with grassroots communities to counter the local effects of climate change and support more viable practices. We contribute a methodological approach to participatory speculative design as a series of interrelated experiments in living, working in symbiosis with a food-growing community moving towards collective resilience and food sovereignty. As an example of sustainability research within HCI, community food-growing has predominantly focused on collaborative acts of growing rather than disagreements, divergences and frictions. Limited attention has been paid to the challenges of effectively negotiating collaborative, sustainable speculative futures in this context. This paper reports on a workshop series on sustainable community food-growing using situated participatory speculation to address potential tensions when working collaboratively towards socio-technical alternatives.

Are You Tired? I am: Trying to Understand Privacy Fatigue of Social Media Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519778,3,,"
 Privacy fatigue is a new perspective to explain the discrepancy between individual attitude and behavior, i.e., privacy paradox. Fatigued users are powerless about privacy decisions, and thus ”forced to accept” or ”regardless of it”. In order to understand social media users’ privacy fatigue comprehensively, we use China’s mainstream social media Weibo as the background to conduct experiments on 428 users. Specifically, we propose and verify the perceived antecedents and behavioral consequences of the privacy fatigue model based on the Stimulus Organism Response (S-O-R) theory, taking personality traits as the moderating factor. Based on collectivist culture, the study provides complementary evidence to existing research on cultural factors. We hope it will enrich the privacy fatigue theory, helping researchers and service providers pay attention to users’ potential fatigue and implement usable privacy design in real systems to alleviate privacy fatigue.

 Our everyday technologies evidence clear examples of racial bias. Rather than attempt to eliminate bias through seeking fairness in algorithms, regulatory intervention or a race-blind stance, this paper seeks to correct the balance by adopting an explictly anti-racist approach to the design of sociotechnical systems. As a research-through-design initiative, we bring techniques from critical technical practice to bear on revealing and inverting assumptions in HCI, attempting to produce alternative sociotechnical systems that aim not merely to reveal or correct but to destablize or dismantle systems of oppression. We articulate core principles to guide such work and articulate four system prototypes to interrogate anti-racist HCI as a potential form of critical technical practice. We conclude with discussion of the challenges that face anti-racist HCI in terms of timing, reflection, and failure, addressing what an anti-racist critical technical practice reveals about the enduring structural sources of inequity in the products and practices of HCI.

“Look! It'sa computer program! It's an algorithm! It's AI!”: Does terminology affect human perceptions and evaluations of algorithmic decision-making systems?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517527,20,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517527,"
In the media, in policy-making, but also in research articles, algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems are referred to as algorithms, artificial intelligence, and computer programs, amongst other terms. We hypothesize that such terminological differences can affect people’s perceptions of properties of ADM systems, people’s evaluations of systems in application contexts, and the replicability of research as findings may be influenced by terminological differences. In two studies (N = 397, N = 622), we show that terminology does indeed affect laypeople’s perceptions of system properties (e.g., perceived complexity) and evaluations of systems (e.g., trust). Our findings highlight the need to be mindful when choosing terms to describe ADM systems, because terminology can have unintended consequences, and may impact the robustness and replicability of HCI research. Additionally, our findings indicate that terminology can be used strategically (e.g., in communication about ADM systems) to influence people’s perceptions and evaluations of these systems.

With increased automation levels of vehicle technology, human involvement is expected to be transformed from a driver towards an operator role. This transition will entail remote monitoring and possibilities for intervention of driverless vehicle fleets. Thus far, there are insufficient tools available for user interface development and experimentation, which renders it difficult to quickly devise, prototype, and test solutions to support operators in their specific work contexts. We present the TeleOperationStation, an extended-reality experience prototyping environment, which coherently simulates automated fleet operation workflows, covering non-driving tasks, monitoring, takeover requests, and full remote vehicle operation. During this interactive demonstration, on-site and online conference participants will be enabled to experience and co-create user interfaces for remote automated vehicle operation, using AR from a first-person viewpoint, and controlling a physical miniature vehicle.

 Feedforward is a training technique where people observe themselves perform a new skill to promote rapid learning, commonly implemented via video self-modelling. Avatars provide a unique opportunity to self-model skills an individual’s physical self cannot yet perform. We investigated the use of avatars in video-based learning and explore the potential of feedforward learning from self-avatars. Using modern dancing as a skill to learn, we compared the user experience when learning from a human training video and an avatar training video, considering both self-avatars (n=8) and gender-matched generic avatars (n=8). Our results indicate that learning from avatars can improve the user experience over learning from a human in a video, providing attentional and motivational benefits. Furthermore, self-avatars make the training more relatable and immersive than generic avatars. We discuss the implications from this preliminary work, highlighting methodological considerations for feedforward learning from avatars and promising future work.

 Future offices are likely reshaped by Augmented Reality (AR) extending the display space while maintaining awareness of surroundings, and thus promise to support collaborative tasks such as brainstorming or sensemaking. However, it is unclear how physical surroundings and co-located collaboration influence the spatial organization of virtual content for sensemaking. Therefore, we conducted a study (N=28) to investigate the effect of office environments and work styles during a document classification task using AR with regard to content placement, layout strategies, and sensemaking workflows. Results show that participants require furniture, especially tables and whiteboards, to assist sensemaking and collaboration regardless of room settings, while generous free spaces (e.g., walls) are likely used when available. Moreover, collaborating participants tend to use furniture despite personal layout preferences. We identified different placement and layout strategies, as well as the transitions in-between. Finally, we propose design implications for future immersive sensemaking applications and beyond.

With the advancements in AI, agents (i.e., smart products, robots, software agents) are increasingly capable of working closely together with humans in a variety of ways while benefiting from each other. These human-agent collaborations have gained growing attention in the HCI community; however, the field lacks clear guidelines on how to design the agents’ behaviors in collaborations. In this paper, the qualities that are relevant for designers to create robust and pleasant human-agent collaborations were investigated. Bratman's Shared Cooperative Activity framework was used to identify the core characteristics of collaborations and survey the most important issues in the design of human-agent collaborations, namely code-of-conduct, task delegation, autonomy and control, intelligibility, common ground, offering help and requesting help. The aim of this work is to add structure to this growing and important facet of HCI research and operationalize the concept of human-agent collaboration with concrete design considerations.

"“In this online environment, we're limited”: Exploring Inclusive Video Conferencing Design for Signers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517488,14,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517488,"
As video conferencing (VC) has become increasingly necessary for many aspects of daily life, many d/Deaf and hard of hearing people, particularly those who communicate via sign language (signers), face distinct accessibility barriers. To better understand the unique requirements for participating in VC using a visual-gestural language, such as ASL, and to identify practical design considerations for signer-inclusive videoconferencing, we conducted 12 interviews and four co-design sessions with a total of eight d/Deaf signers and eight ASL interpreters. We found that participants’ access needs regarding consuming information (e.g., visual clarity of signs), communicating (e.g., getting attention of others), and collaborating (e.g., working with interpreter teams) are not well-met on existing VC platforms. We share novel insights into attending and conducting signer-accessible video conferences, outline considerations for future VC design, and provide guidelines for conducting remote research with d/Deaf signers.

Improving the Discoverability of Interactions in Interactive Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503813,4,https://inria.hal.science/hal-03927344/file/CHIDC2022-Mackamul-NoCopyright.pdf,"
 In an ever increasingly complex technological landscape, interaction methods need to support users in their own discovery. This is exacerbated by a general aversion to instruction manuals and a trend towards invisible controls. Consequently, a lack of support for awareness or recognition of interaction possibilities leads to inefficient usage or complete disregard of the system. However, despite standard work imploring that users should be able to “figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them”, this problem is rarely considered in the introduction of new interaction methods. My doctoral research is focused on improving the discovery of interaction possibilities. To do so I am combining a theoretical approach, focused on identifying, defining and framing relevant considerations with a practical approach to validate those theoretical considerations and identify and formulate actionable improvement methods for researchers and designers. In the process I hope to highlight the importance of discoverability to the research community and advocate for its increased consideration.

Designing fair AI in human resource management: Understanding tensions surrounding algorithmic evaluation and envisioning stakeholder-centered solutions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517672,17,,"
Enterprises have recently adopted AI to human resource management (HRM) to evaluate employees’ work performance evaluation. However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1) divergent perspectives on fairness, 2) the accuracy of AI, 3) the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4) the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5) the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity. We present stakeholder-centered design ideas for solutions to mitigate these tensions and further discuss how to promote harmony among various stakeholders at the workplace.

Paper trail: An immersive authoring system for augmented reality instructional experiences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517486,13,https://shwetharajaram.github.io/paper-pdfs/papertrail-chi22.pdf,"
Prior work has demonstrated augmented reality’s benefits to education, but current tools are difficult to integrate with traditional instructional methods. We present Paper Trail, an immersive authoring system designed to explore how to enable instructors to create AR educational experiences, leaving paper at the core of the interaction and enhancing it with various forms of digital media, animations for dynamic illustrations, and clipping masks to guide learning. To inform the system design, we developed five scenarios exploring the benefits that hand-held and head-worn AR can bring to STEM instruction and developed a design space of AR interactions enhancing paper based on these scenarios and prior work. Using the example of an AR physics handout, we assessed the system’s potential with PhD-level instructors and its usability with XR design experts. In an elicitation study with high-school teachers, we study how Paper Trail could be used and extended to enable flexible use cases across various domains. We discuss benefits of immersive paper for supporting diverse student needs and challenges for making effective use of AR for learning.

Great chain of agents: The role of metaphorical representation of agents in conversational crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517653,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517653,"
Conversational agents are being widely adopted across several domains to serve a variety of purposes ranging from providing intelligent assistance to companionship. Recent literature has shown that users develop intuitive folk theories and a metaphorical understanding of conversational agents (CAs) due to the lack of a mental model of the agents. However, investigation of metaphorical agent representation in the HCI community has mainly focused on the human level, despite non-human metaphors for agents being prevalent in the real world. We adopted Lakoff and Turner’s ‘Great Chain of Being’ framework to systematically investigate the impact of using non-human metaphors to represent conversational agents on worker engagement in crowdsourcing marketplaces. We designed a text-based conversational agent that assists crowd workers in task execution. Through a between-subjects experimental study (N = 341), we explored how different human and non-human metaphors affect worker engagement, the perceived cognitive load of workers, intrinsic motivation, and their trust in the agents. Our findings bridge the gap of how users experience CAs with non-human metaphors in the context of conversational crowdsourcing.

Family Learning Talk in AI Literacy Learning Activities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502091,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502091,"
 The unique role that AI plays in making decisions that affect human lives creates a need to foster improved public understanding of AI systems. Informal learning spaces are particularly important contexts for fostering AI literacy, as they have the potential to reach a broader audience and provide spaces for children and parents to learn together. This paper explores 1) what types of dialogue family groups engage in when learning about AI in an at-home learning environment in order to inform our understanding of 2) how to design AI literacy activities for informal learning contexts. We present an analysis of family group dialogue surrounding three different AI education activities and use our findings to reflect on, update, and add to existing principles for designing AI literacy educational interventions.

Reducing virtual reality sickness for cyclists in VR bicycle simulators,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501959,13,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrii-Matviienko/publication/358609229_Reducing_Virtual_Reality_Sickness_for_Cyclists_in_VR_Bicycle_Simulators/links/620b7c5687866404a16b91df/Reducing-Virtual-Reality-Sickness-for-Cyclists-in-VR-Bicycle-Simulators.pdf,"
 Virtual Reality (VR) bicycle simulations aim to recreate the feeling of riding a bicycle and are commonly used in many application areas. However, current solutions still create mismatches between the visuals and physical movement, which causes VR sickness and diminishes the cycling experience. To reduce VR sickness in bicycle simulators, we conducted two controlled lab experiments addressing two main causes of VR sickness: (1) steering methods and (2) cycling trajectory. In the first experiment (N = 18) we compared handlebar, HMD, and upper-body steering methods. In the second experiment (N = 24) we explored three types of movement in VR (1D, 2D, and 3D trajectories) and three countermeasures (airflow, vibration, and dynamic Field-of-View) to reduce VR sickness. We found that handlebar steering leads to the lowest VR sickness without decreasing cycling performance and airflow suggests to be the most promising method to reduce VR sickness for all three types of trajectories.

Recruiting participants with programming skills: A comparison of four crowdsourcing platforms and a CS student mailing list,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501957,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501957,"
 Reliably recruiting participants with programming skills is an ongoing challenge for empirical studies involving software development technologies, often leading to the use of crowdsourcing platforms and computer science (CS) students. In this work, we use five existing survey instruments to explore the programming skills, privacy and security attitudes, and secure development self-efficacy of participants from a CS student mailing list and four crowdsourcing platforms (Appen, Clickworker, MTurk, and Prolific). We recruited 613 participants who claimed to have programming skills and assessed recruitment channels regarding costs, quality, programming skills, as well as privacy and security attitudes. We find that 27% of crowdsourcing participants, 40% of crowdsourcing participants who self-report to be developers, and 89% of CS students answered all programming skill questions correctly. CS students were the most cost-effective recruitment channel and rated themselves lower than crowdsourcing participants about secure development self-efficacy.

Are deepfakes concerning? analyzing conversations of deepfakes on reddit and exploring societal implications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517446,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517446,"
 Deepfakes are synthetic content generated using advanced deep learning and AI technologies. The advancement of technology has created opportunities for anyone to create and share deepfakes much easier. This may lead to societal concerns based on how communities engage with it. However, there is limited research available to understand how communities perceive deepfakes. We examined deepfake conversations on Reddit from 2018 to 2021—including major topics and their temporal changes as well as implications of these conversations. Using a mixed-method approach—topic modeling and qualitative coding, we found 6,638 posts and 86,425 comments discussing concerns of the believable nature of deepfakes and how platforms moderate them. We also found Reddit conversations to be pro-deepfake and building a community that supports creating and sharing deepfake artifacts and building a marketplace regardless of the consequences. Possible implications derived from qualitative codes indicate that deepfake conversations raise societal concerns. We propose that there are implications for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to mitigate the harm created from deepfakes.

Transparent practices for quantitative empirical research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503760,4,https://osf.io/2dnq7/download,"
Transparent research practices enable the research design, materials, analytic methods, and data to be thoroughly evaluated and potentially reproduced. The HCI community has recognized research transparency as one quality aspect of paper submission and review since CHI 2021. This course addresses HCI researchers and students who are already knowledgeable about experiment research design and statistical analysis. Building upon this knowledge, we will present current best practices and tools for increasing research transparency. We will cover relevant concepts and skills in Open Science, frequentist statistics, and Bayesian statistics, and uncertainty visualization. In addition to lectures, there will be hands-on exercises: The course participants will assess transparency practices in excerpts of quantitative reports, interactively explore implications of analytical choices using RStudio Cloud, and discuss their findings in small groups. In the final session, each participant will choose a case study based on their interest and assess its research transparency together with their classmates and instructors.

StoryDrawer: A Child–AI Collaborative Drawing System to Support Children's Creative Visual Storytelling,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501914,14,,"
Visual storytelling is a new approach to creative expression based on verbal and figural creativity. The keys to visual storytelling are narrating and drawing over a period of time, which can be beneficial but also demanding on creativity for children. Informed by need-finding investigations, we developed StoryDrawer, a co-creative system that supports visual storytelling for children aged 6–10 years through collaborative drawing between children and artificial intelligence (AI). The system includes a context-based voice agent and two AI-driven collaborative strategies: the real-time transformation of children's telling into drawings, and the generation of abstract sketches with semantic similarity to existing story content. We conducted a 2 × 2 study with 64 children to evaluate the efficacy of StoryDrawer by varying the two strategies in four conditions. The results suggest that StoryDrawer provoked participants’ creative and elaborate ideas and contributed to their creative outcomes during an engaging visual storytelling experience.

Ai in your mind: Counterbalancing perceived agency and experience in human-ai interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519833,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/sv7khqdmivccfdtfxujs64eogy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519833,"
 In this mixed-methods study, we attempt to capture users’ conception of AI through the two-dimensional mind perception framework (perceived agency vs. experience) in cognitive psychology [13] and a series of drawing tasks. Our data illustrate how participants perceive AI entities with physical embodiment, depicting AI through devices, imaginary human figures, or full techno-ecosystems. Furthermore, we apply users’ mind maps of AI entities to highlight risks in human-AI interaction (HAII) and propose design solutions accordingly. We posit HAII research and development should be cognizant that users possess existing AI images and should exploit them as starting points for design improvement.

Crossdata: Leveraging text-data connections for authoring data documents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517485,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517485,"
 Data documents play a central role in recording, presenting, and disseminating data. Despite the proliferation of applications and systems designed to support the analysis, visualization, and communication of data, writing data documents remains a laborious process, requiring a constant back-and-forth between data processing and writing tools. Interviews with eight professionals revealed that their workflows contained numerous tedious, repetitive, and error-prone operations. The key issue that we identified is the lack of persistent connection between text and data. Thus, we developed CrossData, a prototype that treats text-data connections as persistent, interactive, first-class objects. By automatically identifying, establishing, and leveraging text-data connections, CrossData enables rich interactions to assist in the authoring of data documents. An expert evaluation with eight users demonstrated the usefulness of CrossData, showing that it not only reduced the manual effort in writing data documents but also opened new possibilities to bridge the gap between data exploration and writing.

“Brush it Off”: How Women Workers Manage and Cope with Bias and Harassment in Gender-agnostic Gig Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517524,16,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ning-Ma-52/publication/359802513_Brush_it_Of_How_Women_Workers_Manage_and_Cope_with_Bias_and_Harassment_in_Gender-agnostic_Gig_Platforms_Brush_it_Of_How_Women_Workers_Manage_and_Cope_with_Bias_and_Harassment_in_Gender-agnostic_Gig/links/624f47594f88c3119ce7102c/Brush-it-Of-How-Women-Workers-Manage-and-Cope-with-Bias-and-Harassment-in-Gender-agnostic-Gig-Platforms-Brush-it-Of-How-Women-Workers-Manage-and-Cope-with-Bias-and-Harassment-in-Gender-agnostic-Gig.pdf,"
Women make up approximately half of the workforce in ride-hailing, food delivery, and home service platforms in North America. While studies have reported that gig workers face bias, harassment, and a gender pay gap, we have limited understanding of women’s perspectives of these issues and their coping mechanisms. We interviewed 20 women gig workers to hear their unique experiences with these challenges. We found that gig platforms are gender-agnostic, meaning they do not acknowledge women’s experiences and the value they bring. By not enforcing anti-harassment policies in design, gig platforms also leave women workers vulnerable to bias and harassment. Due to the lack of support for immediate actions and in fear of losing access to work, women workers “brush off” harassment. In addition, the platforms’ dispatching and recommendation mechanisms do not acknowledge women’s contributions in perceived safety for customers and social support for peer workers.

Informing housing policy through web automation: Lessons for designing programming tools for domain experts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503575,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/4tl7nz7umvg5ldad6s7t75xn6a/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503575,"
 Housing costs have risen dramatically in the past decade, surpassing their pre-Recession levels, but the data that housing researchers and policymakers rely on to understand these dynamics remain subject to important limitations in their spatiotemporal granularity or methodological transparency. While these aspects of existing public and private data sources present barriers to understanding the geography of cost and availability in markets across the United States, web data about housing opportunities provide an important alternative—albeit one that demands technical skills that would-be data users may lack. This case study documents the experiences of a collaboration between social and computer scientists focused on using a novel programming-by-demonstration tool for web automation, Helena, to inform rental housing policy and inequalities in the United States. While this project was initially focused on collecting housing ads from a single site within the Seattle area, the capacity to scale our project to new sources and locations afforded by Helena’s human-centered design allowed a team of social scientists to progress to scraping data across the country and multiple platforms. Using this project as a case study, we discuss a.) important programming and research challenges that were encountered and b.) how Helena’s design helped us overcome these barriers to using scraped web data in basic research and policy analysis.

Human-GDPR interaction: practical experiences of accessing personal data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501947,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501947,"
In our data-centric world, most services rely on collecting and using personal data. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aims to enhance individuals’ control over their data, but its practical impact is not well understood. We present a 10-participant study, where each participant filed 4-5 data access requests. Through interviews accompanying these requests and discussions scrutinising returned data, it appears that GDPR falls short of its goals due to non-compliance and low-quality responses. Participants found their hopes to understand providers’ data practices or harness their own data unmet. This causes increased distrust without any subjective improvement in power, although more transparent providers do earn greater trust. We propose designing more effective, data-inclusive and open policies and data access systems to improve both customer relations and individual agency, and also that wider public use of GDPR rights could help with delivering accountability and motivating providers to improve data practices.

Physicalizing sustainable development goals data: an example with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy),https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519638,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519638,"
 In 2015, all members of the United Nations adopted the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development (SD). Seventeen (17) goals (SDGs) were formulated towards peace and prosperity for people and the planet. However, concerns have been raised about whether these sustainable goals can be achieved by 2030. Communicating advances regarding SDGs to citizens in an effective and engaging way is thus crucial, as it can reveal which goals need more attention and prompt them to think about what to do at an individual level to support SDG progress. Physicalizations present an opportunity in this context and the overall goal of this work is to empirically articulate the merits of different strategies to convey SDG data physically. We created a data physicalization that uses vibration and temperature as modalities to convey facts related to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). Vibration and temperature was chosen to aim for reducing the metaphorical distance between the data and the representation (i.e. to align the quality of data with quality of representation). In a preliminary evaluation, both modalities were perceived as enjoyable by the participants. The two modalities were efficient, however, vibration as a modality was more effective. Temperature, despite presenting a lower metaphorical distance, did not appear to be an effective modality to convey SDG information.

Designing for the bittersweet: Improving sensitive experiences with recommender systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502049,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502049,"
It is difficult to design systems that honor the complex and often contradictory emotions that can be surfaced by sensitive encounters with recommender systems. To explore the design and ethical considerations in this space, we interviewed 20 people who had recently seen sensitive content through Facebook’s Memories feature. Interviewees typically described how (1) expectedness, (2) context of viewing, and (3) what we describe as “affective sense-making” were important factors for how they perceived “bittersweet” content, a sensitizing concept from our interviews that we expand upon. To address these user needs, we pose provocations to support critical work in this area and we suggest that researchers and designers: (1) draw inspiration from no/low-technology artifacts, (2) use empirical research to identify contextual features that have negative impacts on users, and (3) conduct user studies on affective sense-making.  CAUTION: This paper discusses difficult subject matter related to death and relationships.

We present AirRacket, perceptual modeling and design of ungrounded, directional force feedback for virtual racket sports. Using compressed air propulsion jets to provide directional impact forces, we iteratively designed for three popular sports that span a wide range of force magnitudes: ping-pong, badminton, and tennis. To address the limited force magnitude of ungrounded force feedback technologies, we conducted a perception study which discovered the novel illusion that users perceive larger impact force magnitudes with longer impact duration, by an average factor of 2.57x. Through a series of formative, perceptual, and user experience studies with a combined total of 72 unique participants, we explored several perceptual designs using force magnitude scaling and duration scaling methods to expand the dynamic range of perceived force magnitude. Our user experience evaluation showed that perceptual designs can significantly improve realism and preference vs. physics-based designs for ungrounded force feedback systems.

The effect of the vergence-accommodation conflict on virtual hand pointing in immersive displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502067,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502067,"
 Previous work hypothesized that for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) displays a mismatch between disparities and optical focus cues, known as the vergence and accommodation conflict (VAC), affects depth perception and thus limits user performance in 3D selection tasks within arm’s reach (peri-personal space). To investigate this question, we built a multifocal stereo display, which can eliminate the influence of the VAC for pointing within the investigated distances. In a user study, participants performed a virtual hand 3D selection task with targets arranged laterally or along the line of sight, with and without a change in visual depth, in display conditions with and without the VAC. Our results show that the VAC influences 3D selection performance in common VR and AR stereo displays and that multifocal displays have a positive effect on 3D selection performance with a virtual hand.

The unboxing experience: Exploration and design of initial interactions between children and social robots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501955,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501955,"
Social robots are increasingly introduced into children’s lives as educational and social companions, yet little is known about how these products might best be introduced to their environments. The emergence of the “unboxing” phenomenon in media suggests that introduction is key to technology adoption where initial impressions are made. To better understand this phenomenon toward designing a positive unboxing experience in the context of social robots for children, we conducted three field studies with families of children aged 8 to 13: (1) an exploratory free-play activity (n = 12); (2) a co-design session (n = 11) that informed the development of a prototype box and a curated unboxing experience; and (3) a user study (n = 9) that evaluated children’s experiences. Our findings suggest the unboxing experience of social robots can be improved through the design of a creative aesthetic experience that engages the child socially to guide initial interactions and foster a positive child-robot relationship.

Designing for Families as Adaptive Systems: Collaborative Emotional Support and Resilience in the Children's Hospital,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519787,3,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10348990,"
When a child is admitted to the hospital with a critical illness, their family must adapt and manage care and stress. HCI and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) technologies have shown the potential for collaborative technologies to support and augment care collaboration between patients and caregivers. However, less is known about the potential for collaborative technologies to augment family caregiving circles experiences, stressors, and adaptation practices, especially during long hospitalization stays. We interviewed 14 parents of children with cancer admitted for extended hospitalizations in this work. We use the Family Adaptive Systems framework from the family therapy fields as a lens to characterize the challenges and practices of families with a hospitalized child. We characterize the four adaptive systems from the theory: Emotion system, Control system, Meaning, and Maintenance system. Then, we focus on the Emotion system, suggesting opportunities for designing future collaborative technology to augment collaborative caregiving and enhance family resilience.

 EmpathiCH aims at bringing together and blend different expertise to develop new research agenda in the context of “Empathy-Centric Design at Scale”. The main research question is to investigate how new technologies can contribute to the elicitation of empathy across and within multiple stakeholders at scale; and how empathy can be used to design solutions to societal problems that are not only effective but also balanced, inclusive, and aware of their effect on society. Through presentations, participatory sessions, and a living experiment—where data about the peoples’ interactions is collected throughout the event—we aim to make this workshop the ideal venue to foster collaboration, build networks, and shape the future direction of “Empathy-Centric Design at Scale”.

Smartphone overuse is related to a variety of issues such as lack of sleep and anxiety. We explore the application of Self-Affirmation Theory on smartphone overuse intervention in a just-in-time manner. We present TypeOut, a just-in-time intervention technique that integrates two components: an in-situ typing-based unlock process to improve user engagement, and self-affirmation-based typing content to enhance effectiveness. We hypothesize that the integration of typing and self-affirmation content can better reduce smartphone overuse. We conducted a 10-week within-subject field experiment (N=54) and compared TypeOut against two baselines: one only showing the self-affirmation content (a common notification-based intervention), and one only requiring typing non-semantic content (a state-of-the-art method). TypeOut reduces app usage by over 50%, and both app opening frequency and usage duration by over 25%, all significantly outperforming baselines. TypeOut can potentially be used in other domains where an intervention may benefit from integrating self-affirmation exercises with an engaging just-in-time mechanism.

The Feet in Human-Centred Security: Investigating Foot-Based User Authentication for Public Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519838,3,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/267337/1/267337.pdf,"
A large body of work investigated touch, mid-air, and gaze-based user authentication. However, little is known about authentication using other human body parts. In this paper, we investigate the idea of foot-based user authentication for public displays (e.g., ticket machines). We conducted a user study (N=13) on a virtual prototype, FeetAuth, on which participants use their dominant foot to rotate through PIN elements (0–9) that are augmented along a circular layout using augmented reality (AR) technology. We investigate FeetAuth  in combination with three different layouts: Floor-based, Spatial, and Egocentric, finding that Floor-based FeetAuth resulted in the highest usability with 4-digit PIN entry as fast as M=6.71 (SD=0.67). Participants perceived foot-based authentication as socially acceptable and highlighted its accessibility. Our investigation of foot-based authentication paves the way for further studies on the use of the human body for user authentication.

Recently, mental health applications have gained increasing attention. This is because research shows that users find mental health apps as a good alternative for self-management of mental conditions, especially in the last two years when access to physicians was limited because of the pandemic. Despite the existence of several mobile apps for mental health, most available apps are not supported by empirical and scientific evidence, or they are designed based on experimental rather than real data. This work represents our first step toward designing evidence-based AI-driven mental health applications. In this paper, we show our initial results and discussion of in-the-wild users’ interactions and engagement with a mental health app (called Moodie) for a period of two years. Specifically, we investigate the interactions and engagements of 434 users (who used the app for two years) with the mood tracking feature where the app allows users to enter their moods and the corresponding factors associated with the mood. Chi-square analysis showed a significant correlation between moods and factors (or user's activities). The results also show that Home, Work, Relaxation, and Family-related activities are the most common factors that affect moods either positively or negatively and that these factors have a different impact on moods during different times of the year.

Solving separation-of-concerns problems in collaborative design of human-AI systems through leaky abstractions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517537,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hariharan-Subramonyam/publication/360263109_Solving_Separation-of-Concerns_Problems_in_Collaborative_Design_of_Human-AI_Systems_through_Leaky_Abstractions/links/6272f2e72f9ccf58eb2e544f/Solving-Separation-of-Concerns-Problems-in-Collaborative-Design-of-Human-AI-Systems-through-Leaky-Abstractions.pdf,"
 In conventional software development, user experience (UX) designers and engineers collaborate through separation of concerns (SoC): designers create human interface specifications, and engineers build to those specifications. However, we argue that Human-AI systems thwart SoC because human needs must shape the design of the AI interface, the underlying AI sub-components, and training data. How do designers and engineers currently collaborate on AI and UX design? To find out, we interviewed 21 industry professionals (UX researchers, AI engineers, data scientists, and managers) across 14 organizations about their collaborative work practices and associated challenges. We find that hidden information encapsulated by SoC challenges collaboration across design and engineering concerns. Practitioners describe inventing ad-hoc representations exposing low-level design and implementation details (which we characterize as leaky abstractions) to “puncture” SoC and share information across expertise boundaries. We identify how leaky abstractions are employed to collaborate at the AI-UX boundary and formalize a process of creating and using leaky abstractions.

Exploring the Effects of AI-assisted Emotional Support Processes in Online Mental Health Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519854,3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10065,"
 Social support in online mental health communities (OMHCs) is an effective and accessible way of managing mental wellbeing. In this process, sharing emotional supports is considered crucial to the thriving social supports in OMHCs, yet often difficult for both seekers and providers. To support empathetic interactions, we design an AI-infused workflow that allows users to write emotional supporting messages to other users’ posts based on the elicitation of the seeker’s emotion and contextual keywords from writing. Based on a preliminary user study (N = 10), we identified that the system helped seekers to clarify emotion and describe text concretely while writing a post. Providers could also learn how to react empathetically to the post. Based on these results, we suggest design implications for our proposed system.

Inter-brain synchrony and eye gaze direction during collaboration in vr,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519746,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/86446056/3491101.pdf,"
 Brain activity sometimes synchronises when people collaborate together on real world tasks. Understanding this process could to lead to improvements in face to face and remote collaboration. In this paper we report on an experiment exploring the relationship between eye gaze and inter-brain synchrony in Virtual Reality (VR). The experiment recruited pairs who were asked to perform finger-tracking exercises in VR with three different gaze conditions: averted, direct, and natural, while their brain activity was recorded. We found that gaze direction has a significant effect on inter-brain synchrony during collaboration for this task in VR. This shows that representing natural gaze could influence inter-brain synchrony in VR, which may have implications for avatar design for social VR. We discuss implications of our research and possible directions for future work.

Proxemics for human-agent interaction in augmented reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517593,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin-Welsch/publication/360238994_Proxemics_for_Human-Agent_Interaction_in_Augmented_Reality/links/626a9a2005d79a3968a91dca/Proxemics-for-Human-Agent-Interaction-in-Augmented-Reality.pdf,"
Augmented Reality (AR) embeds virtual content in physical spaces, including virtual agents that are known to exert a social presence on users. Existing design guidelines for AR rarely consider the social implications of an agent’s personal space (PS) and that it can impact user behavior and arousal. We report an experiment (N=54) where participants interacted with agents in an AR art gallery scenario. When participants approached six virtual agents (i.e., two males, two females, a humanoid robot, and a pillar) to ask for directions, we found that participants respected the agents’ PS and modulated interpersonal distances according to the human-like agents’ perceived gender. When participants were instructed to walk through the agents, we observed heightened skin-conductance levels that indicate physiological arousal. These results are discussed in terms of proxemic theory that result in design recommendations for implementing pervasive AR experiences with virtual agents.

Impact and user perception of sandwich attacks in the defi ecosystem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517585,14,https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/24769/sandwich_chi%20(4).pdf?sequence=1,"
Decentralized finance (DeFi) enables crypto-asset holders to conduct complex financial transactions, while maintaining control over their assets in the blockchain ecosystem. However, the transparency of blockchain networks and the open mechanism of DeFi applications also cause new security issues. In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.

Haptic devices have been around for decades, providing critical information, usability benefits and improved experiences across tasks from surgical operations to playful applications in Mixed Reality. We see more and more software and hardware solutions emerging that provide design tools, design approaches and platforms, both in academia and industry. However, we believe that designers often re-invent the wheel, and must spend an inordinate amount of time doing their work, which is not sustainable for long-term research. This workshop aims at gathering people from academia and industry to provide a common ground to discuss various insights on and visions of the field. We aim to bring together the various strands of haptics—devices, software, and design—to assess the current state-of-the-art and propose an agenda towards haptics as a united design discipline. We expect the outcome of the workshop to be a comprehensive overview of existing tools and approaches, along with recommendations on how to move the field forward, together.

Enhancing students' social and emotional learning in educational virtual heritage through projective augmented reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503551,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marie-Monique-Schaper/publication/360282955_Enhancing_Students'_Social_and_Emotional_Learning_in_Educational_Virtual_Heritage_through_Projective_Augmented_Reality/links/6375f6132f4bca7fd068dfcc/Enhancing-Students-Social-and-Emotional-Learning-in-Educational-Virtual-Heritage-through-Projective-Augmented-Reality.pdf,"
 The global agenda in education foresees the integration of social and emotional learning to equip students to succeed in our evolving digital society. In this paper, we focus on deepening into the research on AR/MR technologies to foster students’ comprehension of socio-cultural values in historical contexts. We address this challenge by exploring the potential of the interaction paradigm called World-as-Support (WaS). We present a case study of an educational Virtual Heritage experience with primary students for a bomb shelter built during the Spanish Civil War. Our findings showed that the experience enhanced students’ capabilities to reflect upon high-level issues related to value human dignity, to grasp some of the essential qualities of the value solidarity and to connect historical events with present political situations in Spain. Finally, we discuss four design recommendations for learning activities based on the WaS concerning (1) the enhancement of students’ competences in collaboration, and communication; (2) critical thinking; (3) contextualization of historical contents; and (4) moral and ethical considerations for digital augmentation.

Shapeshifter: Gesture Typing in Virtual Reality with a Force-based Digital Thimble,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519679,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519679,"
 Existing text entry techniques for virtual reality are either slow and error-prone, stationary, break immersion, or physically demanding. We present Shapeshifter, a technique that enables text entry in virtual reality by performing gestures and fluctuating contact force on any opaque diffusely reflective surface, including the human body. For this, we developed a digital thimble that users wear in their index finger. The thimble uses an optical sensor to track the finger and a pressure sensor to detect touch and contact force. In a week-long in-the-wild pilot study, Shapeshifter yielded on average 11 wpm on flat surfaces (e.g., a desk) and 9 wpm on the lap when sitting down, and 8 wpm on the palm and back of the hand when standing up in text composition tasks. A simulation study predicted a 27.3 wpm error-free text entry rate for novice users in transcription typing tasks on a desk.

Opportunistic Interfaces for Augmented Reality: Transforming Everyday Objects Into Tangible 6DoF Interfaces Using Ad Hoc UI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519911,5,https://research.google/pubs/pub51310.pdf,"
 Real-time environmental tracking has become a fundamental capability in modern mobile phones and AR/VR devices. However, it only allows user interfaces to be anchored at a static location. Although fiducial and natural-feature tracking overlays interfaces with specific visual features, they typically require developers to define the pattern before deployment. In this paper, we introduce opportunistic interfaces to grant users complete freedom to summon virtual interfaces on everyday objects via voice commands or tapping gestures. We present the workflow and technical details of Ad hoc UI (AhUI), a prototyping toolkit to empower users to turn everyday objects into opportunistic interfaces on the fly. We showcase a set of demos with real-time tracking, voice activation, 6DoF interactions, and mid-air gestures and prospect the future of opportunistic interfaces.

Logic bonbon: exploring food as computational artifact,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501926,16,https://exertiongameslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/logic_bonbon_chi2022.pdf,"
In recognition of food's significant experiential pleasures, culinary practitioners and designers are increasingly exploring novel combinations of computing technologies and food. However, despite much creative endeavors, proposals and prototypes have so far largely maintained a traditional divide, treating food and technology as separate entities. In contrast, we present a “Research through Design” exploration of the notion of food as computational artifact: wherein food itself is the material of computation. We describe the Logic Bonbon, a dessert that can hydrodynamically regulate its flavor via a fluidic logic system. Through a study of experiencing the Logic Bonbon and reflection on our design practice, we offer a provisional account of how food as computational artifact can mediate new interactions through a novel approach to food-computation integration, that promotes an enriched future of Human-Food Interaction.

 Within the general development of games becoming more pervasive and daily life turning more gameful, various location- and movement-based games have become prominent in contemporary culture, and are increasingly used in augmenting the physical reality. This study investigates tensions that arise in augmenting the mundane experience of walking in both urban and nature environments with location-based games (LBGs). We conducted an 8-week autoethnographic study of a newly launched LBG, Pikmin Bloom, a game that can be characterised as gamified walking. We focused on the central design tension of “augmenting walking vs. avoiding disturbing players’ everyday life.” Connected to this, we discuss four other tensions: (1) promise of future vs. enjoyable present; (2) too abundant vs. too scarce rewards; (3) seeking symbiosis vs. manipulating the environment; and (4) player privacy vs. immersive gameplay. This work-in-progress suggests that failing to optimally balance these tensions can have detrimental effects on the playing experience.

Coordination and Collaboration: How do Volunteer Moderators Work as a Team in Live Streaming Communities?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517628,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517628,"
 Volunteer moderators (mods) play significant roles in developing moderation standards and dealing with harmful content in their micro-communities. However, little work explores how volunteer mods work as a team. In line with prior work about understanding volunteer moderation, we interview 40 volunteer mods on Twitch — a leading live streaming platform. We identify how mods collaborate on tasks (off-streaming coordination and preparation, in-stream real-time collaboration, and relationship building both off-stream and in-stream to reinforce collaboration) and how mods contribute to moderation standards (collaboratively working on the community rulebook and individually shaping community norms). We uncover how volunteer mods work as an effective team. We also discuss how the affordances of multi-modal communication and informality of volunteer moderation contribute to task collaboration, standards development, and mod’s roles and responsibilities.

 AI systems are becoming increasingly pervasive within children’s devices, apps, and services. However, it is not yet well-understood how risks and ethical considerations of AI relate to children. This paper makes three contributions to this area: first, it identifies ten areas of alignment between general AI frameworks and codes for age-appropriate design for children. Then, to understand how such principles relate to real application contexts, we conducted a landscape analysis of children’s AI systems, via a systematic literature review including 188 papers. This analysis revealed a wide assortment of applications, and that most systems’ designs addressed only a small subset of principles among those we identified. Finally, we synthesised our findings in a framework to inform a new “Code for Age-Appropriate AI”, which aims to provide timely input to emerging policies and standards, and inspire increased interactions between the AI and child-computer interaction communities.

Expanding Touch Interaction Capabilities for Smart-rings: An Exploration of Continual Slide and Microroll Gestures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519714,4,https://scholar.archive.org/work/udxdkktyqrawvkgg3jyqes6n4u/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519714,"
 As smart-rings emerge in both research and commercial markets, their limited physical size remains to restrict the interaction potential and input vocabulary possible. Thus, focusing on touch interaction for its natural and preferred input potential, this early work explores the combination of slide and microroll gestures performed by the thumb in continual motion on a smart-ring’s touch capacitive surface. We first capture over 3000 slide and microroll gesture instances, extract features, and generate and test machine learning models that are able to discern the slide and microroll gestures within the same touch instance. Through the use of 18 features, our Random Forest model provides a 92.4% accuracy. We conclude with demonstrations of potential applications utilizing continual slide and microroll gestures, and a short discussion which provides future research directions stemming from the positive results obtained from this preliminary work.

Infosonics: Accessible infographics for people who are blind using sonification and voice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517465,11,http://muttler.net/research/papers/CHI2022Infosonics.pdf,"
 Data visualisations are increasingly used online to engage readers and enable independent analysis of the data underlying news stories. However, access to such infographics is problematic for readers who are blind or have low vision (BLV). Equitable access to information is a basic human right and essential for independence and inclusion. We introduce infosonics, the audio equivalent of infographics, as a new style of interactive sonification that uses a spoken introduction and annotation, non-speech audio and sound design elements to present data in an understandable and engaging way. A controlled user evaluation with 18 BLV adults found a COVID-19 infosonic enabled a clearer mental image than a traditional sonification. Further, infosonics prove complementary to text descriptions and facilitate independent understanding of the data. Based on our findings, we provide preliminary suggestions for infosonics design, which we hope will enable BLV people to gain equitable access to online news and information.

Capable but amoral? Comparing AI and human expert collaboration in ethical decision making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517732,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517732,"
 While artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied for decision-making processes, ethical decisions pose challenges for AI applications. Given that humans cannot always agree on the right thing to do, how would ethical decision-making by AI systems be perceived and how would responsibility be ascribed in human-AI collaboration? In this study, we investigate how the expert type (human vs. AI) and level of expert autonomy (adviser vs. decider) influence trust, perceived responsibility, and reliance. We find that participants consider humans to be more morally trustworthy but less capable than their AI equivalent. This shows in participants’ reliance on AI: AI recommendations and decisions are accepted more often than the human expert’s. However, AI team experts are perceived to be less responsible than humans, while programmers and sellers of AI systems are deemed partially responsible instead.

 With the wide usage of data visualizations, a huge number of Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)-based visualizations have been created and shared online. Accordingly, there has been an increasing interest in exploring how to retrieve perceptually similar visualizations from a large corpus, since it can benefit various downstream applications such as visualization recommendation. Existing methods mainly focus on the visual appearance of visualizations by regarding them as bitmap images. However, the structural information intrinsically existing in SVG-based visualizations is ignored. Such structural information can delineate the spatial and hierarchical relationship among visual elements, and characterize visualizations thoroughly from a new perspective. This paper presents a structure-aware method to advance the performance of visualization retrieval by collectively considering both the visual and structural information. We extensively evaluated our approach through quantitative comparisons, a user study and case studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over existing methods.

The Village: Infrastructuring Community-based Mentoring to Support Adults Experiencing Poverty,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501949,14,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501949,"
 Mentorship and other social and relational support have been vital to poverty alleviation and transformative change. It is crucial to understand the underlying factors in the success of mentoring models and subsequent programs to support them. Thus, we conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of longitudinal surveys of community participants followed by semi-structured interviews with 28 community members, eight mentors, and two coaches participating in a community-based mentorship program. Drawing from community-based participatory research in partnership with a non-profit located in a Midwestern United States (U.S.) city, we unpack how the program supported self-sufficiency and economic mobility among adults experiencing financial hardships. Through an infrastructural lens, we attend to individuals’ infrastructuring work in social support, flexibility, and trust to support a “village” model of community-based mentorship. Our results show how the village model differs from traditional mentorship models that assume dyadic, one-to-one, often didactic, and hierarchical relationships (e.g., expert and protégé, adult and child) and are used primarily in the workplace and educational settings. The village mentorship model advocates for less hierarchical and more balanced relationships in non-institutional settings and flexible communication and technological needs. We discuss new research opportunities and design strategies for rethinking technology-mediated mentorship to support poverty-stricken adults in the U.S.

AI generated characters, i.e., realistic renderings of human faces, voices, and mannerisms that appear authentic to a human being [7] are made possible through advancements in generative machine learning. In addition to character creation, neural networks have recently also been used for the hyper-realistic synthesis and modification of prose, images, audio, and video data.  While this technology has been most widely associated with media manipulation and the spread of misinformation, often referred to as deepfakes, it is increasingly being used for positive applications and integrated into areas ranging from entertainment, to humanitarian efforts and education. With the adaptation and usage of AI generated characters across different industries, we see a potential for significant positive applications in a variety of fields such as learning, privacy, telecommunication, art, and therapy. In this workshop, we will bring together researchers in HCI, AI, and related fields to explore the positive applications, design considerations, and ethical implications of using AI generated characters and related forms of synthetic media.

Saliency methods — techniques to identify the importance of input features on a model’s output — are a common step in understanding neural network behavior. However, interpreting saliency requires tedious manual inspection to identify and aggregate patterns in model behavior, resulting in ad hoc or cherry-picked analysis. To address these concerns, we present Shared Interest: metrics for comparing model reasoning (via saliency) to human reasoning (via ground truth annotations). By providing quantitative descriptors, Shared Interest enables ranking, sorting, and aggregating inputs, thereby facilitating large-scale systematic analysis of model behavior. We use Shared Interest to identify eight recurring patterns in model behavior, such as cases where contextual features or a subset of ground truth features are most important to the model. Working with representative real-world users, we show how Shared Interest can be used to decide if a model is trustworthy, uncover issues missed in manual analyses, and enable interactive probing.

 The goal of this paper is to understand how people assess human-likeness in human- and AI-generated behavior. To this end, we present a qualitative study of hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments of human-likeness of behavior in a 3D video game navigation task. In particular, we focus on an AI agent that has passed a Turing Test, in the sense that human judges were not able to reliably distinguish between videos of a human and AI agent navigating on a quantitative level. Our insights shine a light on the characteristics that people consider as human-like. Understanding these characteristics is a key first step for improving AI agents in the future.

Head-mounted augmented reality (AR) displays allow for the seamless integration of virtual visualisation with contextual tangible references, such as physical (tangible) globes. We explore the design of immersive geospatial data visualisation with AR and tangible globes. We investigate the “tangible-virtual interplay” of tangible globes with virtual data visualisation, and propose a conceptual approach for designing immersive geospatial globes. We demonstrate a set of use cases, such as augmenting a tangible globe with virtual overlays, using a physical globe as a tangible input device for interacting with virtual globes and maps, and linking an augmented globe to an abstract data visualisation. We gathered qualitative feedback from experts about our use case visualisations, and compiled a summary of key takeaways as well as ideas for envisioned future improvements. The proposed design space, example visualisations and lessons learned aim to guide the design of tangible globes for data visualisation in AR.

 With the rapid development of creativity support tools, creative practitioners (e.g., designers, artists, architects) have to constantly explore and adopt new tools into their practice. While HCI research has focused on developing novel creativity support tools, little is known about creative practitioner’s values when exploring and adopting these tools. We collect and analyze 23 videos, 13 interviews, and 105 survey responses of creative practitioners reflecting on their values to derive a value framework. We find that practitioners value the tools’ functionality, integration into their current workflow, performance, user interface and experience, learning support, costs and emotional connection, in that order. They largely discover tools through personal recommendations. To help unify and encourage reflection from the wider community of CST stakeholders (e.g., systems creators, researchers, marketers, educators), we situate the framework within existing research on systems, creativity support tools and technology adoption.

 The concept of social justice in Human-Computer Interaction has become an emergent domain of practice and research across the past decade. Work has included research efforts into meeting the needs of under-served populations, providing method blueprints for inclusion of marginalised identities, and a call for greater consideration on how positive impact is defined both in and beyond research engagements. While the number of justice-orientated works may have increased, new social forces question what is meant by the term justice in social justice initiatives; asking who is included in how justice is defined, what its goals are and how might we measure it. We offer this workshop as an opportunity to: (a) build conceptual and visual ‘mosaics’ of social justice works in HCI to map out the existing landscape; (b) build a supportive community of HCI researchers, practitioners, activists and designers who work with matters of in/justice to share vocabulary, approaches and expertise with likewise individuals; (c) facilitate critical conversations around meaningful justice-orientated action and practice, and how they might relate to wider justice frameworks.

 Connecting digital information with the physical is one of the essential ideas of tangible user interfaces. The design of the physical representation is important especially for specialised domains like surgery planning, because surgeons rely heavily on their tactile senses. Therefore, this research work investigates the effect of a soft and a hard 3D model as an interaction device for virtual reality surgical planning. A user study with 13 surgeons reveals a clear preference for the softer, more realistic material and a significantly higher haptic user experience for the soft model compared to the hard one. These results advocate for stressing material aspects along with the interaction design in domains with an inherently high focus on tactile aspects.

Onelabeler: A flexible system for building data labeling tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517612,11,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14227,"
 Labeled datasets are essential for supervised machine learning. Various data labeling tools have been built to collect labels in different usage scenarios. However, developing labeling tools is time-consuming, costly, and expertise-demanding on software development. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for data labeling and OneLabeler based on the conceptual framework to support easy building of labeling tools for diverse usage scenarios. The framework consists of common modules and states in labeling tools summarized through coding of existing tools. OneLabeler supports configuration and composition of common software modules through visual programming to build data labeling tools. A module can be a human, machine, or mixed computation procedure in data labeling. We demonstrate the expressiveness and utility of the system through ten example labeling tools built with OneLabeler.

Community dynamics in technospiritual interventions: lessons learned from a church-based mHealth pilot,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517700,12,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10376103,"
 HCI researchers have increasingly examined how social context shapes health behaviors. Much of this work operates at the interpersonal level. Communities such as churches play important roles in supporting wellbeing and addressing health inequities. While some work has investigated creating digital health tools for religious populations, few have explicitly focused on the incorporation of community support in the form of prayer support. Embedding health interventions in any community has the potential to support or challenge the community’s dynamics. We report on findings from interviews with 17 church members who used a church-based mHealth application over a 4-week period and provide guidelines for developers based on these results. Through their use of the system, participants characterized several community dynamics including a desire for social intimacy, communicating care, creating opportunities for fellowship, maintaining privacy and discretion, and building community connections, and how these dynamics influence their aspirations for a church-based health app.

Prevalence and salience of problematic microtransactions in top-grossing mobile and PC games: a content analysis of user reviews,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502056,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502056,"
 Microtransactions have become a major monetisation model in digital games, shaping their design, impacting player experience, and raising ethical concerns. Research in this area has chiefly focused on loot boxes. This begs the question whether other microtransactions might actually be more relevant and problematic for players. We therefore conducted a content analysis of negative player reviews (n=801) of top-grossing mobile and desktop games to determine which problematic microtransactions are most prevalent and salient for players. We found that problematic microtransactions with mobile games featuring more frequent and different techniques compared to desktop games. Across both, players minded issues related to fairness, transparency, and degraded user experience, supporting prior theoretical work, and importantly take issue with monetisation-driven design as such. We identify future research needs on why microtransactions in particular spark this critique, and which player communities it may be more or less representative of.

“Reality Anchors”: Bringing Cues from Reality into VR on Public Transport to Alleviate Safety and Comfort Concerns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519696,3,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/271016/1/271016.pdf,"
Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have the unique capability to create private virtual content anywhere around the user, going beyond the capacities of traditional devices, but are not widely used while travelling, due to safety and comfort concerns. Showing objects from reality - ""Reality Anchors"" - could help reduce these concerns. We present a user study (N=20) that investigates how the use of real-world cues and different VR environments affect users’ feelings of safety, social acceptability, awareness, presence, escapism and immersion, which are key barriers to VR adoption. Our findings show that knowing where other people are on the bus could significantly reduce concerns associated with VR use in transit, resulting in increased feelings of safety, social acceptability and awareness, but with the concession that the user's immersion may be reduced. The VR environment also affected the level of immersion and the feelings of escapism, with a 360-video environment returning higher scores than a 2D one.

Yo–Yo Machines: Self-Build Devices that Support Social Connections During the Pandemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517547,14,https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/49272/1/Yo_Yo_Machines_AAM_.pdf,"
Yo–Yo Machines are playful communication devices designed to help people feel socially connected while physically separated. We designed them to reach as many people as possible, both to make a positive impact during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess a self-build approach to circulating research products and the appeal of peripheral and expressive communication devices. A portfolio of four distinct designs, based on over 30 years of research, were made available for people to make by following simple online instructions (yoyomachines.io). Each involves connecting a pair of identical devices over the internet to allow simple communication at a distance. This paper describes our motivation for the project, previous work in the area, the design of the devices, supporting website and publicity, and how users have made and used Yo-Yo Machines. Finally, we reflect on what we learned about peripheral and expressive communication devices and implications for the self-build approach.

In-depth mouse: Integrating desktop mouse into virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501884,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501884,"
 Virtual Reality (VR) has potential for productive knowledge work, however, midair pointing with controllers or hand gestures does not offer the precision and comfort of traditional 2D mice. Directly integrating mice into VR is difficult as selecting targets in a 3D space is negatively impacted by binocular rivalry, perspective mismatch, and improperly calibrated control-display (CD) gain. To address these issues, we developed Depth-Adaptive Cursor , a 2D-mouse driven pointing technique for 3D selection with depth-adaptation that continuously interpolates the cursor depth by inferring what users intend to select based on the cursor position, the viewpoint, and the selectable objects. Depth-Adaptive Cursor uses a novel CD gain tool to compute a usable range of CD gains for general mouse-based pointing in VR. A user study demonstrated that Depth-Adaptive Cursor significantly improved performance compared with an existing mouse-based pointing technique without depth-adaption in terms of time (21.2%), error (48.3%), perceived workload, and user satisfaction.

Controllerpose: inside-out body capture with VR controller cameras,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502105,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3502105,"
 We present a new and practical method for capturing user body pose in virtual reality experiences: integrating cameras into handheld controllers, where batteries, computation and wireless communication already exist. By virtue of the hands operating in front of the user during many VR interactions, our controller-borne cameras can capture a superior view of the body for digitization. Our pipeline composites multiple camera views together, performs 3D body pose estimation, uses this data to control a rigged human model with inverse kinematics, and exposes the resulting user avatar to end user applications. We developed a series of demo applications illustrating the potential of our approach and more leg-centric interactions, such as balancing games and kicking soccer balls. We describe our proof-of-concept hardware and software, as well as results from our user study, which point to imminent feasibility.

From who you know to what you read: augmenting scientific recommendations with implicit social networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517470,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517470,"
The ever-increasing pace of scientific publication necessitates methods for quickly identifying relevant papers. While neural recommenders trained on user interests can help, they still result in long, monotonous lists of suggested papers. To improve the discovery experience we introduce multiple new methods for augmenting recommendations with textual relevance messages that highlight knowledge-graph connections between recommended papers and a user’s publication and interaction history. We explore associations mediated by author entities and those using citations alone. In a large-scale, real-world study, we show how our approach significantly increases engagement—and future engagement when mediated by authors—without introducing bias towards highly-cited authors. To expand message coverage for users with less publication or interaction history, we develop a novel method that highlights connections with proxy authors of interest to users and evaluate it in a controlled lab study. Finally, we synthesize design implications for future graph-based messages.

The TAC toolkit: supporting design for user acceptance of health technologies from a macro-temporal perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502039,14,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502039,"
 User acceptance is key for the successful uptake and use of health technologies, but also impacted by numerous factors not always easily accessible nor operationalised by designers in practice. This work seeks to facilitate the application of acceptance theory in design practice through the Technology Acceptance (TAC) toolkit: a novel theory-based design tool and method comprising 16 cards, 3 personas, 3 scenarios, a virtual think-space, and a website, which we evaluated through workshops conducted with 21 designers of health technologies. Findings showed that the toolkit revised and extended designers’ knowledge of technology acceptance, fostered their appreciation, empathy and ethical values while designing for acceptance, and contributed towards shaping their future design practice. We discuss implications for considering user acceptance a dynamic, multi-stage process in design practice, and better supporting designers in imagining distant acceptance challenges. Finally, we examine the generative value of the TAC toolkit and its possible future evolution.

Telling stories from computational notebooks: Ai-assisted presentation slides creation for presenting data science work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517615,13,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11085,"
 Creating presentation slides is a critical but time-consuming task for data scientists. While researchers have proposed many AI techniques to lift data scientists’ burden on data preparation and model selection, few have targeted the presentation creation task. Based on the needs identified from a formative study, this paper presents NB2Slides, an AI system that facilitates users to compose presentations of their data science work. NB2Slides uses deep learning methods as well as example-based prompts to generate slides from computational notebooks, and take users’ input (e.g., audience background) to structure the slides. NB2Slides also provides an interactive visualization that links the slides with the notebook to help users further edit the slides. A follow-up user evaluation with 12 data scientists shows that participants believed NB2Slides can improve efficiency and reduces the complexity of creating slides. Yet, participants questioned the future of full automation and suggested a human-AI collaboration paradigm.

Designing for Continuous Interaction with Artificial Intelligence Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516409,3,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10149321/1/chi22extendedabstracts-170.pdf,"
 The increasing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence enable the support of users in a continuously growing number of applications. Current systems typically dictate that interaction between user input and AI output unfolds in discrete steps, as is the case with, for example, conversational agents. Novel scenarios require AI systems to adapt and respond to continuous user input, e.g., image-guided surgery and AI-supported text entry. In and across these applications, AI systems need to support more varied and dynamic interactions in which users and AI interact continuously and in parallel. Current methods and guidelines are often inadequate and sometimes even detrimental to user needs when considering continuous usage scenarios. Realizing a continuous interaction between users and AI requires a substantial change in perspective when designing Human-AI systems. In this SIG, we support the exchange of cutting-edge research contributing to a better understanding and improved methods and tools to design continuous Human-AI interaction.

Iterating through Feeling-with Nonhuman Things: Exploring repertoires for design iteration in more-than-human design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519860,3,https://summit.sfu.ca/_flysystem/fedora/2022-08/input_data/22026/chi22extendedabstracts-444.pdf,"
In this paper, we explore the notion of sympathy in the context of more-than-human design to include nonhuman participation in a design iteration process in an ongoing project named the Morse Things. We explore ways in which nonhuman agency, particularly breakage, can participate in an assembly of human and nonhuman designers. Motivated by Ron Wakkary's theory of designing-with and the concept of repertoires, we propose feeling-with as a potential repertoire for increasing nonhuman participation before, during, and after the design process. Finally, we explore four instances of sympathy and how breakage as a nonhuman force can lead us to new design iterations to redesign the new set of Morse Things.

Hitting the Triple Bottom Line: Widening the HCI Approach to Sustainability,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517518,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517518,"
Sustainable Development (SD) in its dimensions – environment, economy, and society – is a growing area of concern within the HCI community. This paper advances a systematic literature review on sustainability across the Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction (SHCI) body of work. The papers were classified according to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework to understand how the pillars of SD play into the HCI discourse on sustainability. The economic angle was identified as a gap in SHCI literature. To meet the TBL of SD, however, a balance needs to be sought across all ‘lines’. In this paper, we propose that HCI can advance the discussion and the understanding of the economic concepts around sustainability through taking a sociology perspective on the economic angle of the TBL. We sustain this claim by discussing economic concepts and the role that digital can play in redefining the established foundations of our economic system.

Everywhere Cursor: Extending Desktop Mouse Interaction into Spatial Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519796,3,,"
Spatial augmented reality (SAR) allows us to extend desktop environments to our surroundings. However, previous works on enabling mouse interaction in SAR lacks consistent pointing behaviour with desktop environments. We present Everywhere Cursor, an indirect mouse interaction technique that moves along the environment’s surface geometry, which preserves mouse behaviour in desktop environments. We discuss fundamental design problems in extending desktop mouse interaction to SAR, implementation details of our system, and guidelines on future improvements. Our work provides an important step in the transition of desktop environments to a pervasive computing system.

"FluidMeet: Enabling Frictionless Transitions Between In-Group, Between-Group, and Private Conversations During Virtual Breakout Meetings",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517558,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517558,"
 People often form small conversation groups during physical gatherings to have ad-hoc and informal conversations. As these groups are loosely defined, others can often overhear and join the conversation. However, current video-conferencing tools only allow for strict boundaries between small conversation groups, inhibiting fluid group formations and between-group conversations. This isolates small-group conversations from others and leads to inefficient transitions between conversations. We present FluidMeet, a virtual breakout meeting system that employs flexible conversation boundaries and cross-group conversation visualizations to enable fluid conversation group formations and ad-hoc, informal conversations. FluidMeet enables out-group members to overhear group conversations while allowing conversation groups to control their shared level of context. Users within conversation groups can also quickly switch between in-group and private conversations. A study of FluidMeet showed that it encouraged users to break group boundaries, made them feel less isolated in group conversations, and facilitated communication across different groups.

“Just Not Together”: The Experience of Videoconferencing for People with Aphasia during the Covid-19 Pandemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502017,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502017,"
People with language impairments, such as aphasia, use a range of total communication strategies. These go beyond spoken language to include non-verbal utterances, props and gestures. The uptake of videoconferencing platforms necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic means that people with aphasia now use these communication strategies online. However, no data exists on the impact of videoconferencing on communication for this population. Working with an aphasia charity that moved its conversation support sessions online, we investigated the experience of communication via a videoconferencing platform. We report a study which investigated this through: 1) observations of online conversation support sessions; 2) interviews with speech and language therapists and volunteers; and 3) interviews with people with aphasia. Our findings reveal the unique and creative ways that the charity and its members with aphasia adapted their communication to videoconferencing. We unpack specific, novel challenges relating to total communication via videoconferencing and the related impacts on social and privacy issues.

Debiased label aggregation for subjective crowdsourcing tasks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519614,3,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/50486/1/DLA-camready.pdf,"
 Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) allow people to collect and curate labeled data from multiple annotators. Then labels are often aggregated to create an annotated dataset suitable for supervised machine learning tasks. The most popular label aggregation method is majority voting, where each item in the dataset is assigned the most common label from the annotators. This approach is optimal when annotators are unbiased domain experts. In this paper, we propose Debiased Label Aggregation (DLA) an alternative method for label aggregation in subjective HITs, where cross-annotator agreement varies. DLA leverages user voting behavior patterns to weight labels. Our experiments show that DLA outperforms majority voting in several performance metrics; e.g. a percentage increase of 20 points in the F1 measure before data augmentation, and a percentage increase of 35 points in the same measure after data augmentation. Since DLA is deceptively simple, we hope it will help researchers to tackle subjective labeling tasks.

Helping Mobile Learners Know Unknown Words through their Reading Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519620,4,https://imlab.jp/publication_data/1854/CHI2022_HigashimuraRiku_Paper.pdf,"
 Vocabulary acquisition is a fundamental part of learning a new language. In order to acquire new vocabulary, words with meanings that are unknown to the learner must be added to the language learning process. When searching for material in the target language, it is useful to know how much of a document is made up of currently unknown words. One simple way to estimate the unknown words in a document is to use the frequency of occurrence, which indicates the difficulty of the word. However, this approach can lead to missed unknown words. In this study, we aim to improve the accuracy of unknown word estimation by using reading activity data obtained from smartphone sensors and taking into account the individual learner’s English reading behavior. We apply a novel user interface which allows us to improve estimation through reading behavior, without the use of eye-trackers.

Investigating perceptual biases in icon arrays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501874,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501874,"
 Icon arrays are graphical displays in which a subset of identical shapes are filled to convey probabilities. They are widely used for communicating probabilities to the general public. A primary design decision concerning icon arrays is how to fill and arrange these shapes. For example, a designer could fill the shapes from top to bottom or in a random fashion. We investigated the effect of different arrangements in icon arrays on probability perception. We showed participants icon arrays depicting probabilities between 0% and 100% in six different arrangements. Participants were more accurate in estimating probabilities when viewing the top, row, and diagonal arrangements, but they overestimated the proportions with the central arrangement and underestimated the proportions with the edge arrangement. They were biased to either overestimate or underestimate when viewing the random arrangement depending on the objective proportions, following a cyclical pattern consistent with existing findings in the psychophysics literature.

Online data visualizations play an important role in informing public opinion but are often inaccessible to screen reader users. To address the need for accessible data representations on the web that provide direct, multimodal, and up-to-date access to the data, we investigate audio data narratives –which combine textual descriptions and sonification (the mapping of data to non-speech sounds). We conduct two co-design workshops with screen reader users to define design principles that guide the structure, content, and duration of a data narrative. Based on these principles and relevant auditory processing characteristics, we propose a dynamic programming approach to automatically generate an audio data narrative from a given dataset. We evaluate our approach with 16 screen reader users. Findings show with audio narratives, users gain significantly more insights from the data. Users describe data narratives help them better extract and comprehend the information in both the sonification and description.

 Self-reported quality and duration of sleep in Western populations is declining. The interest in wearable sleep-trackers that are promising better sleep is growing. By wearing a device day and night the sleeper is continuously connected to a more-than-human network. The mass-adoption of sleep-tracking devices has an impact on the personal, social and cultural meaning of sleep. This study looks at the discourse forming around wearable sleep-trackers. This extended abstract presents how non-human subjectivities are accounted for in this discourse. Through a posthuman discourse analysis of textual and visual artefacts from interviews, academic research and popular media, six distinct roles for these non-human social agents were identified: ‘Teacher’, ‘Informant’, ‘Companion’, ‘Therapist’, ‘Coach’ and ‘Mediator’. This characterisation is a first step to understanding sleep-trackers as social agents, reorganising personal and contextual relationships with the sleeping self.

A design space for data visualisation transformations between 2d and 3d in mixed-reality environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501859,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501859,"
 As mixed-reality (MR) technologies become more mainstream, the delineation between data visualisations displayed on screens or other surfaces and those floating in space becomes increasingly blurred. Rather than the choice of using either a 2D surface or the 3D space for visualising data being a dichotomy, we argue that users should have the freedom to transform visualisations seamlessly between the two as needed. However, the design space for such transformations is large, and practically uncharted. To explore this, we first establish an overview of the different states that a data visualisation can take in MR, followed by how transformations between these states can facilitate common visualisation tasks. We then describe a design space of how these transformations function, in terms of the different stages throughout the transformation, and the user interactions and input parameters that affect it. This design space is then demonstrated with multiple exemplary techniques based in MR.

Bursting scientific filter bubbles: Boosting innovation via novel author discovery,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501905,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501905,"
 Isolated silos of scientific research and the growing challenge of information overload limit awareness across the literature and hinder innovation. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which often prioritize relevance, can further reinforce these informational “filter bubbles.” In response, we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their work. We construct a faceted representation of authors with information gleaned from their papers and inferred author personas, and use it to develop an approach that locates commonalities and contrasts between scientists to balance relevance and novelty. In studies with computer science researchers, this approach helps users discover authors considered useful for generating novel research directions. We also demonstrate an approach for displaying information about authors, boosting the ability to understand the work of new, unfamiliar scholars. Our analysis reveals that Bridger connects authors who have different citation profiles and publish in different venues, raising the prospect of bridging diverse scientific communities.

During crises like COVID-19, individuals are inundated with conflicting and time-sensitive information that drives a need for rapid assessment of the trustworthiness and reliability of information sources and platforms. This parallels evolutions in information infrastructures, ranging from social media to government data platforms. Distinct from current literature, which presumes a static relationship between the presence or absence of trust and people’s behaviors, our mixed-methods research focuses on situated trust, or trust that is shaped by people’s information-seeking and assessment practices through emerging information platforms (e.g., social media, crowdsourced systems, COVID data platforms). Our findings characterize the shifts in trustee (what/who people trust) from information on social media to the social media platform(s), how distrust manifests skepticism in issues of data discrepancy, the insufficient presentation of uncertainty, and how this trust and distrust shift over time. We highlight the deep challenges in existing information infrastructures that influence trust and distrust formation.

Augmented Reality Smart Glasses (ARSG) are a recent development in consumer-level personal computing technology. Research on ARSGs has largely focused on new forms of etiquette for these personal computing devices, but little else has been examined due in part to consumer availability. The most well-known example of ARSGs is Google Glass, which are no longer available for consumer purchase due to privacy concerns. Google has more recently transitioned to industry-focused applications with the Glass Enterprise Edition [1]. Recent consumer-facing iterations on the technology include Snapchat Spectacles and Ray-Ban Stories, which reignite some of the anxieties surrounding wearable cameras. Focals by North, the ARSG product studied in this project, do not have the capacity to record video or audio, thus mitigating the risk of privacy breaches. This study examines how users of Focals employ the device, successfully or not, to facilitate daily activities such as scheduling, communication, wayfinding, and how non-users perceive the interactions of Focals users. Participants wrote blog responses and participated in a focus group on their daily experiences with the glasses; they also speculated on potential uses and features of future iterations relating to accessibility and entertainment purposes. Focals by North, a relatively low-cost ARSG, aims to make this tech mass market to “seamlessly [blend] technology into our world” [2]. However, this study found participants preferred choice when receiving notifications, and greatly questioned the need for notifications to appear in their field of vision. We anticipate that these results will inform frameworks for assessing consumer facing ARSG products in future work.

 Being confronted with a dulling perception and challenges to be creative when working at home, I imagined my home office to sense my state of arousal and search together with me for inspirational moments by infusing its familiar appearance with distortion.  In two prototypical human-home office interaction systems, we use Virtual Reality (VR), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to enhance a home office’s sensibility towards its user’s level of arousal as well as to enlarge its textural action space.  Although physiological feedback in machine learning faces low learning rates, the resulting interaction offers a fresh perspective on our human-home office relation.

Towards decomposable interactive systems: Design of a backyard-degradable wireless heating interface,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502007,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502007,"
Sustainability is critical to our planet and thus our designs. Within HCI, there is a tension between the desire to create interactive electronic systems and sustainability. In this paper, we present the design of an interactive system comprising components that are entirely decomposable. We leverage the inherent material properties of natural materials, such as paper, leaf skeletons, and chitosan, along with silver nanowires to create a new system capable of being electrically controlled as a portable heater. This new decomposable system, capable of wirelessly heating to >70°C, is flexible, lightweight, low-cost, and reusable, and it maintains its functionality over long periods of heating and multiple power cycles. We detail its design and present a series of use cases, from enabling a novel resealable packaging system to acting as a catalyst for shape-changing designs and beyond. Finally, we highlight the important decomposable property of the interactive system when it meets end-of-life.

Machine In The Middle: Exploring Dark Patterns of Emotional Human-Computer Integration Through Media Art,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503555,3,https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/preview/10012050/3491101.3503555.pdf,"
 As our relationship with machines becomes evermore intimate, we observe increasing efforts in the quantification of human emotion, which has historically generated unintended consequences. We acknowledge an amplification of this trend through recent technological developments that aim toward human-computer integration, and explore the dark patterns that may arise for integrating emotions with machinic processes through “machine_in_the_middle”. Machine_in_the_middle is an interactive system in which a participant wears an electroencephalographic headset, and their neural activity is analysed to ascertain an approximation of their emotional state. Using electrical muscle stimulation their face is animated into an expression that corresponds with the output of the emotional recognition system. Through our work, we contribute the insight of three possible dark patterns that might emerge from emotional integration, including: reductionism of human emotion, disruptions of agency, and parasitic symbiosis. We hope that these insights inspire researchers and practitioners to approach human-computer integration more cautiously.

Barriers to expertise in citizen science games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517541,10,http://joshaaronmiller.com/papers/CHI22-barriers.pdf,"
 Expertise-centric citizen science games (ECCSGs) can be powerful tools for crowdsourcing scientific knowledge production. However, to be effective these games must train their players on how to become experts, which is difficult in practice. In this study, we investigated the path to expertise and the barriers involved by interviewing players of three ECCSGs: Foldit, Eterna, and Eyewire. We then applied reflexive thematic analysis to generate themes of their experiences and produce a model of expertise and its barriers. We found expertise is constructed through a cycle of exploratory and social learning but prevented by instructional design issues. Moreover, exploration is slowed by a lack of polish to the game artifact, and social learning is disrupted by a lack of clear communication. Based on our analysis we make several recommendations for CSG developers, including: collaborating with professionals of required skill sets; providing social features and feedback systems; and improving scientific communication.

Emoballoon-conveying emotional arousal in text chats with speech balloons,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501920,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501920,"
Text chat applications are an integral part of daily social and professional communication. However, messages sent over text chat applications do not convey vocal or nonverbal information from the sender, and detecting the emotional tone in text-only messages is challenging. In this paper, we explore the effects of speech balloon shapes on the sender-receiver agreement regarding the emotionality of a text message. We first investigated the relationship between the shape of a speech balloon and the emotionality of speech text in Japanese manga. Based on these results, we created a system that automatically generates speech balloons matching linear emotional arousal intensity by Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN). Our evaluation results from a controlled experiment suggested that the use of emotional speech balloons outperforms the use of emoticons in decreasing the differences between message senders’ and receivers’ perceptions about the level of emotional arousal in text messages.

"Engaging with Automation: Understanding and Designing for Operation, Appropriation, and Behaviour Change",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503735,3,https://hal.science/hal-03855009/document,"
 Automation has been permeating our everyday lives in various facets. Given both the ubiquity and, in many cases, the indispensability of ubiquitous automated systems, creating engaging experiences with them becomes increasingly relevant. This workshop provides a platform for researchers and practitioners working on (semi-)automated systems and their user experience and allows for cross-discipline networking and knowledge transfer. In a keynote talk, paper presentations, discussions, and hands-on sessions, the participants will explore and discuss user engagement with automation for operation, appropriation, and change. The results of the workshop are a set of research ideas and drafts of joint research projects to drive further automation experience research in a collaborative interdisciplinary manner.

Will AI console me when I lose my pet? Understanding perceptions of AI-mediated email writing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517731,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517731,"
 Large language models are increasingly mediating, modifying, and even generating messages for users, but the receivers of these messages may not be aware of the involvement of AI. To examine this emerging direction of AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC), we investigate people’s perceptions of AI written messages. We analyze how such perceptions change in accordance with the interpersonal emphasis of a given message. We conducted both large-scale surveys and in-depth interviews to investigate how a diverse set of factors influence people’s perceived trust in AI-mediated writing of emails. We found that people’s trust in email writers decreased when they were told that AI was involved in the writing process. Surprisingly trust increased when AI was used for writing more interpersonal emails (as opposed to more transactional ones). Our study provides insights regarding how people perceive AI-MC and has practical design implications on building AI-based products to aid human interlocutors in communication1.

Understanding and Designing Avatar Biosignal Visualizations for Social Virtual Reality Entertainment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517451,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517451,"
Visualizing biosignals can be important for social Virtual Reality (VR), where avatar non-verbal cues are missing. While several biosignal representations exist, designing effective visualizations and understanding user perceptions within social VR entertainment remains unclear. We adopt a mixed-methods approach to design biosignals for social VR entertainment. Using survey (N=54), context-mapping (N=6), and co-design (N=6) methods, we derive four visualizations. We then ran a within-subjects study (N=32) in a virtual jazz-bar to investigate how heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) visualizations, and signal rate, influence perceived avatar arousal, user distraction, and preferences. Findings show that skeuomorphic visualizations for both biosignals allow differentiable arousal inference; skeuomorphic and particles were least distracting for HR, whereas all were similarly distracting for BR; biosignal perceptions often depend on avatar relations, entertainment type, and emotion inference of avatars versus spaces. We contribute HR and BR visualizations, and considerations for designing social VR entertainment biosignal visualizations.

Audio matters too: How audial avatar customization enhances visual avatar customization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501848,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501848,"
Avatar customization is known to positively affect crucial outcomes in numerous domains. However, it is unknown whether audial customization can confer the same benefits as visual customization. We conducted a preregistered 2 x 2 (visual choice vs. visual assignment x audial choice vs. audial assignment) study in a Java programming game. Participants with visual choice experienced higher avatar identification and autonomy. Participants with audial choice experienced higher avatar identification and autonomy, but only within the group of participants who had visual choice available. Visual choice led to an increase in time spent, and indirectly led to increases in intrinsic motivation, immersion, time spent, future play motivation, and likelihood of game recommendation. Audial choice moderated the majority of these effects. Our results suggest that audial customization plays an important enhancing role vis-à-vis visual customization. However, audial customization appears to have a weaker effect compared to visual customization. We discuss the implications for avatar customization more generally across digital applications.

It is assumed that to appreciate a knowledge contribution in research-through-design, we all agree on what the act of designing is and should deliver in research. However, just from a glance at contributions in an HCI context, this is far from the case. The course is based on the book: Drifting by intention – four epistemic traditions in constructive design research authored by the instructors. It unpacks different ways of knowing in practice-based design and provides operational models and hands-on exercises applied on participants cases to help plan and articulate the contribution of design in each participant's individual research project.

Driving from a distance: challenges and guidelines for autonomous vehicle teleoperation interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501827,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joel-Lanir/publication/360263621_Driving_from_a_Distance_Challenges_and_Guidelines_for_Autonomous_Vehicle_Teleoperation_Interfaces/links/626fdbfcb1ad9f66c89b179c/Driving-from-a-Distance-Challenges-and-Guidelines-for-Autonomous-Vehicle-Teleoperation-Interfaces.pdf,"
Autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies are rapidly evolving with the vision of having self-driving cars moving safely with no human input. However, it is clear that at least in the near and foreseeable future, AVs will not be able to resolve all road incidents and that in some situations remote human assistance will be required. However, remote driving is not trivial and introduces many challenges stemming mostly from the physical disconnect of the remote operator. In order to highlight these challenges and understand how to better design AV teleoperation interfaces, we conducted several observations of AV teleoperation sessions as well as in-depth interviews with 14 experts. Based on these interviews, we provide an investigation and analysis of the major AV teleoperation challenges. We follow this by providing design suggestions for the development of future teleoperation interfaces for assistance and driving of AVs.

Mood worlds: A virtual environment for autonomous emotional expression,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501861,11,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10150739/1/Wagener-2022_Mood-Worlds_CHI.pdf,"
 Immersive interactive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) have the potential to foster well-being. While VR applications have been successfully used to evoke positive emotions through the presetting of light, colour and scenery, the experiential potential of allowing users to independently create a virtual environment (VE) has not yet been sufficiently addressed. To that end, we explore how the autonomous design of a VE can affect emotional engagement and well-being. We present Mood Worlds – a VR application allowing users to visualise their emotions by self-creating a VE. In an exploratory evaluation (N=16), we found that Mood Worlds is an effective tool supporting emotional engagement. Additionally, we found that an autonomous creation process in VR increases positive emotions and well-being. Our work shows that VR can be an effective tool to visualise emotions, thereby increasing positive affect. We discuss opportunities and design requirements for VR as positive technology.

VRception: Rapid prototyping of cross-reality systems in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501821,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501821,"
Cross-reality systems empower users to transition along the reality-virtuality continuum or collaborate with others experiencing different manifestations of it. However, prototyping these systems is challenging, as it requires sophisticated technical skills, time, and often expensive hardware. We present VRception, a concept and toolkit for quick and easy prototyping of cross-reality systems. By simulating all levels of the reality-virtuality continuum entirely in Virtual Reality, our concept overcomes the asynchronicity of realities, eliminating technical obstacles. Our VRception Toolkit leverages this concept to allow rapid prototyping of cross-reality systems and easy remixing of elements from all continuum levels. We replicated six cross-reality papers using our toolkit and presented them to their authors. Interviews with them revealed that our toolkit sufficiently replicates their core functionalities and allows quick iterations. Additionally, remote participants used our toolkit in pairs to collaboratively implement prototypes in about eight minutes that they would have otherwise expected to take days.

Towards understanding diminished reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517452,9,https://scholar.archive.org/work/prqgbd3mljftrjkfgnsela3gqu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517452,"
 Diminished reality (DR) refers to the concept of removing content from a user’s visual environment. While its implementation is becoming feasible, it is still unclear how users perceive and interact in DR-enabled environments and what applications it benefits. To address this challenge, we first conduct a formative study to compare user perceptions of DR and mediated reality effects (e. g., changing the color or size of target elements) in four example scenarios. Participants preferred removing objects through opacity reduction (i. e., the standard DR implementation) and appreciated mechanisms for maintaining a contextual understanding of diminished items (e. g., outlining). In a second study, we explore the user experience of performing tasks within DR-enabled environments. Participants selected which objects to diminish and the magnitude of the effects when performing two separate tasks (video viewing, assembly). Participants were comfortable with decreased contextual understanding, particularly for less mobile tasks. Based on the results, we define guidelines for creating general DR-enabled environments.

Flavorium: an exploration of Flavobacteria's living aesthetics for living color interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517713,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3517713,"
 Flavobacteria, which can be found in marine environments, are able to grow in highly organized colonies producing vivid iridescent colorations. While much is known about the biology of these organisms, their design potential as responsive media in user interfaces has not been explored. Our paper aims at bridging this gap by providing insights into the type, degree, and duration of change in Flavobacteria’s expression, i.e., their living aesthetics. We present a tool to capture and characterize these changes concerning form, texture and iridescent color. To support the long-term study of their living aesthetics, we designed Flavorium. This bio-digital artifact provides the necessary habitat conditions for Flavobacteria to thrive for a month. Granting insights into the responsive behavior of this organism, this work presents a design space, vocabulary, and application concepts to inspire HCI and design scholars to investigate the complex temporal qualities of living media for future user interfaces.

Design of digital workplace stress-reduction intervention systems: Effects of intervention type and timing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502027,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502027,"
Workplace stress-reduction interventions have produced mixed results due to engagement and adherence barriers. Leveraging technology to integrate such interventions into the workday may address these barriers and help mitigate the mental, physical, and monetary effects of workplace stress. To inform the design of a workplace stress-reduction intervention system, we conducted a four-week longitudinal study with 86 participants, examining the effects of intervention type and timing on usage, stress reduction impact, and user preferences. We compared three intervention types and two delivery timing conditions: Pre-scheduled (PS) by users and Just-in-time (JIT) prompted by the system-identified user stress-levels. We found JIT participants completed significantly more interventions than PS participants, but post-intervention and study-long stress reduction was not significantly different between conditions. Participants rated low-effort interventions highest, but high-effort interventions reduced the most stress. Participants felt JIT provided accountability but desired partial agency over timing. We present type and timing implications.

Mixing in reverse optical flow to mitigate vection and simulation sickness in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501847,12,https://scholar.archive.org/work/dbgsrvbwtrhn5mxezpr7gmzezy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501847,"
 Simulator sickness has been one of the major obstacles toward making virtual reality (VR) widely accepted and used. For example, virtual navigation produces vection, which is the illusion of self-motion as one perceives bodily motion despite no movement actually occurs. This, in turn, causes a sensory conflict between visual and actual (or vestibular) motion and sickness. In this study, we explore a method to reduce simulator sickness by visually mixing the optical flow patterns that are in the reverse direction of the virtual visual motion. As visual motion is mainly detected and perceived by the optical flow, artificial mixing in the reverse flow is hypothesized to induce a cancellation effect, thereby reducing the degree of the conflict with the vestibular sense and sickness. To validate our hypothesis, we developed a real-time algorithm to visualize the reverse optical flow and conducted experiments by comparing the before and after sickness levels in seven virtual navigation conditions. The experimental results confirmed the proposed method was effective for reducing the simulator sickness in a statistically significant manner. However, no dependency to the motion type or degrees of freedom were found. Significant distraction and negative influence to the sense of presence and immersion were observed only when the the artificially added reverse optical flow patterns were rather visually marked with high contrast to the background content.

Vulnerability as an ethical stance in soma design processes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501994,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501994,"
 We articulate vulnerability as an ethical stance in soma design processes and discuss the conditions of its emergence. We argue that purposeful vulnerability – an act of taking risk, exposing oneself, and resigning part of one’s autonomy – is a necessary although often neglected part of design, and specifically soma design, which builds on felt experience and stimulates designers to engage with the non-habitual by challenging norms, habitual movements, and social interactions. With the help of ethnography, video analysis, and micro-phenomenological interviews, we document an early design exploration around drones, describing how vulnerability is accomplished in collaboration between members of the design team and the design materials. We (1) define vulnerability as an active ethical stance; (2) make vulnerability visible as a necessary but often neglected part of an exploratory design process; and (3) discuss the conditions of its emergence, demonstrating the importance of deliberating ethics within the design process.

 Three-dimensional (3D) models have widely been used in medical diagnosis and planning tasks. Haptic virtual reality (VR) interfaces implemented by using VR equipment and haptic devices have previously been proposed for these medical 3D manipulation tasks. They have been found to be faster and more accurate in a medical marking task with novel users, compared with the traditional 2D interaction technique that uses a mouse and a 2D display. In this study, we recruited medical experts who do the medical landmarking task as part of their daily work to examine the performance of haptic VR interfaces and to investigate experts’ user experience. There were no statistically significant differences between the haptic user interfaces and the mouse-based 2D interface in terms of task completion time and marking accuracy. Based on experts’ subjective data, haptic VR interfaces showed great potential for medical work because of the natural input methods and haptic feedback.

“I Don't Even Remember What I Read”: How Design Influences Dissociation on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501899,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501899,"
Many people have experienced mindlessly scrolling on social media. We investigated these experiences through the lens of normative dissociation: total cognitive absorption, characterized by diminished self-awareness and reduced sense of agency. To explore user experiences of normative dissociation and how design affects the likelihood of normative dissociation, we deployed Chirp, a custom Twitter client, to 43 U.S. participants. Experience sampling and interviews revealed that sometimes, becoming absorbed in normative dissociation on social media felt like a beneficial break. However, people also reported passively slipping into normative dissociation, such that they failed to absorb any content and were left feeling like they had wasted their time. We found that designed interventions–including custom lists, reading history labels, time limit dialogs, and usage statistics–reduced normative dissociation. Our findings demonstrate that interaction designs intended to capture attention likely do so by harnessing people’s natural inclination to seek normative dissociation experiences. This suggests that normative dissociation may be a more productive framing than addiction for discussing social media overuse.

Enabling hand gesture customization on wrist-worn devices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501904,14,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501904,"
We present a framework for gesture customization requiring minimal examples from users, all without degrading the performance of existing gesture sets. To achieve this, we first deployed a large-scale study (N=500+) to collect data and train an accelerometer-gyroscope recognition model with a cross-user accuracy of 95.7% and a false-positive rate of 0.6 per hour when tested on everyday non-gesture data. Next, we design a few-shot learning framework which derives a lightweight model from our pre-trained model, enabling knowledge transfer without performance degradation. We validate our approach through a user study (N=20) examining on-device customization from 12 new gestures, resulting in an average accuracy of 55.3%, 83.1%, and 87.2% on using one, three, or five shots when adding a new gesture, while maintaining the same recognition accuracy and false-positive rate from the pre-existing gesture set. We further evaluate the usability of our real-time implementation with a user experience study (N=20). Our results highlight the effectiveness, learnability, and usability of our customization framework. Our approach paves the way for a future where users are no longer bound to pre-existing gestures, freeing them to creatively introduce new gestures tailored to their preferences and abilities.

 Mobile apps are indispensable for people’s daily life. Complementing with automated GUI testing, manual testing is the last line of defence for app quality. However, the repeated actions and easily missing of functionalities make manual testing time-consuming and inefficient. Inspired by the game candy crush with flashy candies as hint moves for players, we propose an approach named NaviDroid for navigating testers via highlighted next operations for more effective and efficient testing. Within NaviDroid, we construct an enriched state transition graph with the triggering actions as the edges for two involved states. Based on it, we utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to plan the exploration path, and augment the GUI with visualized hints for testers to quickly explore untested activities and avoid duplicate explorations. The automated experiments demonstrate the high coverage and efficient path planning of NaviDroid and a user study further confirms its usefulness. The NaviDroid can help us develop more robust software that works in more mission-critical settings, not only by performing more thorough testing with the same effort that has been put in before, but also by integrating these techniques into different parts of development pipeline.

How will vr enter university classrooms? multi-stakeholders investigation of vr in higher education,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517542,9,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10329152,"
 VR has received increased attention as an educational tool and many argue it is destined to influence educational practices, especially with the emergence of the Metaverse. Most prior research on educational VR reports on applications or systems designed for specified educational or training objectives. However, it is also crucial to understand current practices and attitudes across disciplines, having a holistic view to extend the body of knowledge in terms of VR adoption in an authentic setting. Taking a higher-level perception of people in different roles, we conducted a qualitative analysis based on 23 interviews with major stakeholders and a series of participatory design workshops with instructors and students. We identified the stakeholders who need to be considered for using VR in higher education, and highlighted the challenges and opportunities critical for VR current and potential practices in the university classroom. Finally, we discussed the design implications based on our findings. This study contributes a detailed description of current perceptions and considerations from a multi-stakeholder perspective, providing new empirical insights for designing novel VR and HCI technologies in higher education.

Speeding up inference with user simulators through policy modulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502023,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502023,"
 The simulation of user behavior with deep reinforcement learning agents has shown some recent success. However, the inverse problem, that is, inferring the free parameters of the simulator from observed user behaviors, remains challenging to solve. This is because the optimization of the new action policy of the simulated agent, which is required whenever the model parameters change, is computationally impractical. In this study, we introduce a network modulation technique that can obtain a generalized policy that immediately adapts to the given model parameters. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed technique improves the efficiency of user simulator-based inference by eliminating the need to obtain an action policy for novel model parameters. We validated our approach using the latest user simulator for point-and-click behavior. Consequently, we succeeded in inferring the user’s cognitive parameters and intrinsic reward settings with less than 1/1000 computational power to those of existing methods.

Increasing adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) systems in various fields has created the need for collaborative work and communication. Today, asymmetric communication between a VR user and other non-VR users remains a challenge. The VR user cannot see the external non-VR users, and the non-VR users are restricted to the VR user’s first-person view. To address this, we propose WebTransceiVR, an asymmetric collaboration toolkit which when integrated into a VR application, allows multiple non-VR users to share the virtual space of the VR user. It allows external users to enter and be part of the VR application’s space through standard web browsers on mobile and computers. These external users can explore and interact with the other users, the VR scene as well as the VR user. WebTransceiVR also includes a cloud-based streaming solution that enables many passive spectators to view the scene through any of the active cameras. We conduct informal user testing to gain additional insights for future work.

On how novices approach programming exercises before and during coding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519655,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/zfj2xv25avhjzinn6hyj34l6bu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519655,"
 Various tools and approaches are available to support undergraduate students learning to program. Most of them concentrate on the code and aim to ease the visualization of data structures or guide the debugging. However, in undergraduate introductory courses, students are typically given exercises in the form of a natural language problem. Deriving a correct solution largely depends on the problem-solving strategy they adopt rather than on their proficiency in dealing with the syntax and semantics of the code. Indeed, they face various challenges (apart from the coding), such as identifying the relevant information, stating the algorithmic steps to solve it, breaking it into smaller parts, and evaluating the implemented solution. To our knowledge, almost no attention has been paid to supporting such problem-solving strategies before and during the coding. This paper reports an interview and a sketching exercise with 10 participants exploring how the novices approach the programming exercises from a problem-solving perspective and how they imagine a tool to support their cognitive process. Findings show that students intuitively perform various actions over the exercise text, and they would appreciate having support from the development environment. Accordingly, based on these findings, we provide implications for designing tools to support problem-solving strategies.

 Recently, chatbots have been deployed in health care in various ways such as providing educational information, and monitoring and triaging symptoms. However, they can be ineffective when they are designed without a careful consideration of the cultural context of the users, especially for marginalized groups. Chatbots designed without cultural understanding may result in loss of trust and disengagement of the user. In this paper, through an interview study, we attempt to understand how chatbots can be better designed for Black American communities within the context of COVID-19. Along with the interviews, we performed design activities with 18 Black Americans that allowed them to envision and design their own chatbot to address their needs and challenges during the pandemic. We report our findings on our participants’ needs for chatbots’ roles and features, and their challenges in using chatbots. We then present design implications for future chatbot design for the Black American population.

Six Facets of Facilitation: Participatory Design Facilitators' Perspectives on Their Role and Its Realization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502013,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502013,"
Participatory design facilitators have a significant impact on participatory activities, processes, and outcomes. However, the facilitator role has not yet been thoroughly debated in existing design discourse, and support for role-related reflections is limited. As the first steps towards an enriched collective understanding of this specific role and its realization, we interviewed 14 respondents with an academic background in participatory design and extensive facilitation experience. Based on a content analysis of the interviews, we identified six facets of the role: (1) trust builder, (2) enabler, (3) inquirer, (4) direction setter, (5) value provider, and (6) users’ advocate. Each facet is presented as consisting of the respondents’ perceived associated responsibilities and corresponding strategies. Our results paint a complex picture of participatory design facilitation. We propose the multi-faceted understanding of the facilitator role emerging from this work as a basis for problematized reflection on the role and its realization.

Family as a Third Space for AI Literacies: How do children and parents learn about AI together?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502031,19,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502031,"
 Many families engage daily with artificial intelligence (AI) applications, from conversations with a voice assistant to mobile navigation searches. While there are known ways for youth to learn about AI, we do not yet understand how to engage parents in this process. To explore parents’ roles in helping their children develop AI literacies, we designed 11 learning activities organized into four topics: image classification, object recognition, interaction with voice assistants, and unplugged AI co-design. We conducted a 5-week online in-home study with 18 children (5 to 11 years old) and 16 parents. We identify parents’ most common roles in supporting their children and consider the benefits of parent-child partnerships when learning AI literacies. Finally, we discuss how our different activities supported parents’ roles and present design recommendations for future family-centered AI literacies resources.

MultiFingerBubble: A 3D Bubble Cursor Variation for Dense Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519692,3,https://inria.hal.science/hal-04008734/document,"
In this work, we propose MultiFingerBubble, a new variation of the 3D Bubble Cursor. The 3D Bubble Cursor is sensitive to distractors in dense environments: the volume selection resizes to snap-to nearby targets. To prevent the cursor to constantly re-snap to neighboring targets, MultiFingerBubble includes multiple targets in the volume selection, and hence increases the targets effective width. Each target in the volume selection is associated with a specific finger. Users can then select a target by flexing its corresponding finger. We report on a controlled in-lab experiment to explore various design options regarding the number of fingers to use, and the target-to-finger mapping and its visualization. Our study results suggest that MultiFingerBubble is best used with three fingers and colored lines to reveal the mapping between targets and fingers.

"Negative emotions, positive outcomes? exploring the communication of negativity in serious data stories",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517530,10,https://idvxlab.com/papers/2022CHI_Negativity_Lan.pdf,"
 Recent work has highlighted that emotion is key to the user experience with data stories. However, limited attention has been paid to negative emotions specifically. This work investigates the outcomes of negative emotions in the context of serious data stories and examines how they can be augmented by design methods from the perspectives of both storytellers and viewers. First, we conducted a workshop with 9 data story experts to understand the possible benefits of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories and 19 potential design methods that contribute to negative emotions. Based on the findings from the workshop, we then conducted a lab study with 35 participants to explore the outcomes of eliciting negative emotions as well as the effectiveness of the design methods. The results indicated that negative emotions mainly facilitated contemplative experiences and long-term memory. Besides, the design methods showed varied effectiveness in augmenting negative emotions and being recalled.

ASTEROIDS: Exploring Swarms of Mini-Telepresence Robots for Physical Skill Demonstration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501927,10,https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~jiannanli/resources/2022-chi-asteroids.pdf,"
Online synchronous tutoring allows for immediate engagement between instructors and audiences over distance. However, tutoring physical skills remains challenging because current telepresence approaches may not allow for adequate spatial awareness, viewpoint control of the demonstration activities scattered across an entire work area, and the instructor’s sufficient awareness of the audience. We present Asteroids, a novel approach for tangible robotic telepresence, to enable workbench-scale physical embodiments of remote people and tangible interactions by the instructor. With Asteroids, the audience can actively control a swarm of mini-telepresence robots, change camera positions, and switch to other robots’ viewpoints. Demonstrators can perceive the audiences’ physical presence while using tangible manipulations to control the audience’s viewpoints and presentation flow. We conducted an exploratory evaluation for Asteroids with 12 remote participants in a model-making tutorial scenario with an architectural expert demonstrator. Results suggest our unique features benefitted participants’ engagement, sense of presence, and understanding.

"A study of UX practitioners roles in designing real-world, enterprise ML systems",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517607,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sabah-Zdanowska/publication/360331915_A_study_of_UX_practitioners_roles_in_designing_real-world_enterprise_ML_systems/links/63dcc80362d2a24f92f1389f/A-study-of-UX-practitioners-roles-in-designing-real-world-enterprise-ML-systems.pdf,"
 Opportunities for AI and machine learning (ML) are vast in current interactive systems development. However, comparatively little is known about how functionality for the system behind the interface is designed and how design methodologies such as user-centered design have influence. This research focuses on how interdisciplinary teams that include UX practitioners design real-world enterprise ML systems outside of big technology companies. We conducted a survey with product managers, and interviews with interdisciplinary teams and individual UX practitioners. The findings show that nontechnical UX practitioners are highly capable in designing AI/ML systems. In addition to applying UX and interaction design expertise to make decisions regarding functionality, they employ skills that aid collaboration across interdisciplinary teams. However, our findings suggest existing HCI design techniques such as prototyping and simulating complexity of enterprise ML systems are insufficient. We propose adaptations to design practices and conclude that some existing research should be reconsidered.

Understanding crowdsourcing requesters' wage setting behaviors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519660,2,https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8317&context=sis_research,"
 Requesters on crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) compensate workers inadequately. One potential reason for the underpayment is that the AMT’s requester interface provides limited information about estimated wages, preventing requesters from knowing if they are offering a fair piece-rate reward. To assess if presenting wage information affects requesters’ reward setting behaviors, we conducted a controlled study with 63 participants. We had three levels for a between-subjects factor in a mixed design study, where we provided participants with: no wage information, wage point estimate, and wage distribution. Each participant had three stages of adjusting the reward and controlling the estimated wage. Our analysis with Bayesian growth curve modeling suggests that the estimated wage derived from the participant-set reward increased from $2.56/h to $2.69/h and $2.33/h to $2.74/h when we provided point estimate and distribution information respectively. The wage decreased from $2.06/h to $1.99/h in the control condition.

User perspectives and ethical experiences of apps for depression: A qualitative analysis of user reviews,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517498,8,,"
Apps for depression can increase access to mental health care but concerns abound with disparities between academic development of apps and those available through app stores. Reviews highlighted ethical shortcomings of these self-management tools, with a need for greater insight into how ethical issues are experienced by users. We addressed these gaps by exploring user reviews of such apps to better understand user experiences and ethical issues. We conducted a thematic analysis of 2,217 user reviews sampled from 40 depression apps in Google Play and Apple App Store, totaling over 77,500 words. Users reported positive and negative experiences, with ethical implications evident in areas of benefits, adverse effects, access, usability and design, support, commercial models, autonomy, privacy, and transparency. We integrated our elements of ethically designed apps for depression and principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, autonomy, and virtue, and we conclude with implications for ethical design of apps for depression.

Remotely Co-Designing Features for Communication Applications using Automatic Captioning with Deaf and Hearing Pairs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501843,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501843,"
 Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) users face accessibility challenges during in-person and remote meetings. While emerging use of applications incorporating automatic speech recognition (ASR) is promising, more user-interface and user-experience research is needed. While co-design methods could elucidate designs for such applications, COVID-19 has interrupted in-person research. This study describes a novel methodology for conducting online co-design workshops with 18 DHH and hearing participant pairs to investigate ASR-supported mobile and videoconferencing technologies along two design dimensions: Correcting errors in ASR output and implementing notification systems for influencing speaker behaviors. Our methodological findings include an analysis of communication modalities and strategies participants used, use of an online collaborative whiteboarding tool, and how participants reconciled differences in ideas. Finally, we present guidelines for researchers interested in online DHH co-design methodologies, enabling greater geographically diversity among study participants even beyond the current pandemic.

Interactive robotic plastering: Augmented interactive design and fabrication for on-site robotic plastering,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501842,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501842,"
 This paper presents Interactive Robotic Plastering (IRoP), a system enabling designers and skilled workers to engage intuitively with an in-situ robotic plastering process. The research combines three elements: interactive design tools, an augmented reality interface, and a robotic spraying system. Plastering is a complex process relying on tacit knowledge and craftsmanship, making it difficult to simulate and automate. However, our system utilizes a controller-based interaction system to enable diverse users to interactively create articulated plasterwork in-situ. A customizable computational toolset converts human intentions into robotic motions while respecting robotic and material constraints. To accomplish this, we developed both an interactive computational model to translate the data from a motion-tracking system into robotic trajectories using design and editing tools as well as an audio-visual guidance system for in-situ projection. We then conducted two user-studies of designers and skilled workers who used IRoP to design and fabricate a full-scale demonstrator.

Varv: Reprogrammable interactive software as a declarative data structure,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502064,10,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146265/3491102.3502064.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
Most modern applications are immutable and turn-key despite the acknowledged benefits of empowering users to modify their software. Writing extensible software remains challenging, even for expert programmers. Reprogramming or extending existing software is often laborious or wholly blocked, requiring sophisticated knowledge of application architecture or setting up a development environment. We present Varv, a programming model representing reprogrammable interactive software as a declarative data structure. Varv defines interactive applications as a set of concepts that consist of a schema and actions. Applications in Varv support incremental modification, allowing users to reprogram through addition and selectively suppress, modify, or add behavior. Users can define high-level concepts, creating an abstraction layer and effectively a domain-specific language for their application domain, emphasizing reuse and modification. We demonstrate the reprogramming and collaboration capabilities of Varv in two case studies and illustrate how the event engine allows for extensive tooling support.

COVID student study: A year in the life of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of mobile phone sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502043,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502043,"
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the daily life of college students, impacting their social life, education, stress levels and overall mental well-being. We study and assess behavioral changes of N=180 undergraduate college students one year prior to the pandemic as a baseline and then during the first year of the pandemic using mobile phone sensing and behavioral inference. We observe that certain groups of students experience the pandemic very differently. Furthermore, we explore the association of self-reported COVID-19 concern with students’ behavior and mental health. We find that heightened COVID-19 concern is correlated with increased depression, anxiety and stress. We evaluate the performance of different deep learning models to classify student COVID-19 concerns with an AUROC and F1 score of 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. Our study spans a two-year period and provides a number of important insights into the life of college students during this period.

Crystalline: Lowering the Cost for Developers to Collect and Organize Information for Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501968,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501968,"
 Developers perform online sensemaking on a daily basis, such as researching and choosing libraries and APIs. Prior research has introduced tools that help developers capture information from various sources and organize it into structures useful for subsequent decision-making. However, it remains a laborious process for developers to manually identify and clip content, maintaining its provenance and synthesizing it with other content. In this work, we introduce a new system called Crystalline that automatically collects and organizes information into tabular structures as the user searches and browses the web. It leverages natural language processing to automatically group similar criteria together to reduce clutter, and uses passive behavioral signals such as mouse movement and dwell time to infer what information to collect and how to visualize and prioritize it. Our user study suggests that developers are able to create comparison tables about 20% faster with a 60% reduction in operational cost without sacrificing the quality of the tables.

Beyond being real: A sensorimotor control perspective on interactions in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517706,8,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08566,"
 We can create Virtual Reality (VR) interactions that have no equivalent in the real world by remapping spacetime or altering users’ body representation, such as stretching the user’s virtual arm for manipulation of distant objects or scaling up the user’s avatar to enable rapid locomotion. Prior research has leveraged such approaches, what we call beyond-real techniques, to make interactions in VR more practical, efficient, ergonomic, and accessible. We present a survey categorizing prior movement-based VR interaction literature as reality-based, illusory, or beyond-real interactions. We survey relevant conferences (CHI, IEEE VR, VRST, UIST, and DIS) while focusing on selection, manipulation, locomotion, and navigation in VR. For beyond-real interactions, we describe the transformations that have been used by prior works to create novel remappings. We discuss open research questions through the lens of the human sensorimotor control system and highlight challenges that need to be addressed for effective utilization of beyond-real interactions in future VR applications, including plausibility, control, long-term adaptation, and individual differences.

 Dancing is a universal human activity, and also a domain of enduring significance in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. However, there has been limited investigation into how computing supports the experiences of recreational dancers. Concurrently, a diverse and sizeable dance community has been emerging in VRChat. Little is known about these dancers’ experiences, motivations, and practices. Yet shedding light into these could inform both VR technology development and the design of systems that better support embodied and complex social interactions. To bridge this gap, we interviewed participants active in the VRChat dance scene. Through thematic analysis, we identified six central facets of their experiences related to freedom, community, dance as an individual experience, dance as a shared experience, dance as a performance, and self-expression and -exploration. Based on these findings, we discuss emerging tensions and highlight beneficial impacts of dancing in VR as well as problems that still await resolving.

 Crowdworkers silently enable much of today’s AI-based products, with several online platforms offering a myriad of data labelling and content moderation tasks through convenient labour marketplaces. The HCI community has been increasingly interested in investigating the worker-centric issues inherent in the current model and seeking for potential improvements that could be implemented in the future. This workshop explores how a reimagined perspective on crowdsourcing platforms could provide a more equitable, fair, and rewarding experience. This includes not only the workers but also the platforms, who could benefit e.g. from better processes for worker onboarding, skills-development, and growth. We invite visionary takes in various formats on this topic to spread awareness of worker-centric research and developments to the CHI community. As a result of interactive ideation work in the workshop, we articulate a future direction roadmap for research centred around crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, as a specific interest area, the workshop seeks to study crowdwork from the context of the Global South, which has been arising as an important but critically understudied crowdsourcing market in recent years.

 Skin is a promising interaction medium and has been widely explored for mobile, and expressive interaction. Recent research in HCI has seen the development of Epidermal Computing Devices: ultra-thin and non-invasive devices which reside on the user’s skin, offering intimate integration with the curved surfaces of the body, while having physical and mechanical properties that are akin to skin, expanding the horizon of on-body interaction. However, with rapid technological advancements in multiple disciplines, we see a need to synthesize the main open research questions and opportunities for the HCI community to advance future research in this area. By systematically analyzing Epidermal Devices contributed in the HCI community, physical sciences research and from our experiences in designing and building Epidermal Devices, we identify opportunities and challenges for advancing research across five themes. This multi-disciplinary synthesis enables multiple research communities to facilitate progression towards more coordinated endeavors for advancing Epidermal Computing.

 The majority of consent pop-ups on the web do not meet the requirements for legally valid consent laid out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In the face of a lack of enforcement, we present the browser extension Consent-O-Matic which uses adversarial interoperability to automatically answer these pop-ups based on the user’s preferences. We document how the current implementation of these pop-ups support and inhibit interoperability, focussing on the difference between static and dynamic HTML, the quality of the semantic markup, and the visibility of the system’s state; and we present the implementation of Consent-O-Matic. Lastly, we discuss the possibilities, limitations, and concerns of an adversarial approach.

 Most video-based learning content is designed for desktops without considering mobile environments. We (1) investigate the gap between mobile learners’ challenges and video engineers’ considerations using mixed methods and (2) provide design guidelines for creating mobile-friendly MOOC videos. To uncover learners’ challenges, we conducted a survey (n=134) and interviews (n=21), and evaluated the mobile adequacy of current MOOCs by analyzing 41,722 video frames from 101 video lectures. Interview results revealed low readability and situationally-induced impairments as major challenges. The content analysis showed a low guideline compliance rate for key design factors. We then interviewed 11 video production engineers to investigate design factors they mainly consider. The engineers mainly focus on the size and amount of content while lacking consideration for color, complex images, and situationally-induced impairments. Finally, we present and validate guidelines for designing mobile-friendly MOOCs, such as providing adaptive and customizable visual design and context-aware accessibility support.

 A key aspect of knowledge work is the analysis and manipulation of sets of related documents. We conducted interviews with 12 patent examiners and 12 scientists and found that all face difficulties using specialized tools for managing text from multiple documents across interconnected activities, including searching, collecting, annotating, organizing, writing and reviewing, while manually tracking their provenance. We introduce Passages, interactive objects that reify text selections and can then be manipulated, reused, and shared across multiple tools. Passages directly supports the above-listed activities as well as fluid transitions among them. Two user studies show that participants found Passages both elegant and powerful, facilitating their work practices and enabling greater reuse and novel strategies for analyzing and composing documents. We argue that Passages offers a general approach applicable to a wide variety of text-based interactions.

 With the growing smartphone penetration rate, smartphone settings remain one of the main models for information privacy and security controls. Yet, their usability is largely understudied, especially with respect to the usability impact on underrepresented socio-economic and low-tech groups. In an online survey with 178 users, we find that many people are not aware of smartphone privacy and security settings, their defaults, and have not configured them in the past, but are willing to do it in the future. Some participants perceive low self-efficacy and expect difficulties and usability issues with configuring those settings. Finally, we find that certain socio-demographic groups are more vulnerable to risks and feel less prepared to use smartphone settings to protect their online privacy and security.

Three of the most common approaches used in recommender systems are content-based filtering (matching users’ preferences with products’ characteristics), collaborative filtering (matching users with similar preferences), and demographic filtering (catering to users based on demographic characteristics). Do users’ intuitions lead them to trust one of these approaches over others, independent of the actual operations of these different systems? Does their faith in one type or another depend on the quality of the recommendation, rather than how the recommendation appears to have been derived? We conducted an empirical study with a prototype of a movie recommender system to find out. A 3 (Ostensible Recommender Type: Content vs. Collaborative vs. Demographic Filtering) x 2 (Recommendation Quality: Good vs. Bad) experiment (N=226) investigated how users evaluate systems and attribute responsibility for the recommendations they receive. We found that users trust systems that use collaborative filtering more, regardless of the system's performance. They think that they themselves are responsible for good recommendations but that the system is responsible for bad recommendations (reflecting a self-serving bias). Theoretical insights, design implications and practical solutions for the cold start problem are discussed.

 The Amazon Alexa voice assistant provides convenience through automation and control of smart home appliances using voice commands. Amazon allows third-party applications known as skills to run on top of Alexa to further extend Alexa’s capability. However, as multiple skills can share the same invocation phrase and request access to sensitive user data, growing security and privacy concerns surround third-party skills. In this paper, we study the availability and effectiveness of existing security indicators or a lack thereof to help users properly comprehend the risk of interacting with different types of skills. We conduct an interactive user study (inviting active users of Amazon Alexa) where participants listen to and interact with real-world skills using the official Alexa app. We find that most participants fail to identify the skill developer correctly (i.e., they assume Amazon also develops the third-party skills) and cannot correctly determine which skills will be automatically activated through the voice interface. We also propose and evaluate a few voice-based skill type indicators, showcasing how users would benefit from such voice-based indicators.

Recent advances have enabled automatic sound recognition systems for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) users on mobile devices. However, these tools use pre-trained, generic sound recognition models, which do not meet the diverse needs of DHH users. We introduce ProtoSound, an interactive system for customizing sound recognition models by recording a few examples, thereby enabling personalized and fine-grained categories. ProtoSound is motivated by prior work examining sound awareness needs of DHH people and by a survey we conducted with 472 DHH participants. To evaluate ProtoSound, we characterized performance on two real-world sound datasets, showing significant improvement over state-of-the-art (e.g., +9.7% accuracy on the first dataset). We then deployed ProtoSound's end-user training and real-time recognition through a mobile application and recruited 19 hearing participants who listened to the real-world sounds and rated the accuracy across 56 locations (e.g., homes, restaurants, parks). Results show that ProtoSound personalized the model on-device in real-time and accurately learned sounds across diverse acoustic contexts. We close by discussing open challenges in personalizable sound recognition, including the need for better recording interfaces and algorithmic improvements.

 When considering the democratic intentions of co-design, designers and design researchers must evaluate the impact of power imbalances embedded in common design and research dynamics. This holds particularly true in work with and for marginalized communities, who are frequently excluded in design processes. To address this issue, we examine how existing design tools and methods are used to support communities in processes of community building or reimagining, considering the influence of race and identity. This paper describes our findings from 27 interviews with community design practitioners conducted to evaluate the Building Utopia toolkit, which employs an Afrofuturist lens for speculative design processes. Our research findings support the importance of design tools that prompt conversations on race in design, and tensions between the desire for imaginative design practice and the immediacy of social issues, particularly when designing with Black and brown communities.

Speech and voice interaction is often hailed as a natural form of interaction and thus more inclusive for a larger portion of users. But, how accurate is this claim? In this panel, we challenge existing assumptions that voice and speech interaction is inclusive of diverse users. The goal of this panel is to bring together the broad HCI community to discuss the state of voice interaction for marginalized and vulnerable populations, how inclusive design is considered (or neglected) in current voice interaction design practice, and how to move forward when it comes to designing voice interaction for inclusion and diversity. In particular, we plan to center the discussion on older adults as a representative group of digitally-marginalized populations, especially given that voice interfaces are marketed towards this group, yet often fail to properly include this population in the design of such interfaces.

End-users can potentially style and customize websites by editing them through in-browser developer tools. Unfortunately, end-users lack the knowledge needed to translate high-level styling goals into low-level code edits. We present Stylette, a browser extension that enables users to change the style of websites by expressing goals in natural language. By interpreting the user’s goal with a large language model and extracting suggestions from our dataset of 1.7 million web components, Stylette generates a palette of CSS properties and values that the user can apply to reach their goal. A comparative study (N=40) showed that Stylette lowered the learning curve, helping participants perform styling changes 35% faster than those using developer tools. By presenting various alternatives for a single goal, the tool helped participants familiarize themselves with CSS through experimentation. Beyond CSS, our work can be expanded to help novices quickly grasp complex software or programming languages.

 The ability to manage emotions effectively is critical to healthy psychological and social development in youth. Prior work has focused on investigating the design of mental health technologies for this population, yet it is still unclear how to help them cope with emotionally difficult situations in-the-moment. In this paper, we aim to explore the appropriation, naturally emerging engagement patterns, and perceived psychological impact of an exemplar interactive tangible device intervention designed to provide in-situ support, when deployed with n=109 youth for 1.5 months. Our findings from semi-structured interviews and co-design workshops with a subset of participants (n=44 and n=25, respectively) suggest the potential of using technology-enabled objects to aid with down-regulation and self-compassion in moments of heightened emotion, to facilitate the practice of cognitive strategies, and to act as emotional companions.

Automating Contextual Privacy Policies: Design and Evaluation of a Production Tool for Digital Consumer Privacy Awareness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517688,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517688,"
 Users avoid engaging with privacy policies because they are lengthy and complex, making it challenging to retrieve relevant information. In response, research proposed contextual privacy policies (CPPs) that embed relevant privacy information directly into their affiliated contexts. To date, CPPs are limited to concept showcases. This work evolves CPPs into a production tool that automatically extracts and displays concise policy information. We first evaluated the technical functionality on the US’s 500 most visited websites with 59 participants. Based on our results, we further revised the tool to deploy it in the wild with 11 participants over ten days. We found that our tool is effective at embedding CPP information on websites. Moreover, we found that the tool’s usage led to more reflective privacy behavior, making CPPs powerful in helping users understand the consequences of their online activities. We contribute design implications around CPP presentation to inform future systems design.

TapType: Ten-finger text entry on everyday surfaces via Bayesian inference,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501878,8,https://paulstreli.com/assets/papers/chi2022-taptype.pdf,"
Despite the advent of touchscreens, typing on physical keyboards remains most efficient for entering text, because users can leverage all fingers across a full-size keyboard for convenient typing. As users increasingly type on the go, text input on mobile and wearable devices has had to compromise on full-size typing. In this paper, we present TapType, a mobile text entry system for full-size typing on passive surfaces—without an actual keyboard. From the inertial sensors inside a band on either wrist, TapType decodes and relates surface taps to a traditional QWERTY keyboard layout. The key novelty of our method is to predict the most likely character sequences by fusing the finger probabilities from our Bayesian neural network classifier with the characters’ prior probabilities from an n-gram language model. In our online evaluation, participants on average typed 19 words per minute with a character error rate of 0.6% after 30 minutes of training. Expert typists thereby consistently achieved more than 25 WPM at a similar error rate. We demonstrate applications of TapType in mobile use around smartphones and tablets, as a complement to interaction in situated Mixed Reality outside visual control, and as an eyes-free mobile text input method using an audio feedback-only interface.

How can Explainability Methods be Used to Support Bug Identification in Computer Vision Models?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517474,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517474,"
 Deep learning models for image classification suffer from dangerous issues often discovered after deployment. The process of identifying bugs that cause these issues remains limited and understudied. Especially, explainability methods are often presented as obvious tools for bug identification. Yet, the current practice lacks an understanding of what kind of explanations can best support the different steps of the bug identification process, and how practitioners could interact with those explanations. Through a formative study and an iterative co-creation process, we build an interactive design probe providing various potentially relevant explainability functionalities, integrated into interfaces that allow for flexible workflows. Using the probe, we perform 18 user-studies with a diverse set of machine learning practitioners. Two-thirds of the practitioners engage in successful bug identification. They use multiple types of explanations, e.g. visual and textual ones, through non-standardized sequences of interactions including queries and exploration. Our results highlight the need for interactive, guiding, interfaces with diverse explanations, shedding light on future research directions.

"Unpacking invisible work practices, constraints, and latent power relationships in child welfare through casenote analysis",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517742,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517742,"
 Caseworkers are trained to write detailed narratives about families in Child-Welfare (CW) which informs collaborative high-stakes decision-making. Unlike other administrative data, these narratives offer a more credible source of information with respect to workers’ interactions with families as well as underscore the role of systemic factors in decision-making. SIGCHI researchers have emphasized the need to understand human discretion at the street-level to be able to design human-centered algorithms for the public sector. In this study, we conducted computational text analysis of casenotes at a child-welfare agency in the midwestern United States and highlight patterns of invisible street-level discretionary work and latent power structures that have direct implications for algorithm design. Casenotes offer a unique lens for policymakers and CW leadership towards understanding the experiences of on-the-ground caseworkers. As a result of this study, we highlight how street-level discretionary work needs to be supported by sociotechnical systems developed through worker-centered design. This study offers the first computational inspection of casenotes and introduces them to the SIGCHI community as a critical data source for studying complex sociotechnical systems.

Diff in the loop: Supporting data comparison in exploratory data analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502123,10,https://willepperson.com/papers/ditl-chi22.pdf,"
 Data science is characterized by evolution: since data science is exploratory, results evolve from moment to moment; since it can be collaborative, results evolve as the work changes hands. While existing tools help data scientists track changes in code, they provide less support for understanding the iterative changes that the code produces in the data. We explore the idea of visualizing differences in datasets as a core feature of exploratory data analysis, a concept we call Diff in the Loop (DITL). We evaluated DITL in a user study with 16 professional data scientists and found it helped them understand the implications of their actions when manipulating data. We summarize these findings and discuss how the approach can be generalized to different data science workflows.

Exploring spatial ui transition mechanisms with head-worn augmented reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517723,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517723,"
 Imagine in the future people comfortably wear augmented reality (AR) displays all day, how do we design interfaces that adapt to the contextual changes as people move around? In current operating systems, the majority of AR content defaults to staying at a fixed location until being manually moved by the users. However, this approach puts the burden of user interface (UI) transition solely on users. In this paper, we first ran a bodystorming design workshop to capture the limitations of existing manual UI transition approaches in spatially diverse tasks. Then we addressed these limitations by designing and evaluating three UI transition mechanisms with different levels of automation and controllability (low-effort manual, semi-automated, fully-automated). Furthermore, we simulated imperfect contextual awareness by introducing prediction errors with different costs to correct them. Our results provide valuable lessons about the trade-offs between UI automation levels, controllability, user agency, and the impact of prediction errors.

"“All that You Touch, You Change”: Expanding the Canon of Speculative Design Towards Black Futuring",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502118,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502118,"
 Traditional approaches to technology design have historically ignored Blackness in both who engages and conceptualizes future technologies. Design contributions of groups marginalized along race and class are often othered, and rarely considered the design standard. While frameworks have emerged to encourage attention to gender and social justice in design, little work has acknowledged evidence of the Black imaginary in this process. The current canon of design defines futuring and speculation as stemming from a narrow view of science fiction, one which does not include Black futurist perspectives. In this essay, we expand the canon of design by arguing that frameworks such as Afrofuturism, Afrofuturist feminism, and Black feminism be considered instrumental in design’s imagining of our future technological landscape. We contribute to the larger conversation of who gets to future in design, suggesting a dialogic relationship between those who conceptualize design and those who consider design’s societal impact.

Impacts of personal characteristics on user trust in conversational recommender systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517471,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517471,"
Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) imitate human advisors to assist users in finding items through conversations and have recently gained increasing attention in domains such as media and e-commerce. Like in human communication, building trust in human-agent communication is essential given its significant influence on user behavior. However, inspiring user trust in CRSs with a “one-size-fits-all” design is difficult, as individual users may have their own expectations for conversational interactions (e.g., who, user or system, takes the initiative), which are potentially related to their personal characteristics. In this study, we investigated the impacts of three personal characteristics, namely personality traits, trust propensity, and domain knowledge, on user trust in two types of text-based CRSs, i.e., user-initiative and mixed-initiative. Our between-subjects user study (N=148) revealed that users’ trust propensity and domain knowledge positively influenced their trust in CRSs, and that users with high conscientiousness tended to trust the mixed-initiative system.

It is often assumed that imagery provides an easy or universal mode of communication, but when we imagine our worlds through sketches, visualizations, and comics are we leaving anyone behind? The visual world is rich, it transcends boundaries and connects us... but not all of us. To be able to create an image or visualize something is a skill, but to be able to view and interpret that image is a privilege: how can we bridge the gap between visual and textual interpretation? We propose that alt-narrative could bridge the gap between visual communication and imagery to connect everyone in storytelling, visualization, and thought. This AltCHI paper puts forward exploration of the AltNarrative method in HCI imagery and comics. To engage with this research, the reader should either activate their computer or smart device screen reader or open in Adobe Acrobat in Mac or Windows then activate Read Out loud.

“I Will Not Drink With You Today”: A Topic-Guided Thematic Analysis of Addiction Recovery on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502076,13,https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/17742/chi22-256.pdf?sequence=1,"
 Recovery from addiction is a journey that requires a lifetime of support from a strong network of peers. Many people seek out this support through online communities, like those on Reddit. However, as these communities developed outside of existing aid groups and medical practice, it is unclear how they enable recovery. Their scale also limits researchers’ ability to engage through traditional qualitative research methods. To study these groups, we performed a topic-guided thematic analysis that used machine-generated topic models to purposively sample from two recovery subreddits: r/stopdrinking and r/OpiatesRecovery. We show that these communities provide access to an experienced and accessible support group whose discussions include consequences, reflections, and celebrations, but that also play a distinct metacommunicative role in supporting formal treatment. We discuss how these communities can act as knowledge sources to improve in-person recovery support and medical practice, and how computational techniques can enable HCI researchers to study communities at scale.

FlatMagic: Improving flat colorization through AI-driven design for digital comic professionals,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502075,12,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502075,"
 Creating digital comics involves multiple stages, some creative and some menial. For example, coloring a comic requires a labor-intensive stage known as ‘flatting,’ or masking segments of continuous color, as well as creative shading, lighting, and stylization stages. The use of AI can automate the colorization process, but early efforts have revealed limitations—technical and UX—to full automation. Via a formative study of professionals, we identify flatting as a bottleneck and key target of opportunity for human-guided AI-driven automation. Based on this insight, we built FlatMagic, an interactive, AI-driven flat colorization support tool for Photoshop. Our user studies found that using FlatMagic significantly reduced professionals’ real and perceived effort versus their current practice. While participants effectively used FlatMagic, we also identified potential constraints in interactions with AI and partially automated workflows. We reflect on implications for comic-focused tools and the benefits and pitfalls of intermediate representations and partial automation in designing human-AI collaboration tools for professionals.

Effects of field of view on egocentric distance perception in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517548,10,http://eecs.ucf.edu/isuelab/publications/pubs/Masnadi2022.pdf,"
 We performed a mixed-design study with 56 participants to compare the effect of horizontal FOV (hfov) and vertical FOV (vfov) on egocentric distance perception in four different realistic virtual environments (VEs). We also compared VE attributes of indoor/outdoor and cluttered/uncluttered. The participants blind-walked towards four different targets at 3m, 4m, 5m, and 6m distance while wearing a backpack computer and a wide FOV head-mounted display (HMD). The combinations of 165°, 110° and 45° hfovs, and 110° and 35° vfovs was simulated in the same HMD. The results indicated more accurate distance judgement with larger hfov with no significant effect of vfov. More accurate distance judgement in indoor VEs compared to outdoor VEs was observed. Also, participants judged distances more accurately in cluttered environments versus uncluttered environments. These results highlight that the environment is important in distance-critical VR applications and wider hfov should be considered for an improved distance judgment.

 This interactivity demonstration provides users with a visualization of their conversational turn-taking, within a shared Virtual Reality (VR) environment. It is intended to help support balanced communication in remote meetings. This prototype is part of a larger research project focused on developing VR tools to improve online meetings with designed affordances that take advantage of VR’s unique properties to help people with balancing participation, time management, coming to shared decisions, following an agenda, and achieving social connection and support for ideas. Ultimately, these prototypes help show the potential for using VR to make online meetings more effective and satisfying. At CHI, users will have a chance to try out the conversation balance system either in-person at the conference venue, or as a remote group if they are attending virtually.

Patch-O: Deformable Woven Patches for On-body Actuation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517633,9,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10336212,"
We present Patch-O, a novel deformable interface devised as a woven patch that enables diverse movement-based interactions adaptive to garments or on-skin wearing. Patch-O interfaces are uniquely detachable and relocatable soft actuation units that can be sewn or attached to clothing or skin at various locations. To optimize the morphing effect while preserving a slim form factor, we introduce a construction approach that integrates actuators at a structural level and varies the texture and stiffness of the woven substrate locally. We implement three basic actuation primitives, including bending, expanding, and shrinking, and experiment with aggregation parameters to exhaustively extend the design space. A final workshop study inviting textile practitioners to create personalized designs of Patch-O provides insights into the expressiveness of the approach for wearable interactions. We conclude with three applications inspired by users’ designs and showcase the aesthetic and functional usages enabled by the deformable woven patches.

Understanding interactions for smart wheelchair navigation in crowds,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502085,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502085,"
 Shared control wheelchairs can help users to navigate through crowds by enabling the person to drive the wheelchair while receiving support in avoiding pedestrians. To date, research into shared control has largely overlooked the perspectives of wheelchair users. In this paper, we present two studies that aim to address this gap. The first study involved a series of semi-structured interviews with wheelchair users which highlighted the presence of two different interaction loops, one between the user and the wheelchair and a second one between the user and the crowd. In the second study we engaged with wheelchair users and designers to co-design appropriate feedback loops for future shared control interaction interfaces. Based on the results of the co-design session, we present design implications for shared control wheelchair around the need for empathy, embodiment and social awareness; situational awareness and adaptability; and selective information management.

EmoGlass: An end-to-end AI-enabled wearable platform for enhancing self-awareness of emotional health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501925,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501925,"
Often, emotional disorders are overlooked due to their lack of awareness, resulting in potential mental issues. Recent advances in sensing and inference technology provide a viable path to wearable facial-expression-based emotion recognition. However, most prior work has explored only laboratory settings and few platforms are geared towards end-users in everyday lives or provide personalized emotional suggestions to promote self-regulation. We present EmoGlass, an end-to-end wearable platform that consists of emotion detection glasses and an accompanying mobile application. Our single-camera-mounted glasses can detect seven facial expressions based on partial face images. We conducted a three-day out-of-lab study (N=15) to evaluate the performance of EmoGlass. We iterated on the design of the EmoGlass application for effective self-monitoring and awareness of users’ daily emotional states. We report quantitative and qualitative findings, based on which we discuss design recommendations for future work on sensing and enhancing awareness of emotional health.

Improving understandability of feature contributions in model-agnostic explainable AI tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517650,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517650,"
 Model-agnostic explainable AI tools explain their predictions by means of ’local’ feature contributions. We empirically investigate two potential improvements over current approaches. The first one is to always present feature contributions in terms of the contribution to the outcome that is perceived as positive by the user (“positive framing”). The second one is to add “semantic labeling”, that explains the directionality of each feature contribution (“this feature leads to +5% eligibility”), reducing additional cognitive processing steps. In a user study, participants evaluated the understandability of explanations for different framing and labeling conditions for loan applications and music recommendations. We found that positive framing improves understandability even when the prediction is negative. Additionally, adding semantic labels eliminates any framing effects on understandability, with positive labels outperforming negative labels. We implemented our suggestions in a package ArgueView[11].

” You have to prove the threat is real”: Understanding the needs of Female Journalists and Activists to Document and Report Online Harassment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517517,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517517,"
 Online harassment is a major societal challenge that impacts multiple communities. Some members of community, like female journalists and activists, bear significantly higher impacts since their profession requires easy accessibility, transparency about their identity, and involves highlighting stories of injustice. Through a multi-phased qualitative research study involving a focus group and interviews with 27 female journalists and activists, we mapped the journey of a target who goes through harassment. We introduce PMCR framework, as a way to focus on needs for Prevention, Monitoring, Crisis and Recovery. We focused on Crisis and Recovery, and designed a tool to satisfy a target’s needs related to documenting evidence of harassment during the crisis and creating reports that could be shared with support networks for recovery. Finally, we discuss users’ feedback to this tool, highlighting needs for targets as they face the burden and offer recommendations to future designers and scholars on how to develop tools that can help targets manage their harassment.

Collabally: Accessible collaboration awareness in document editing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517635,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517635,"
 Collaborative document editing tools are widely used in professional and academic workplaces. While these tools provide basic accessibility support, it is challenging for blind users to gain collaboration awareness that sighted people can easily obtain using visual cues (e.g., who is editing where and what). Through a series of co-design sessions with a blind coauthor, we identified the current practices and challenges in collaborative editing, and iteratively designed CollabAlly, a system that makes collaboration awareness in document editing accessible to blind users. CollabAlly extracts collaborator, comment, and text-change information and their context from a document and presents them in a dialog box to provide easy access and navigation. CollabAlly uses earcons to communicate background events unobtrusively, voice fonts to differentiate collaborators, and spatial audio to convey the location of document activity. In a study with 11 blind participants, we demonstrate that CollabAlly provides improved access to collaboration awareness by centralizing scattered information, sonifying visual information, and simplifying complex operations.

 Emotion regulation–managing one’s emotional state in day-to-day life–is an important set of skills for supporting mental wellbeing. We propose to demonstrate our AR Fidget system that scaffolds emotion regulation using a combination of AR glasses and fidgeting actions. AR glasses have been used in various well-being situations for providing the person with unobtrusive and in-the-moment feedback. Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that the manipulation of soft-bodied ‘fidget’ objects helps people manage emotions and improve focus. This project explores whether combining fidgeting behaviors such as swiping, tapping, and clicking with supportive visual/auditory feedback on AR glasses can support emotion regulation in the moment. We will demonstrate three visual/auditory metaphors in the form of AR lenses (Lotus, Bubble, Fire) combined with suggested target fidget actions based on prior research, toward helping people to regulate anxiety, boredom, and anger.

While people’s identities can be marginalized through various forces, colonialism is one of the primary ways that continues to influence people’s lives and identities. Colonialism refers to the policies and practices where foreign powers migrate to other lands and alter the social structures, and thus identities, of local populations. What is less understood is how online spaces can support people in the aftermath of colonization in revising, repairing, and strengthening their identities—the process of identity decolonization work. Using trace ethnography beginning on 15 May, 2020 and ending on 15 July, 2020 and drawing on Poka Laenui’s framework of decolonization, we explore how South Asian Bengalis on the platform Bengali Quora (BnQuora) engage in collaborative identity decolonization work to reclaim narrative agency. We discuss how narratives serve to help people bounce back from threat or vulnerability—a concept we dub narrative resilience. We also describe potential implications for future scholarship focused on decolonization that extends multiple ongoing conversations around ICT for development, social justice, decolonial HCI, and identity research within the CHI community.

 Limited interaction with professionals, infrastructural, and social constraints put barriers in providing holistic support to expectant and new mothers in low-resource settings. We examine the use of digital support groups facilitated through WhatsApp by a non-government organization in India. Complementing prior research, these digital peer support groups inform about an open public space created over a chat platform where rural communities and health professionals can engage. By qualitatively analyzing six months of interaction among 588 group members and collecting the experiences of the group moderators, we inform about how the support groups acted as an important source for compensating the gaps in the existing healthcare, providing reassurance support on routine health, explanation on test reports, validation and counseling support in ongoing treatments. We also derive implications for the future of digital support groups and the need for further research on the use of unplatformed design models in resource-constrained settings.

 Incident response playbooks provide step-by-step guidelines to help security operations personnel quickly respond to specific threat scenarios. Although playbooks are common in the security industry, they have not been empirically evaluated for effectiveness. This paper takes a first step toward measuring playbooks and the frameworks used to design them, using two studies conducted in an enterprise environment. In the first study, twelve security professionals created two playbooks each, using two standard playbook design frameworks; the resulting playbooks were evaluated by experts for accuracy. In the second, we observed five personnel using the created playbooks in no-notice threat exercises within a live security-operations center. We find that playbooks can help simplify and support incident response efforts. However, playbooks designed using the frameworks we examined often lack sufficient detail for real-world use, particularly for more junior technicians. We provide recommendations for improving playbooks, playbook frameworks, and organizational processes surrounding playbook use.

Current research in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (XR) reveals a lack of tool support for designing and, in particular, prototyping XR applications. While recent tools research is often motivated by studying the requirements of non-technical designers and end-user developers, the perspective of industry practitioners is less well understood. In an interview study with 17 practitioners from different industry sectors working on professional XR projects, we establish the design practices in industry, from early project stages to the final product. To better understand XR design challenges, we characterize the different methods and tools used for prototyping and describe the role and use of key prototypes in the different projects. We extract common elements of XR prototyping, elaborating on the tools and materials used for prototyping and establishing different views on the notion of fidelity. Finally, we highlight key issues for future XR tools research.

 Breastfeeding can be challenging, but it is difficult for antenatal education to convey issues associated with the lived experience of breastfeeding. In our work, we explore the potential of interactive simulations to support antenatal education, and present Virtual Feed, a Virtual Reality breastfeeding simulation for parents-to-be developed following a three-step process. (1) We created an experience prototype that features basic VR scenarios and a tangible baby, (2) we engaged in design sessions with 19 parents and parents-to-be to derive design implications to further refine the simulation, and (3) we evaluated the system through case studies to examine the perspectives of parents and parents-to-be on the simulation. Our results show that the simulation successfully engaged users and sparked curiosity, while also encouraging reflection about the challenges of breastfeeding. On this basis, we discuss challenges for the design of simulations with the purpose of supplementing antenatal education.

 Aging in place technologies are designed to extend independence and autonomy in older adults, promoting quality of life and peace of mind. Prior work has described how adoption and continued use of these technologies are low when they are perceived as reinforcing aging stigma or reminding older adults of negative aspects of aging. Building on past research, we investigate older adults’ perceptions of four different kinds of aging in place technologies. Based on in-depth interviews with 18 older adults using a set of scenarios, we describe how different design characteristics contribute to perceived aging stigma. Additionally, we draw on Duner & Nordström’s classification of coping strategies to discuss how specific kinds of technology can best support older adults during different stages of the aging process.

What are you thinking?: Using CBT and Storytelling to Improve Mental Health Among College Students,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517603,9,,"
 Depression and anxiety among college students have been on the rise globally. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has emerged as an empirically reinforced and effective treatment. However, factors like cost, lack of resources, misguided prioritization and stigmatization of mental health issues in the Global South limit students’ access to psychotherapy. While technology can bridge this gap, research shows current self-guided mHealth apps for CBT are not always evidence-based and have limited efficacy compared to therapist-guided alternatives. In this paper, we explore whether interactive storytelling and other gamification mechanisms can increase the efficacy of a self-guided mHealth app, while drawing from empirically supported CBT protocols. We designed an mHealth application with contextualised storylines to help students learn psychological concepts and better identify the negative patterns in their thoughts. We present the results of a 3-arm randomized controlled trial conducted to assess the effect of this application compared to active and inactive control conditions.

Opportunities and challenges of automatic speech recognition systems for low-resource language speakers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517639,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517639,"
 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) researchers are turning their attention towards supporting low-resource languages, such as isiXhosa or Marathi, with only limited training resources. We report and reflect on collaborative research across ASR & HCI to situate ASR-enabled technologies to suit the needs and functions of two communities of low-resource language speakers, on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa and in Mumbai, India. We build on longstanding community partnerships and draw on linguistics, media studies and HCI scholarship to guide our research. We demonstrate diverse design methods to: remotely engage participants; collect speech data to test ASR models; and ultimately field-test models with users. Reflecting on the research, we identify opportunities, challenges, and use-cases of ASR, in particular to support pervasive use of WhatsApp voice messaging. Finally, we uncover implications for collaborations across ASR & HCI that advance important discussions at CHI surrounding data, ethics, and AI.

Causality-preserving asynchronous reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501836,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501836,"
 Mixed Reality is gaining interest as a platform for collaboration and focused work to a point where it may supersede current office settings in future workplaces. At the same time, we expect that interaction with physical objects and face-to-face communication will remain crucial for future work environments, which is a particular challenge in fully immersive Virtual Reality. In this work, we reconcile those requirements through a user’s individual Asynchronous Reality, which enables seamless physical interaction across time. When a user is unavailable, e.g., focused on a task or in a call, our approach captures co-located or remote physical events in real-time, constructs a causality graph of co-dependent events, and lets immersed users revisit them at a suitable time in a causally accurate way. Enabled by our system AsyncReality, we present a workplace scenario that includes walk-in interruptions during a person’s focused work, physical deliveries, and transient spoken messages. We then generalize our approach to a use-case agnostic concept and system architecture. We conclude by discussing the implications of Asynchronous Reality for future offices.

Pneumatic Auxetics: Inverse design and 3D printing of auxetic pattern for pneumatic morphing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519801,3,https://fab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/paper/files/PneumaticAuxetics.pdf,"
This paper presents Pneumatic Auxetics, an inverse optimization method for designing and fabricating morphing three-dimensional shapes out of patterns laid out flat. In origami/kirigami research, optimization of patterns that can be transformed into the target surface by inverse design has been attempted. On the other hand, in the research area of pneumatically actuated geometries, the control of the transformation using skeletons and membranes has been attempted. In the study of the inverse design of the auxetic pattern based on kirigami, it cannot actuate deformation by removing air because the design does not consider the thickness. Therefore, we simulate the pneumatic transition with the thick shell structure that is generated by offsetting the input surface (Figure 1). The designed skeleton is optimized for FGF (Fused Granular Fabrication) 3D printing, and it is 3D printed using soft elastomeric materials. These allow for both a deformable hinge and a rigid pattern. Thus, a skeleton made of a single material can be deformed to approximate the shape of the target-input surface by placing it in a membrane and removing the air. In this paper, we introduce related works and research contexts, challenges, inverse design simulator and its fabrication by 3D printing, and potential future applications.

Semantic gap in predicting mental wellbeing through passive sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502037,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502037,"
When modeling passive data to infer individual mental wellbeing, a common source of ground truth is self-reports. But these tend to represent the psychological facet of mental states, which might not align with the physiological facet of that state. Our paper demonstrates that when what people “feel” differs from what people “say they feel”, we witness a semantic gap that limits predictions. We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (offline sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psycho-social signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.

Affective state prediction from smartphone touch and sensor data in the wild,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501835,9,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/534814/Affective_State_Prediction_from_Smartphone_Touch_and_Sensor_Data_in_the_Wild.pdf,"
Knowledge of users’ affective states can improve their interaction with smartphones by providing more personalized experiences (e.g., search results and news articles). We present an affective state classification model based on data gathered on smartphones in real-world environments. From touch events during keystrokes and the signals from the inertial sensors, we extracted two-dimensional heat maps as input into a convolutional neural network to predict the affective states of smartphone users. For evaluation, we conducted a data collection in the wild with 82 participants over 10 weeks. Our model accurately predicts three levels (low, medium, high) of valence (AUC up to 0.83), arousal (AUC up to 0.85), and dominance (AUC up to 0.84). We also show that using the inertial sensor data alone, our model achieves a similar performance (AUC up to 0.83), making our approach less privacy-invasive. By personalizing our model to the user, we show that performance increases by an additional 0.07 AUC.

Understanding Gesture Input Articulation with Upper-Body Wearables for Users with Upper-Body Motor Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501964,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radu-Daniel-Vatavu/publication/360268016_Understanding_Gesture_Input_Articulation_with_Upper-Body_Wearables_for_Users_with_Upper-Body_Motor_Impairments/links/644d1445809a53502139df04/Understanding-Gesture-Input-Articulation-with-Upper-Body-Wearables-for-Users-with-Upper-Body-Motor-Impairments.pdf,"
 We examine touchscreen stroke-gestures and mid-air motion-gestures articulated by users with upper-body motor impairments with devices worn on the wrist, finger, and head. We analyze users’ gesture input performance in terms of production time, articulation consistency, and kinematic measures, and contrast the performance of users with upper-body motor impairments with that of a control group of users without impairments. Our results, from two datasets of 7,290 stroke-gestures and 3,809 motion-gestures collected from 28 participants, reveal that users with upper-body motor impairments take twice as much time to produce stroke-gestures on wearable touchscreens compared to users without impairments, but articulate motion-gestures equally fast and with similar acceleration. We interpret our findings in the context of ability-based design and propose ten implications for accessible gesture input with upper-body wearables for users with upper-body motor impairments.

TunePad playbooks: Designing computational Notebooks for creative music coding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502021,10,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10343044,"
This paper describes the design of an online learning platform that empowers musical creation and performance with Python code. For this platform we have developed an innovative computational notebook paradigm that we call TunePad playbooks. While playbooks borrow ideas from popular computational notebooks like Jupyter, we have designed them from the ground up to support creative musical expression including live performances. After discussing our design principles and features, we share findings from a series of artifact-centered interviews conducted with experienced TunePad users. Our results show how systems like ours might flexibly support a variety of creative workflows, while suggesting opportunities for future work in this area.

Critical-playful speculations with cameras in the home,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502109,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502109,"
Smart home cameras present new challenges for understanding behaviors and relationships surrounding always-on, domestic recording systems. We designed a series of discursive activities involving 16 individuals from ten households for six weeks in their everyday settings. These activities functioned as speculative probes—prompting participants to reflect on themes of privacy and power through filming with cameras in their households. Our research design foregrounded critical-playful enactments that allowed participants to speculate potentials for relationships with cameras in the home beyond everyday use. We present four key dynamics with participants and home cameras by examining their relationships to: the camera's eye, filming, their data, and camera's societal contexts. We contribute discussions about the mundane, information privacy, and post-hoc reflection with one's camera footage. Overall, our findings reveal the camera as a strange, yet banal entity in the home—interrogating how participants compose and handle their own and others’ video data.

"Much realistic, such wow! a systematic literature review of realism in digital games",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501875,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501875,"
Researchers reference realism in digital games without sufficient specificity. Without clarity about the dimensions of realism, we cannot assess how and when to aim for a higher degree of realism, when lower realism suffices, or when purposeful unrealism is ideal for a game and can benefit player experience (PX). To address this conceptual gap, we conducted a systematic review using thematic synthesis to distinguish between types of realism currently found in the digital games literature. We contribute qualitative themes that showcase contradictory design goals of realism/unrealism. From these themes, we created a framework (i.e., a hierarchical taxonomy and mapping) of realism dimensions in digital games as a conceptual foundation. Our themes and framework enable a workable specificity for designing or analyzing types of realism, equip future work to explore effects of specific realism types on PX, and offer a starting point for similar efforts in non-game applications.

Exploring gender-expansive categorization options for robots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519646,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519646,"
Gender is increasingly being explored as a social characteristic ascribed to robots by people. Yet, research involving social robots that may be gendered tends not to address gender perceptions, such as through pilot studies or manipulation checks. Moreover, research that does address gender perceptions has been limited by a reliance on the human gender binary model of feminine and masculine, prescriptive response options, and/or researcher assumptions and/or ascriptions of participant gendering. In response, we conducted an online pilot categorization study (n=55) wherein we provided gender-expansive response options for rating four robots ranging across four levels of anthropomorphism. Findings indicate that people gender robots in diverse ways, and not necessarily in relation to the gender binary. Additionally, less anthropomorphic robots and the childlike humanoid robot were deemed masculine, while the iconic robot was deemed gender neutral, fluid, and/or ambiguous. We discuss implications for future work on all humanoid robots.

 YouTube is a space where people with disabilities can reach a wider online audience to present what it is like to have disabilities. Thus, it is imperative to understand how content creators with disabilities strategically interact with algorithms to draw viewers around the world. However, considering that the algorithm carries the risk of making less inclusive decisions for users with disabilities, whether the current algorithmic experiences (AXs) on video platforms is inclusive for creators with disabilities is an open question. To address that, we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight YouTubers with disabilities. We found that they aimed to inform the public of diverse representations of disabilities, which led them to work with algorithms by strategically portraying disability identities. However, they were disappointed that the way the algorithms work did not sufficiently support their goals. Based on findings, we suggest implications for designing inclusive AXs that could embrace creators’ subtle needs.

Overcoming legacy bias: re-designing gesture interactions in virtual reality with a San community in Namibia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517549,10,https://scholar.archive.org/work/qbdf264k4vcp7m5gcwpqbzaed4/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517549,"
 Recent improvements in hand-tracking technologies support novel applications and developments of gesture interactions in virtual reality (VR). Current implementations are mostly convention-based, originating in a Western technological context, thereby creating a legacy bias in gesture interaction implementations. With expanding application contexts and growing user groups and contexts, the design and selection of gestures need to be diversified. In this paper we present an exploration of natural gestures, followed by their implementation in a VR application and co-design of new gestures with a marginalized San community in Namibia. This study contributes to the still scarce empirical work in user-driven gesture design research, aiming to reduce legacy bias, on a methodological and technical level as well as through engaging non-WEIRD participants. Our findings confirm the applicability of our method, combined with Partner and Priming suggested by Morris et al., to the design of gestures inspired by natural interactions. We also consider the implementation of user-designed gestures to be necessary to asses usability, usefulness and technical issues in VR. Furthermore, the research directly advances the HCI agenda for diversity, through an ongoing research and design partnership with an indigenous community in Southern Africa, thereby challenging systemic bias and promoting design for the pluriverse.

Interpretable Directed Diversity: Leveraging Model Explanations for Iterative Crowd Ideation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517551,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517551,"
 Feedback in creativity support tools can help crowdworkers to improve their ideations. However, current feedback methods require human assessment from facilitators or peers. This is not scalable to large crowds. We propose Interpretable Directed Diversity to automatically predict ideation quality and diversity scores, and provide AI explanations — Attribution, Contrastive Attribution, and Counterfactual Suggestions — to feedback on why ideations were scored (low), and how to get higher scores. These explanations provide multi-faceted feedback as users iteratively improve their ideations. We conducted formative and controlled user studies to understand the usage and usefulness of explanations to improve ideation diversity and quality. Users appreciated that explanation feedback helped focus their efforts and provided directions for improvement. This resulted in explanations improving diversity compared to no feedback or feedback with scores only. Hence, our approach opens opportunities for explainable AI towards scalable and rich feedback for iterative crowd ideation and creativity support tools.

 Computational design tools can automatically generate large quantities of viable designs for a given design problem. This raises the challenge of how to enable designers to efficiently and effectively evaluate and select preferred designs from a large set of alternatives. In GeneratiVR, we present two novel interaction techniques to address this challenge, by leveraging Virtual Reality for rich, spatial user input. With these interaction methods, users can directly manipulate designs or demonstrate desired design functionality. The interactions allow users to rapidly filter through an expansive design space to specify or find their preferred designs.

Avatar identities and climate change action in video games: analysis of mitigation and adaptation practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517438,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517438,"
 Games are considered promising for engaging people with climate change. In virtual worlds, players can adopt empowering roles to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and/or adapt to climate impacts. However, the lack of a comprehensive exploration of existing climate-related identities and actions prevents understanding their potential. Here, we analyze 80 video games and classify avatar identities, or expected player roles, into six types. Climate selves encourage direct life changes; climate citizens are easy to identify with and imitate; climate heroes are inspirational figures upholding environmental values; empowered individuals deliberate to avoid a tragedy of the commons; authorities should consider stakeholders and the environment; and faction leaders engage in bi- or multilateral relations. Adaptation is often for decision-making profiles, while empowered individuals, authorities, and faction leaders usually face conflicting objectives. We discuss our results in relation to avatar research and provide suggestions for researchers, designers, and educators.

Information extraction (IE) approaches often play a pivotal role in text analysis and require significant human intervention. Therefore, a deeper understanding of existing IE practices and related challenges from a human-in-the-loop perspective is warranted. In this work, we conducted semi-structured interviews in an industrial environment and analyzed the reported IE approaches and limitations. We observed that data science workers often follow an iterative task model consisting of information foraging and sensemaking loops across all the phases of an IE workflow. The task model is generalizable and captures diverse goals across these phases (e.g., data preparation, modeling, evaluation.) We found several limitations in both foraging (e.g., data exploration) and sensemaking (e.g., qualitative debugging) loops stemming from a lack of adherence to existing cognitive engineering principles. Moreover, we identified that due to the iterative nature of an IE workflow, the requirement of provenance is often implied but rarely supported by existing systems. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting IE workflows and future research directions.

 Virtual reality (VR) has increasingly been used in many areas, and the need to deliver notifications in VR is also expected to increase accordingly. However, untimely interruptions could largely impact the experience in VR. Identifying opportune times to deliver notifications to users allows for notifications to be scheduled in a way that minimizes disruption. We conducted a study to investigate the use of sensor data available on an off-the-shelf VR device and additional contextual information, including current activity and engagement of users, to predict opportune moments for sending notifications using deep learning models. Our analysis shows that using mainly sensor features could achieve 72% recall, 71% precision and 0.86 area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC); performance can be further improved to 81% recall, 82% precision, and 0.93 AUROC if information about activity and summarized user engagement is included.

Constructing olfactory interfaces on demand requires significant design proficiency and engineering effort. The absence of powerful and convenient tools that reduced innovation complexity posed obstacles for future research in the area. To address this problem, we proposed O&O, a modular olfactory interface DIY toolkit. The toolkit consists of: (1) a scent generation kit, a set of electronics and accessories that supported three common scent vaporization techniques; (2) a module construction kit, a set of primitive cardboard modules for assembling permutable functional structures; (3) a design manual, a step-by-step design thinking framework that directs the decision-making and prototyping process. We organized a formal workshop with 19 participants and four solo DIY trials to evaluate the capability of the toolkit, the overall user engagement, the creations in both sessions, and the iterative suggestions. Finally, design implications and future opportunities were discussed for further research.

 We demonstrate that recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques introduce a new paradigm of vocabulary learning that benefits from both micro and usage-based learning by generating and presenting the usages of foreign words based on the learner’s context. Then, without allocating dedicated time for studying, the user can become familiarized with how the words are used by seeing the example usages during daily activities, such as Web browsing. To achieve this, we introduce VocabEncounter, a vocabulary-learning system that suitably encapsulates the given words into materials the user is reading in near real time by leveraging recent NLP techniques. After confirming the system’s human-comparable quality of generating translated phrases by involving crowdworkers, we conducted a series of user studies, which demonstrated its effectiveness on learning vocabulary and its favorable experiences. Our work shows how NLP-based generation techniques can transform our daily activities into a field for vocabulary learning.

We present a performance-led inquiry that involved a live coder programming movement-based interactive sound and two dance improvisers. During two years of collaboration, we developed a joint improvisation practice where the interactions between the dancers’ movement and the sound feedback are programmed on the fly through live coding and movement sensing. To that end, we designed a new live coding environment called CO/DA that facilitates the real-time manipulation of continuous streams of the dancers’ motion data for interactive sound synthesis. Through an autoethnographic inquiry, we describe our practice of sound and movement improvisation where live coding dynamically changes how the dancers’ movements generate sound, which in turn influences the dancers’ improvisation. We then discuss the value, potential and challenges of our dance/code improvisation practice, along with its implications as a design method.

Analysis of human motion data can reveal valuable insights about the utilization of space and interaction of humans with their environment. To support this, we present AvatAR, an immersive analysis environment for the in-situ visualization of human motion data, that combines 3D trajectories with virtual avatars showing people’s detailed movement and posture. Additionally, we describe how visualizations can be embedded directly into the environment, showing what a person looked at or what surfaces they touched, and how the avatar’s body parts can be used to access and manipulate those visualizations. AvatAR combines an AR HMD with a tablet to provide both mid-air and touch interaction for system control, as well as an additional overview device to help users navigate the environment. We implemented a prototype and present several scenarios to show that AvatAR can enhance the analysis of human motion data by making data not only explorable, but experienceable.

China has witnessed rapid growth in its e-commerce markets and livestreaming communities in recent years. The commercialization of livestreaming has led to the rise of e-commerce livestreamers, among which rural women constitute a substantial portion. To understand the motivations underlying these women's choices to engage in livestreaming activities and probe the extent to which they are empowered by this new form of entrepreneurship, we conducted an interview-based study with rural female livestreamers. We found that these women chose to be livestreamers for practical and self-presentation purposes and they gained a sense of self-empowerment through economic, social, intellectual, psychological, and spiritual dimensions. At the same time, however, they experienced and confronted social stigmas rooted in rural societies and the strategies they used to deal with these biases were vastly different. Our work contributes to the HCI community by providing a nuanced understanding of the motives and lived experiences of rural female livestreamers and offers design implications that could improve the everyday experiences of these livestreamers.

Data visualizations are now widely used across many disciplines. However, many of them are not easily accessible for visually impaired people. In this work, we use three-staged mixed methods to understand the current practice of accessible visualization design for visually impaired people. We analyzed 95 visualizations from various venues to inspect how they are made inaccessible. To understand the rationale and context behind the design choices, we also conducted surveys with 144 practitioners in the U.S. and follow-up interviews with ten selected survey participants. Our findings include the difficulties of handling modern complex and interactive visualizations and the lack of accessibility support from visualization tools in addition to personal and organizational factors making it challenging to perform accessible design practices.

Prediction for retrospection: Integrating algorithmic stress prediction into personal informatics systems for college students' mental health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517701,8,https://astlyi.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/%5B85%5D+CHI22_Prediction_for_Restrospection.pdf,"
Reflecting on stress-related data is critical in addressing one’s mental health. Personal Informatics (PI) systems augmented by algorithms and sensors have become popular ways to help users collect and reflect on data about stress. While prediction algorithms in the PI systems are mainly for diagnostic purposes, few studies examine how the explainability of algorithmic prediction can support user-driven self-insight. To this end, we developed MindScope, an algorithm-assisted stress management system that determines user stress levels and explains how the stress level was computed based on the user’s everyday activities captured by a smartphone. In a 25-day field study conducted with 36 college students, the prediction and explanation supported self-reflection, a process to re-establish preconceptions about stress by identifying stress patterns and recalling past stress levels and patterns that led to coping planning. We discuss the implications of exploiting prediction algorithms that facilitate user-driven retrospection in PI systems.

eHealth coaching is a promising approach for delivering effective, person-centered, digital health interventions. Yet, the way eHealth coaches ‘tailor’ interventions using technology is currently unclear. This study aims to understand how eHealth coaches tailor support to clients seeking to lose weight. Nine in-depth interviews with eHealth coaches were conducted. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis, deriving three themes: ‘Understanding the client,’ ‘Adapting Support,’ and ‘Navigating challenges.’ Coaches used both assessment tools and their growing relationship to understand client's needs. Coaches adapted the pace and nature of educational content, utilized their clients' preferred technologies, and adopted different personas to meet the needs of each individual. Providing tailored support also presented challenges for eHealth coaches, with technology eroding personal and professional boundaries. Our work interrogates what it means to ‘tailor’ support, through exploring coaching as a humanistic approach to behaviour change, with implications for the design of person-centered digital coaching interventions/systems.

 The layout of a mobile screen is a critical data source for UI design research and semantic understanding of the screen. However, UI layouts in existing datasets are often noisy, have mismatches with their visual representation, or consists of generic or app-specific types that are difficult to analyze and model. In this paper, we propose the CLAY pipeline that uses a deep learning approach for denoising UI layouts, allowing us to automatically improve existing mobile UI layout datasets at scale. Our pipeline takes both the screenshot and the raw UI layout, and annotates the raw layout by removing incorrect nodes and assigning a semantically meaningful type to each node. To experiment with our data-cleaning pipeline, we create the CLAY dataset of 59,555 human-annotated screen layouts, based on screenshots and raw layouts from Rico, a public mobile UI corpus. Our deep models achieve high accuracy with F1 scores of 82.7% for detecting layout objects that do not have a valid visual representation and 85.9% for recognizing object types, which significantly outperforms a heuristic baseline. Our work lays a foundation for creating large-scale high quality UI layout datasets for data-driven mobile UI research and reduces the need of manual labeling efforts that are prohibitively expensive.

From 'wow'to 'why': Guidelines for creating the opening of a data video with cinematic styles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501896,8,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02709,"
 Data videos are an increasingly popular storytelling form. The opening of a data video critically influences its success as the opening either attracts the audience to continue watching or bores them to abandon watching. However, little is known about how to create an attractive opening. We draw inspiration from the openings of famous films to facilitate designing data video openings. First, by analyzing over 200 films from several sources, we derived six primary cinematic opening styles adaptable to data videos. Then, we consulted eight experts from the film industry to formulate 28 guidelines. To validate the usability and effectiveness of the guidelines, we asked participants to create data video openings with and without the guidelines, which were then evaluated by experts and the general public. Results showed that the openings designed with the guidelines were perceived to be more attractive, and the guidelines were praised for clarity and inspiration.

Faceori: Tracking head position and orientation using ultrasonic ranging on earphones,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517698,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517698,"
 Face orientation can often indicate users’ intended interaction target. In this paper, we propose FaceOri, a novel face tracking technique based on acoustic ranging using earphones. FaceOri can leverage the speaker on a commodity device to emit an ultrasonic chirp, which is picked up by the set of microphones on the user’s earphone, and then processed to calculate the distance from each microphone to the device. These measurements are used to derive the user’s face orientation and distance with respect to the device. We conduct a ground truth comparison and user study to evaluate FaceOri’s performance. The results show that the system can determine whether the user orients to the device at a 93.5% accuracy within a 1.5 meters range. Furthermore, FaceOri can continuously track user’s head orientation with a median absolute error of 10.9 mm in the distance, 3.7° in yaw, and 5.8° in pitch. FaceOri can allow for convenient hands-free control of devices and produce more intelligent context-aware interactions.

Designing for everyday sounds at home with people with dementia and their partners,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501993,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501993,"
People with dementia and their caregivers aging in place have expressed the need for social, emotional, and recreational interventions at home. Listening to everyday sounds evokes memories and provides conversational cues to support social relations and elicit emotional responses for people with dementia. However, research has yet to explore how these meaningful experiences can be transferred into home settings. This paper presents the insights from our co-design study that involved three people with dementia and their partners in developing an interactive sound player for listening to everyday sounds at home. We report on the motivations of people with dementia and their caregivers to engage in meaningful sound-based activities at home and present the Tumbler as a prototype to foster initiative and agency in exploring familiar everyday sounds. We present design implications of how sound can enrich the everyday experiences of dementia by facilitating social and pleasurable moments at home.

Demonstration of VRBubble: Enhancing Peripheral Avatar Awareness for People with Visual Impairments in Social Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519657,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/57garfyh2vdyhmu4uzg6zy46uu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519657,"
 Social Virtual Reality (VR) use is growing for socializing and collaboration. However, current applications are not accessible to people with visual impairments (PVI) due to their focus on visual experiences. We aim to design VR technologies to enhance social VR accessibility for PVI. We focus on facilitating peripheral awareness, a vital ability in social activities. With an iterative design process involving five participants, we designed VRBubble, a VR technique to facilitate peripheral awareness for PVI via spatial audio. Based on Hall’s proxemic theory, VRBubble divides the social space with three Bubbles—Intimate, Personal, and Social Bubble—generating spatial audio feedback to distinguish avatars in different bubbles and provide suitable avatar information. We provide three audio alternatives: earcons, verbal notifications, and sound effects. PVI can select and combine their preferred feedback alternatives for different social context to maintain avatar awareness in a dynamic social VR environment.

Bridging Contextual and Methodological Gaps on the “Misinformation Beat”: Insights from Journalist-Researcher Collaborations at Speed,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517503,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517503,"
As misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories increase online, so does journalism coverage of these topics. This reporting is challenging, and journalists fill gaps in their expertise by utilizing external resources, including academic researchers. This paper discusses how journalists work with researchers to report on online misinformation. Through an ethnographic study of thirty collaborations, including participant-observation and interviews with journalists and researchers, we identify five types of collaborations and describe what motivates journalists to reach out to researchers — from a lack of access to data to support for understanding misinformation context. We highlight challenges within these collaborations, including misalignment in professional work practices, ethical guidelines, and reward structures. We end with a call to action for CHI researchers to attend to this intersection, develop ethical guidelines around supporting journalists with data at speed, and offer practical approaches for researchers filling a “data mediator” role between social media and journalists.

The Future of Work is No Work: A Call to Action for Designers in the Abolition of Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516385,2,,"
We endure decades of preparation for, enduring of, and recovery from work. It manifests and corrupts most of our life. It doesn't have to be like this. We can envision and design towards a future that gives life back to us: a world without work as we know it. HCI as a field should be oriented towards abolishing work for everyone rather than designing a future of work, often depicted as a metaverse of three-dimensional avatars, virtual workplaces, and automated oppression. In this paper, we detail what work is, what the abolition of work means, and a call to action for HCI to abolish work following a transformative justice framework.

Recentering Reframing as an RtD Contribution: The Case of Pivoting from Accessible Web Tables to a Conversational Internet,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517789,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517789,"
Design produces valuable knowledge by offering new perspectives that reframe problematic situations. Research through Design (RtD) contributes new frames along with design work demonstrating a frame's value. Interestingly, RtD papers rarely describe how reframing happens. This gap in documentation unintentionally implies a romantic account of design, it implies that the first step of an RtD project is to have a brilliant idea. This is especially problematic in cases where the reframing causes a pivot that leads to a new research program. To help address this gap, we describe a case where through a series of three design experiments we experienced a research pivot. We describe how our work to improve web-table navigation for screen-reader users broke our frame. The break led to a new research program focused on constructing a conversational internet. This paper offers our case along with reflection on reporting design work that drives reframing.

"Watch It, Don't Imagine It: Creating a Better Caption-Occlusion Metric by Collecting More Ecologically Valid Judgments from DHH Viewers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517681,6,https://scholar.archive.org/work/z5xjdtguw5hnpjn27ctnhb5rrq/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517681,"
 Television captions blocking visual information causes dissatisfaction among Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) viewers, yet existing caption evaluation metrics do not consider occlusion. To create such a metric, DHH participants in a recent study imagined how bad it would be if captions blocked various on-screen text or visual content. To gather more ecologically valid data for creating an improved metric, we asked 24 DHH participants to give subjective judgments of caption quality after actually watching videos, and a regression analysis revealed which on-screen contents’ occlusion related to users’ judgments. For several video genres, a metric based on our new dataset out-performed the prior state-of-the-art metric for predicting the severity of captions occluding content during videos, which had been based on that prior study. We contribute empirical findings for improving DHH viewers’ experience, guiding the placement of captions to minimize occlusions, and automated evaluation of captioning quality in television broadcasts.

Examining identity as a variable of health technology research for older adults: a systematic review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517621,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517621,"
 Innovations in HCI research of health-related pervasive and ubiquitous technologies can potentially improve older adults’ access to healthcare resources and support long-term independence in the home. Despite efforts to include their voices in technology research and design, many older adults have yet to actualize these health benefits, with barriers of access and proficiency actually widening the gap of health inequities. We reviewed 174 HCI publications through a systematic review to examine who is engaged in the design of health technologies for older adults, methods used to engage them, and how different types of participation might impact design directions. Findings highlight that thus far, many identity dimensions have not been explored in HCI aging research. We identify research gaps and implications to promote expanding research engagement with these dimensions as a way to support the design of health technologies that see better adoption among marginalized populations.

ImpactVest: Rendering Spatio-Temporal Multilevel Impact Force Feedback on Body in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501971,8,,"
 Rendering instant and intense impact feedback on users’ hands, limbs and head to enhance realism in virtual reality (VR) has been proposed in previous works, but impact on the body is still less discussed. With the body’s large surface area to utilize, numerous impact patterns can be rendered in versatile VR applications, e.g., being shot, blasted, punched or slashed on body in VR games. Herein we propose ImpactVest to render spatio-temporal multilevel impact force feedback on body. By independently controlling nine impactors in a 3 × 3 layout using elastic force, impact is generated at different levels, positions and time sequences for versatile spatial and temporal combinations. We conducted a just-noticeable difference (JND) study to understand users’ impact level distinguishability on the body. A time interval threshold study was then performed to ascertain what time interval thresholds between two impact stimuli should be used to distinguish from simultaneous impact, a continuous impact stroke and two discrete impact stimuli. Based on the results, we conducted a VR experience study to verify that impact feedback from ImpactVest enhances VR realism.

'It Is Not Always Discovery Time': Four Pragmatic Approaches in Designing AI Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501943,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501943,"
 While systems that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly becoming part of everyday technology use, we do not fully understand how AI changes design processes. A structured understanding of how designers work with AI is needed to improve the design process and educate future designers. To that end, we conducted interviews with designers who participated in projects which used AI. While past work focused on AI systems created by experienced designers, we focus on the perspectives of a diverse sample of interaction designers. Our results show that the design process of an interactive system is affected when AI is integrated and that design teams adapt their processes to accommodate AI. Based on our data, we contribute four approaches adopted by interaction designers working with AI: a priori, post-hoc, model-centric, and competence-centric. Our work contributes a pragmatic account of how design processes for AI systems are enacted.

Share Your Values! Community-Driven Embedding of Ethics in Research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516389,2,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SOxgOe6OIva7UlVs0t8NpN7j0EYG_9j4/view,"
 Ethically-defensible research requires wide-ranging, holistic, and deep consideration. It is often overseen by Research Ethics Committees, Institutional Research Boards or equivalents but not all organisations have these and where they do, their degree of independence from organisational priorities varies (perhaps leading to research that would create reputational or other difficulties for organisations being left unpublished or unacknowledged). Conflicts of interest can therefore be left unmanaged, participants may be exploited, and society may not benefit. In this paper, we claim that publishing communities (e.g. scholarly conferences) can play a larger role in supporting improved ethical practice by defining and communicating the ethical values of their community’s collective identity and aspirations. This approach is not prescriptive like procedural ethics nor as broad as general research ethics codes (both are important) but offers a tangible way to unify ethics concerns across research contexts.

LivingMoments: Bespoke social communication for people living with dementia and their relatives,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517430,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517430,"
Dementia can hinder a person's ability to engage with their relatives. Existing communication technologies do not support people with dementia in maintaining social contact since they are not designed for their abilities and needs. This paper presents LivingMoments, a communication system that enables the engagement of people with dementia with their relatives. The system uses digital and physical interaction design considering people's different and changing abilities. Over a six-week field evaluation of LivingMoments, involving six participants living at home with different levels of dementia, we collected qualitative and quantitative data about the experiences of them and their relatives. Based on the data analysis, we found the need to adapt communication to individual abilities, lowering barriers through content calibration and establishing habits for continuous use. We evinced a set of design considerations for technologies to support a lasting engagement of people with dementia with different and changing abilities.

Despite efforts to augment or replace the 2-dimensional spreadsheet grid with formal data structures such as arrays and tables to ease formula authoring and reduce errors, the flexible grid remains overwhelmingly successful. Why? We interviewed a diverse sample of 21 spreadsheet users about their use of structure in spreadsheets. It emerges that data structuring is subject to a complex network of incentives and constraints, including factors extrinsic to spreadsheets such as the user’s expertise, auxiliary tools, and collaborator needs. Moreover, we find that table columns are an important abstraction, and that operations such as conditional formatting, data validation, and formula authoring can be implemented on table columns, rather than cell ranges. To probe this, we designed 4 click-through prototypes for a follow-up study with 20 participants. We found that although column operations improved the value proposition of structured tables, they are unlikely to supplant the advantages of the flexible grid.

Digital proxemics: Designing social and collaborative interaction in virtual environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517594,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517594,"
 Behaviour in virtual environments might be informed by our experiences in physical environments, but virtual environments are not constrained by the same physical, perceptual, or social cues. Instead of replicating the properties of physical spaces, one can create virtual experiences that diverge from reality by dynamically manipulating environmental, aural, and social properties. This paper explores digital proxemics, which describe how we use space in virtual environments and how the presence of others influences our behaviours, interactions, and movements. First, we frame the open challenges of digital proxemics in terms of activity, social signals, audio design, and environment. We explore a subset of these challenges through an evaluation that compares two audio designs and two displays with different social signal affordances: head-mounted display (HMD) versus desktop PC. We use quantitative methods using instrumented tracking to analyse behaviour, demonstrating how personal space, proximity, and attention compare between desktop PC and HMDs.

 Collaborative writing is an integral part of academic and professional work. Although some prior research has focused on accessibility in collaborative writing, we know little about how visually impaired writers work in real-time with sighted collaborators or how online editing tools could better support their work. Grounded in formative interviews and observations with eight screen reader users, we built Co11ab, a Google Docs extension that provides configurable audio cues to facilitate understanding who is editing (or edited) what and where in a shared document. Results from a design exploration with fifteen screen reader users, including three naturalistic sessions of use with sighted colleagues, reveal how screen reader users understand various auditory representations and use them to coordinate real-time collaborative writing. We revisit what collaboration awareness means for screen reader users and discuss design considerations for future systems.

 We present results of a survey (n=42) investigating how close others (family members, friends, or other community members) assist older adults with banking tasks in Canada. We asked what types of banking tasks they help with and what modalities they used. Our results show many close others help older adults by leveraging online banking, and this is especially true when the close other is an older adult themselves. We also found that close others who help older adults via online banking often know the online banking credentials for the older adults they assist, which presents privacy and security issues and could open the door to financial exploitation. Our results demonstrate the need for the design of online banking mechanisms that more explicitly acknowledge the nuanced and temporally changing role of close others in helping older adults with banking.

ImageExplorer: Multi-Layered Touch Exploration to Encourage Skepticism Towards Imperfect AI-Generated Image Captions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501966,7,,"
 Blind users rely on alternative text (alt-text) to understand an image; however, alt-text is often missing. AI-generated captions are a more scalable alternative, but they often miss crucial details or are completely incorrect, which users may still falsely trust. In this work, we sought to determine how additional information could help users better judge the correctness of AI-generated captions. We developed ImageExplorer, a touch-based multi-layered image exploration system that allows users to explore the spatial layout and information hierarchies of images, and compared it with popular text-based (Facebook) and touch-based (Seeing AI) image exploration systems in a study with 12 blind participants. We found that exploration was generally successful in encouraging skepticism towards imperfect captions. Moreover, many participants preferred ImageExplorer for its multi-layered and spatial information presentation, and Facebook for its summary and ease of use. Finally, we identify design improvements for effective and explainable image exploration systems for blind users.

Unpacking intention and behavior: explaining contact tracing app adoption and hesitancy in the United States,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501963,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501963,"
 COVID-19 has demonstrated the importance of digital contact tracing apps in reducing the spread of disease. Despite people widely expressing interest in using contact tracing apps, actual installation rates have been low in many parts of the world. Prior studies suggest that decisions to use these apps are largely shaped by pandemic beliefs, social influences, perceived benefits and harms, and other factors. However, there is a gap in understanding what factors motivate intention, but not subsequent behavior of actual adoption. Reporting on a survey of 290 U.S. residents, we disentangle the intention-behavior gap by investigating factors associated with installing a contact tracing app from those associated with intending to install, but not actually installing. Our results suggest that social norms can be leveraged to span the intention-behavior gap, and that a privacy paradox may influence people’s adoption decisions. We present recommendations for technologies that enlist individuals to address collective challenges.

Computableviz: Mathematical operators as a formalism for visualisation processing and analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517618,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00856,"
 Data visualizations are created and shared on the web at an unprecedented speed, raising new needs and questions for processing and analyzing visualizations after they have been generated and digitized. However, existing formalisms focus on operating on a single visualization instead of multiple visualizations, making it challenging to perform analysis tasks such as sorting and clustering visualizations. Through a systematic analysis of previous work, we abstract visualization-related tasks into mathematical operators such as union and propose a design space of visualization operations. We realize the design by developing ComputableViz, a library that supports operations on multiple visualization specifications. To demonstrate its usefulness and extensibility, we present multiple usage scenarios concerning processing and analyzing visualization, such as generating visualization embeddings and automatically making visualizations accessible. We conclude by discussing research opportunities and challenges for managing and exploiting the massive visualizations on the web.

What could possibly go wrong when interacting with proactive smart speakers? a case study using an esm application,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517432,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johanne-Trippas/publication/360331139_What_Could_Possibly_Go_Wrong_When_Interacting_with_Proactive_Smart_Speakers_A_Case_Study_Using_an_ESM_Application/links/6315815661e4553b9567e59d/What-Could-Possibly-Go-Wrong-When-Interacting-with-Proactive-Smart-Speakers-A-Case-Study-Using-an-ESM-Application.pdf,"
 Voice user interfaces (VUIs) have made their way into people’s daily lives, from voice assistants to smart speakers. Although VUIs typically just react to direct user commands, increasingly, they incorporate elements of proactive behaviors. In particular, proactive smart speakers have the potential for many applications, ranging from healthcare to entertainment; however, their usability in everyday life is subject to interaction errors. To systematically investigate the nature of errors, we designed a voice-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) application to run on proactive speakers. We captured 1,213 user interactions in a 3-week field deployment in 13 participants’ homes. Through auxiliary audio recordings and logs, we identify substantial interaction errors and strategies that users apply to overcome those errors. We further analyze the interaction timings and provide insights into the time cost of errors. We find that, even for answering simple ESMs, interaction errors occur frequently and can hamper the usability of proactive speakers and user experience. Our work also identifies multiple facets of VUIs that can be improved in terms of the timing of speech.

"How to guide task-oriented chatbot users, and when: A mixed-methods study of combinations of chatbot guidance types and timings",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501941,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501941,"
 The popularity of task-oriented chatbots is constantly growing, but smooth conversational progress with them remains profoundly challenging. In recent years, researchers have argued that chatbot systems should include guidance for users on how to converse with them. Nevertheless, empirical evidence about what to place in such guidance, and when to deliver it, has been lacking. Using a mixed-methods approach that integrates results from a between-subjects experiment and a reflection session, this paper compares the effectiveness of eight combinations of two guidance types (example-based and rule-based) at four guidance timings (service-onboarding, task-intro, after-failure, and upon-request), as measured by users’ task performance, improvement on subsequent tasks, and subjective experience. It establishes that each guidance type and timing has particular strengths and weaknesses, thus that each type/timing combination has a unique impact on performance metrics, learning outcomes, and user experience. On that basis, it presents guidance-design recommendations for future task-oriented chatbots.

 Play is an essential part of the human experience and can be found throughout the lifespan. While play has long been of interest to the HCI community, research has often focused on the technologies supporting game play, the potential outcomes of play (e.g., skill-building, health improvements), or play among children. This paper explores what play looks like in online communities that are not specifically game-based and consist primarily of adults. From online ethnographic work of the ARMY (i.e., Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), fandom of the South Korean musical group BTS, we explore how BTS and ARMY collaboratively construct a playful social environment using various social media platforms. A contribution of this work is to expand our conceptualization of how adults create playful places that are not specifically game-based and highlights the role of socio-technical systems in their community building.

Given the ongoing environmental crisis and recent calls within HCI to engage with its cascading effects on the more-than-human world, this paper introduces the concept of the eco-technical interface as a critical zone at which designers can surface and subvert issues of multispecies relations such as nonhuman instrumentalization. The eco-technical interface represents the sites at which human, nonhuman, and technological interfaces overlap, ranging from remote sensing for conservation to smart devices for precision agriculture to community science platforms for species identification. Here, we highlight the pervasiveness of the eco-technical interface as a set of sites for further HCI inquiry, engage with the politics and instrumentalizing tendencies at three particular sites, and demonstrate tactics for cultivating attunement to, reflexively accounting for, and subverting instrumentalization in multispecies encounter.

Avatar interpreter: improving classroom experiences for deaf and hard-of-hearing people based on augmented reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519799,5,https://scholar.archive.org/work/x3ikioe5mbdwpbhhl7do5zz2vq/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519799,"
 Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people experience difficulties in accessing education. One reason is that they miss out on oral information in the classroom. Although some classrooms are equipped with sign language interpreters specifically for deaf students, DHH students have trouble switching their gaze and attention when they cannot see the interpreter and the visual information in the classroom simultaneously. To address this challenge, this paper develops Avatar Interpreter, a visual interface for synchronized sign language interpreters on an augmented reality head-mounted display. Avatar Interpreter can be displayed at different sizes and in different locations in space to fit different scenarios, helping deaf students to better receive sign language information and enhancing the classroom experience for deaf students. In the work presented in this paper, we discuss our prototype, make design recommendations, and discuss configuration and implementation. Finally, we propose questions and research methods for an upcoming user study.

 Teleportation has become the de facto standard of locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. However, teleportation with parabolic and linear target aiming methods is restricted to horizontal 2D planes and it is unknown how they transfer to the 3D space. In this paper, we propose six 3D teleportation methods in virtual environments based on the combination of two existing aiming methods (linear and parabolic) and three types of transitioning to a target (instant, interpolated and continuous). To investigate the performance of the proposed teleportation methods, we conducted a controlled lab experiment (N = 24) with a mid-air coin collection task to assess accuracy, efficiency and VR sickness. We discovered that the linear aiming method leads to faster and more accurate target selection. Moreover, a combination of linear aiming and instant transitioning leads to the highest efficiency and accuracy without increasing VR sickness.

The Scent of Collaboration: Exploring the Effect of Smell on Social Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519632,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519632,"
 Social interactions are multisensory experiences. However, it is not well understood how technology-mediated smell can support social interactions, especially in collaborative tasks. To explore its effect on collaboration, we asked eleven pairs of users to work together on a writing task while wearing an interactive jewellery designed to emit scent in a controlled fashion. In a within-subjects experiment, participants were asked to collaboratively write a story about a standardized visual stimulus while exposed to with scent and without scent conditions. We analyzed video recordings and written stories using a combination of methods from HCI, psychology, sociology, and human communication research. We observed differences in both participants’ communication and creation of insightful stories in the with scent condition. Furthermore, scent helped participants recover from communication breakdown even though they were unaware of it. We discuss the possible implications of our findings and the potential of technology-mediated scent for collaborative activities.

“Time spent on platform” is a widely used measure in many studies examining social media use and well-being, yet the current literature presents unresolved findings about the relationship between time on platform and well-being. In this paper, we consider the moderating effect of people’s mindsets about social media — whether they think a platform is good or bad for themselves and for society more generally. Combining survey responses from 29,284 participants in 15 countries with server-logged data of Facebook use, we found that when people thought that Facebook was good for them and for society, time spent on the platform was not significantly associated with well-being. Conversely, when they thought Facebook was bad, greater time spent was associated with lower well-being. On average, there was a small, negative correlation between time spent and well-being and the causal direction is not known. Beliefs had a stronger moderating relationship when time-spent measures were self-reported rather than coming from server logs. We discuss potential mechanisms for these results and implications for future research on well-being and social media use.

Towards Enhancing Empathy Through Emotion Augmented Remote Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519797,2,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146091/3491101.3519797.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
Our ability to empathize stands at the core of our existence as humans. It has dramatically contributed to our evolution as species and remains key to our relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. Yet, we sometimes find it difficult to empathize, more so in the online space increasingly dominating our interactions.  In this work, we explore the potential of videoconferencing platforms as avenues for augmenting empathy. We have developed Project Us, a system that uses machine learning to analyze interlocutors’ tone of voice and facial expressions during online interactions, compiles their emotional valence and feeds it back to each participant as a real-time visual cue. Tested with 40 users, Project Us shows the emergence of empathy-related behaviours, such as a higher awareness of own and other’s emotions, and an increased use of pro-social language, as evaluated through quantitative (natural language processing) and qualitative methods. We also analyze ethical challenges of empathy augmentation.

” It Matches My Worldview”: Examining Perceptions and Attitudes Around Fake Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517646,7,https://www.ictworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/deepfakes-cheapfakes-perception-india.pdf,"
We present a qualitative study with 36 diverse social media users in India to critically examine how low-resource communities engage with fake videos, including cheapfakes and AI-generated deepfakes. We find that most users are unaware of digitally manipulated fake videos and perceive videos to be fake only when they present inaccurate information. Few users who know about doctored videos expect them to be of poor quality and know nothing about sophisticated deepfakes. Moreover, most users lack the skills and willingness to spot fake videos and some were oblivious to the risks and harms of fake videos. Even when users know a video to be fake, they prefer to take no action and sometimes willingly share fake videos that favor their worldview. Drawing on our findings, we discuss design recommendations for social media platforms to curb the spread of fake videos.

"Exploring uncertainty in digital scheduling, and the wider implications of unrepresented temporalities in HCI",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502107,8,https://vishub.net/papers/Bowler2022uncertainty.pdf,"
 Digital calendars and other technologies for social event planning leave little space to communicate uncertainty regarding time, place or the ability to attend an event. However, narratives of certainty can be detrimental and lead to the marginalisation of those who find it hard to cope with rigid and strictly paced schedules, such as people with health conditions or caring responsibilities. In this paper, we explore uncertainty as the starting point and leading principle behind digital scheduling tools. We present Haze, a speculative tool and user interface, designed to gain insights on participants’ perceptions of uncertainty-based scheduling scenarios. We report on two qualitative studies (total of 21 participants), which indicate that a change in perspective towards uncertainty can challenge moral assumptions around certainty, increase temporal empathy, and indeed support those who are particularly affected by uncertainty. These findings help shift and expand the repertoire of temporality and discuss moral and social responsibilities for design and HCI.

Community Resilience: Quantifying the Disruptive Effects of Sudden Spikes in Activity within Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519813,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/jnx3a4itanhfdfcffcg62xh4ra/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519813,"
 Online communities often experience some form of crisis. Regardless of whether these communities are small groups or entire platforms, the ability to handle disruptions during volatile periods signifies the resilience of a community. In this paper, we analyze the effects of a specific type of crisis event on Reddit: sudden spikes in attention received by a community due to a post from the subreddit hitting r/popular—the default feed that aggregates the most popular content on Reddit. Our results show that r/popular is a source of potential disruptions due to the higher number of comments, authors, and especially removed comments found compared to threads that do not reach r/popular. When looking at r/popular’s effects across subreddits, large communities’ commenting and posting behaviors were less impacted by r/popular threads compared to smaller communities. However, similar-sized subreddits had substantial variations in how their commenting and posting activities were influenced by an r/popular thread. Understanding the causal factors behind these differences has implications for online governance, as well as fostering resilient and healthy communities.

ZenVR: Design Evaluation of a Virtual Reality Learning System for Meditation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502035,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502035,"
 Meditation has become a popular option to manage stress. Though studies examine technologies to assist in meditation, few explore how technology supports development of such skills for independent practice. From a two-phase mixed-methods study, we contribute learner-centered insights from 36 participants in a virtual reality environment designed to teach meditation skills to novices. In Phase I, we gathered affective and behavioral learner needs from 21 meditation novices, experts, and instructors to synthesize insights for learning. We then designed ZenVR: an interactive system to deliver an eight-lesson meditation curriculum to support learners’ progress. In Phase II, we conducted a 6-week longitudinal lab-based evaluation with 15 novice meditation learners. We found statistically significant improvements in mindfulness and self-reported meditation ability. Their insights from a self-managed practice, two weeks after the study ended, offered opportunities to understand how technology can be designed to offer progressive support without creating dependence in technology-mediated meditation practice.

Towards Digital Environmental Stewardship: the Work of Caring for the Environment in Waste Management,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517679,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517679,"
This paper discusses Digital Environmental Stewardship as an analytical framework that can help HCI scholarship to understand, design, and assess sociotechnical interventions concerned with sustainable waste management practices. Drawing on environmental studies, we outline key concepts of environmental stewardship – namely actors, capacity, and motivations – to unpack how different initiatives for handling waste are organised, both through grassroots and top-down interventions, and through varying sociotechnical configurations. We use these dimensions to analyse three different cases of waste management that illustrate how actions of care for the environment are ecologically organised, and what challenges might hinder them beyond –or besides– behavioural motivations. We conclude with a discussion on the orientation to action that the suggested framework provides, and its role in understanding, designing and assessing digital technologies in this domain. We argue that examining how stewardship actions fold into each other helps design sociotechnical interventions for managing waste from within a relational perspective.

A Comparative Evaluation of Interventions Against Misinformation: Augmenting the WHO Checklist,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517717,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06696,"
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization provided a checklist to help people distinguish between accurate and misinformation. In controlled experiments in the United States and Germany, we investigated the utility of this ordered checklist and designed an interactive version to lower the cost of acting on checklist items. Across interventions, we observe non-trivial differences in participants’ performance in distinguishing accurate and misinformation between the two countries and discuss some possible reasons that may predict the future helpfulness of the checklist in different environments. The checklist item that provides source labels was most frequently followed and was considered most helpful. Based on our empirical findings, we recommend practitioners focus on providing source labels rather than interventions that support readers performing their own fact-checks, even though this recommendation may be influenced by the WHO’s chosen order. We discuss the complexity of providing such source labels and provide design recommendations.

 Data visualization is pervasive in the lives of children as they encounter graphs and charts in early education and online media. In spite of this prevalence, our guidelines and understanding of how children perceive graphs stem primarily from studies conducted with adults. Previous psychology and education research indicates that children’s cognitive abilities are different from adults. Therefore, we conducted a classic graphical perception study on a population of children aged 8–12 enrolled in the Ivy After School Program in Boston, MA and adult computer science students enrolled in Northeastern University to determine how accurately participants judge differences in particular graphical encodings. We record the accuracy of participants’ answers for five encodings most commonly used with quantitative data. The results of our controlled experiment show that children have remarkably similar graphical perception to adults, but are consistently less accurate at interpreting the visual encodings. We found similar effectiveness rankings, relative differences in error between the different encodings, and patterns of bias across encoding types. Based on our findings, we provide design guidelines and recommendations for creating visualizations for children. This paper and all supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/ygrdv.

The Reward for Luck: Understanding the Effect of Random Reward Mechanisms in Video Games on Player Experience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517642,5,,"
 Random Reward Mechanisms (RRMs) in video games are systems in which rewards are issued probabilistically upon certain trigger conditions, such as completing gameplay tasks, exceeding a playtime quota, or making in-game purchases. We investigated the relationship between RRM implementations and user experience. Video analysis of 35 RRM systems allowed for the creation of a classification system based on contrasting observed dimensions. Interviews with 14 video game players provided insights into how factors such as the affordances of non-optimal rewards and the trade-off between random luck and skill impact player perception and interaction with RRMs. We additionally investigated the relationship between auditory, visual, and gameplay design decisions and player expectations for RRM reward presentations, finding that the resources required to obtain the reward and the relative value of the reward impact its expected presentation. Finally, we applied our findings to propose design methodologies for creating engaging and significant RRM systems.

"Let's Talk@ Clubhouse: Exploring Voice-Centered Social Media Platform and its Opportunities, Challenges, and Design Guidelines",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519774,3,,"
Due to the pandemic, social media has become an essential route to satisfy socializing needs. Expanding from dominant services like Facebook and Instagram, a new wave caused a stir—Clubhouse as a voice-centered social media platform. Despite its worldwide popularity after its launch in 2020, general properties of Clubhouse have not been actively discussed. Accordingly, this study explores Clubhouse's opportunities and challenges as a voice-centered social media through its user experiences. We conducted interviews with regular Clubhouse users (N=26) to gain insight into their motivation, social networking, and conversations. Findings highlight that voice is effective for establishing social relationships via interactivity and intimacy, mutual respect, and convenience from ephemerality. Conversely, users reported patterns of the privacy paradox and the oligopoly of communication. Design guidelines for future voice-centric social media are proposed. Our initial study of Clubhouse will encourage more dialogues on voice-centered social media and its potential as a major platform.

Math Augmentation: How Authors Enhance the Readability of Formulas using Novel Visual Design Practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501932,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501932,"
With the increasing growth and impact of machine learning and other math-intensive fields, it is more important than ever to broaden access to mathematical notation. Can new visual and interactive displays help a wider readership successfully engage with notation? This paper provides the first detailed qualitative analysis of math augmentation—the practice of embellishing notation with novel visual design patterns to improve its readability. We present two qualitative studies of the practice of math augmentation. First is an analysis of 1.1k augmentations to 281 formulas in 47 blogs, textbooks, and other documents containing mathematical expressions. Second is an interview study with 12 authors who had previously designed custom math augmentations (“maugs”). This paper contributes a comprehensive inventory of the kinds of maugs that appear in math documents, and a detailed account of how authors’ tools ought to be redesigned to support efficient creation of math augmentations. These studies open a critical new design space for HCI researchers and interface designers.

Social media has witnessed an unprecedented growth in users based in low-income communities in the Global South. However, much remains unknown about the drivers of misinformation in such communities. To fill this gap, we conducted an interview-based study to examine how rural and urban communities in India engage with misinformation on WhatsApp. We found that misinformation led to bitterness and conflict – rural users who had higher social status heavily influenced the perceptions and engagement of marginalized members. While urban users relied on the expertise of gatekeepers for verification, rural users engaged in collective deliberations in offline spaces. Both rural and urban users knowingly forwarded misinformation. However, rural users propagated hyperlocal misinformation, whereas urban users forwarded misinformation to reduce their efforts to assess information credibility. Using a public sphere lens, we propose that the reactions to misinformation provide a view of Indian society and its schisms around class, urbanity, and social interactions.

Mymove: Facilitating older adults to collect in-situ activity labels on a smartwatch with speech,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517457,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517457,"
Current activity tracking technologies are largely trained on younger adults’ data, which can lead to solutions that are not well-suited for older adults. To build activity trackers for older adults, it is crucial to collect training data with them. To this end, we examine the feasibility and challenges with older adults in collecting activity labels by leveraging speech. Specifically, we built MyMove, a speech-based smartwatch app to facilitate the in-situ labeling with a low capture burden. We conducted a 7-day deployment study, where 13 older adults collected their activity labels and smartwatch sensor data, while wearing a thigh-worn activity monitor. Participants were highly engaged, capturing 1,224 verbal reports in total. We extracted 1,885 activities with corresponding effort level and timespan, and examined the usefulness of these reports as activity labels. We discuss the implications of our approach and the collected dataset in supporting older adults through personalized activity tracking technologies.

World building or terrain modelling is an essential task when designing games, natural simulations or artistic creations involving virtual 3D landscapes. To support this task, we propose a virtual reality (VR) system based on a pen and touch tablet used in a sitting position (desktop VR) such that both hands are free to interact in an asymmetric way (pen hand + other bare hand). We present and compare several techniques to perform navigation, sculpting and menu operations using the two hands, which interact on and above the tablet surface, i.e. using the pen, touch and mid-air input spaces. A qualitative evaluation with 16 participants confirms the entertaining nature and practical benefits of our system. The study further underlines the complementarity of the different modalities and identifies the promising—and as of yet underexplored—combination of bimanual touch + pen + mid-air interaction in desktop VR.

CatchLive: real-time summarization of live streams with stream content and interaction data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517461,7,,"
 Live streams usually last several hours with many viewers joining in the middle. Viewers who join in the middle often want to understand what has happened in the stream. However, catching up with the earlier parts is challenging because it is difficult to know which parts are important in the long, unedited stream while also keeping up with the ongoing stream. We present CatchLive, a system that provides a real-time summary of ongoing live streams by utilizing both the stream content and user interaction data. CatchLive provides viewers with an overview of the stream along with summaries of highlight moments with multiple levels of detail in a readable format. Results from deployments of three streams with 67 viewers show that CatchLive helps viewers grasp the overview of the stream, identify important moments, and stay engaged. Our findings provide insights into designing summarizations of live streams reflecting their characteristics.

 Makeup and cosmetics offer the potential for self-expression and the reshaping of social roles for visually impaired people. However, there exist barriers to conducting a beauty regime because of the reliance on visual information and color variances in makeup. We present a content analysis of 145 YouTube videos to demonstrate visually impaired individuals’ unique practices before, during, and after doing makeup. Based on the makeup practices, we then conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 visually impaired people to discuss their perceptions of and challenges with the makeup process in more depth. Overall, through our findings and discussion, we present novel perceptions of makeup from visually impaired individuals (e.g., broader representations of blindness and beauty). The existing challenges provide opportunities for future research to address learning barriers, insufficient feedback, and physical and environmental barriers, making the experience of doing makeup more accessible to people with visual impairments.

 This paper reports on Zoom Obscura – an artist-based design research project, responding to the ubiquity of video-conferencing as a technical and cultural phenomenon throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. As enterprise software, such as Zoom, rapidly came to mediate even the most personal and intimate interactions, we supported and collaborated with seven independent artists to explore technical and creative interventions in video-conferencing. Our call for participation sought critical interventions that would help users counter, and regain agency in regard to the various ways in which personal data is captured, transmitted and processed in video-conferencing tools. In this design study, we analyse post-hoc how each of the seven projects employed aspects of counterfunctional design to achieve these aims. Each project reveals different avenues and strategies for counterfunctionality in video-conferencing software, as well as opportunities to design critically towards interactions and experiences that challenge existing norms and expectations around these platforms.

FabricatINK: Personal Fabrication of Bespoke Displays Using Electronic Ink from Upcycled E Readers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501844,8,https://olliehanton.github.io/CHI2022_FabricatINK.pdf,"
Abstract: FabricatINK explores the personal fabrication of irregularly-shaped low-power displays using electronic ink (E ink). E ink is a programmable bicolour material used in traditional form-factors such as E readers. It has potential for more versatile use within the scope of personal fabrication of custom-shaped displays, and it has the promise to be the pre-eminent material choice for this purpose. We appraise technical literature to identify properties of E ink, suited to fabrication. We identify a key roadblock, universal access to E ink as a material, and we deliver a method to circumvent this by upcycling broken electronics. We subsequently present a novel fabrication method for irregularly-shaped E ink displays. We demonstrate our fabrication process and E ink’s versatility through ten prototypes showing different applications and use cases. By addressing E ink as a material for display fabrication, we uncover the potential for users to create custom-shaped truly bistable displays.

We present FoolProofJoint, a software tool that simplifies the assembly of laser-cut 3D models and reduces the risk of erroneous assembly. FoolProofJoint achieves this by modifying finger joint patterns. Wherever possible, FoolProofJoint makes similar looking pieces fully interchangeable, thereby speeding up the user's visual search for a matching piece. When that is not possible, FoolProofJoint gives finger joints a unique pattern of individual finger placements so as to fit only with the correct piece, thereby preventing erroneous assembly. In our benchmark set of 217 laser-cut 3D models downloaded from kyub.com, FoolProofJoint made groups of similar looking pieces fully interchangeable for 65% of all groups of similar pieces; FoolProofJoint fully prevented assembly mistakes for 97% of all models.

(Re) Politicizing Digital Well-Being: Beyond User Engagements,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501857,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501857,"
 The psychological costs of the attention economy are often considered through the binary of harmful design and healthy use, with digital well-being chiefly characterised as a matter of personal responsibility. This article adopts an interdisciplinary approach to highlight the empirical, ideological, and political limits of embedding this individualised perspective in computational discourses and designs of digital well-being measurement. We will reveal well-being to be a culturally specific and environmentally conditioned concept and will problematize user engagement as a universal proxy for well-being. Instead, the contributing factors of user well-being will be located in environing social, cultural, and political conditions far beyond the control of individual users alone. In doing so, we hope to reinvigorate the issue of digital well-being measurement as a nexus point of political concern, through which multiple disciplines can study experiences of digital ill as symptomatic of wider social inequalities and (capitalist) relations of power.

How accurate does it feel?–human perception of different types of classification mistakes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501915,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501915,"
 Supervised machine learning utilizes large datasets, often with ground truth labels annotated by humans. While some data points are easy to classify, others are hard to classify, which reduces the inter-annotator agreement. This causes noise for the classifier and might affect the user’s perception of the classifier’s performance. In our research, we investigated whether the classification difficulty of a data point influences how strongly a prediction mistake reduces the “perceived accuracy”. In an experimental online study, 225 participants interacted with three fictive classifiers with equal accuracy (73%). The classifiers made prediction mistakes on three different types of data points (easy, difficult, impossible). After the interaction, participants judged the classifier’s accuracy. We found that not all prediction mistakes reduced the perceived accuracy equally. Furthermore, the perceived accuracy differed significantly from the calculated accuracy. To conclude, accuracy and related measures seem unsuitable to represent how users perceive the performance of classifiers.

GANSlider: How Users Control Generative Models for Images using Multiple Sliders with and without Feedforward Information,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502141,8,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00965,"
We investigate how multiple sliders with and without feedforward visualizations influence users’ control of generative models. In an online study (N=138), we collected a dataset of people interacting with a generative adversarial network (StyleGAN2) in an image reconstruction task. We found that more control dimensions (sliders) significantly increase task difficulty and user actions. Visual feedforward partly mitigates this by enabling more goal-directed interaction. However, we found no evidence of faster or more accurate task performance. This indicates a tradeoff between feedforward detail and implied cognitive costs, such as attention. Moreover, we found that visualizations alone are not always sufficient for users to understand individual control dimensions. Our study quantifies fundamental UI design factors and resulting interaction behavior in this context, revealing opportunities for improvement in the UI design for interactive applications of generative models. We close by discussing design directions and further aspects.

Unmaking as Agonism: Using Participatory Design with Youth to Surface Difference in an Intergenerational Urban Context,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501930,9,http://represent.org/publications/papers/sabie_unmaking_as_agonism.pdf,"
 Design has been used to contest existing socio-technical arrangements, provoke conversations around matters of concern, and operationalize radical theories such as agonism, which embraces difference and contention. However, the focus is usually on creating something new: a product, interface or artifact. In this paper, we investigate what happens when critical unmaking is deployed as a deliberate design strategy in an intergenerational, agonistic urban context. Specifically, we report on how youth in a six-week design internship used unmaking as a design move to subvert conventional narratives about their surrounding urban context. We analyze how this led to conflictual encounters at the local senior center, and compare it to the other, making-centric proposals which received favorable feedback but failed to raise the same important discussions. Through this ethnographic account, we argue that critical unmaking is important yet overlooked, and should be in the repertoire of design moves available for agonism and provocation.

How AI-based training affected the performance of professional Go players,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517540,7,,"
 In this study, we analyzed how the performance of professional Go players has changed since the advent of AlphaGo, the first artificial intelligence (AI) application to defeat a human world Go champion. We interviewed and surveyed professional Go players and found that AI has been actively introduced into the Go training process since the advent of AlphaGo. The significant impact of AI-based training was confirmed in a subsequent analysis of 6,292 games in Korean Go tournaments and Elo rating data of 1,362 Go players worldwide. Overall, the tendency of players to make moves similar to those recommended by AI has sharply increased since 2017. The degree to which players’ expected win rates fluctuate during a game has also decreased significantly since 2017. We also found that AI-based training has provided more benefits to senior players and allowed them to achieve Elo ratings higher than those of junior players.

Immersive speculative enactments: bringing future scenarios and technology to life using virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517492,10,,"
 In this paper we present Immersive Speculative Enactments (ISEs), a novel concept that extends conventional Speculative Enactments to Virtual Reality. Through ISEs, participants are immersed in a speculative world depicted by the designers and can engage with it in its truest envisioned form. We explore this concept via four scenarios with increasing technological uncertainty: a glimpse in the daily life of the parent of a newborn baby; a Mixed Reality experience supporting hybrid classrooms; two wearable devices that present a pet’s emotional state and needs; and an enactment on the effect of communication delay across interplanetary distances. We discuss the concept of ISEs and contrast them to other forms of speculation, provide guidelines on how to design them, as well as reflecting on the challenges, limitations, and potential associated with the role of ISEs in the HCI discourse.

 Home energy management systems (HEMS) offer control and the ability to manage energy, generating and collecting energy consumption data at the most detailed level. However, data at this level poses various privacy concerns, including, for instance, profiling consumer behaviors and large-scale surveillance. The question of how utility providers can get value from such data without infringing consumers’ privacy has remained under-investigated. We address this gap by exploring the pro-sharing attitudes and privacy perceptions of 30 HEMS users and non-users through an interview study. While participants are concerned about data misuse and stigmatization, our analysis also reveals that incentives, altruism, trust, security and privacy, transparency and accountability encourage data sharing. From this analysis, we derive privacy design strategies for HEMS that can both improve privacy and engender adoption.

What We Talk About When We Talk About Human-Computer Integration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516509,2,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146216/3491101.3516509.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
 In 2017, a CHI panel titled “Integration vs Powerful tools” debated whether our relationship with digital technology had begun to shift from interaction to integration. Today, Human-Computer integration developed into an emerging paradigm, rapidly gaining traction and developing a theoretical basis over a number of recent symposiums and publications. However, as more contributions are made to the establishment of Human-Computer Integration, the more its concepts and principles seem to diverge, such that we now find that each theorist talks about something different when they say “integration”. Building on the 2017 panel, in this panel, we ask “What is the essence of Human-Computer Integration? And what are its implications for the future of HCI?” This panel seeks to facilitate discourse between leading thinkers from diverse backgrounds with the audience to come to a shared vision and mutual understanding of human-computer integration.

A large-scale measurement of cybercrime against individuals,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517613,10,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517613,"
 We know surprisingly little about the prevalence and severity of cybercrime in the U.S. Yet, in order to prioritize the development and distribution of advice and technology to protect end users, we require empirical evidence regarding cybercrime. Measuring crime, including cybercrime, is a challenging problem that relies on a combination of direct crime reports to the government – which have known issues of under-reporting – and assessment via carefully-designed self-report surveys. We report on the first large-scale, nationally representative academic survey (n=11,953) of consumer cybercrime experiences in the U.S. Our analysis answers four research questions: (1) What is the prevalence and (2) the monetary impact of these cybercrimes we measure in the U.S.?, (3) Do inequities exist in victimization?, and (4) Can we improve cybercrime measurement by leveraging social-reporting techniques used to measure physical crime? Our analysis also offers insight toward improving future measurement of cybercrime and protecting users.

Would Users Accept Electric Muscle Stimulation Controlling Their Body? Insights from a Scenario-Based Investigation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519693,2,,"
 Electric muscle stimulation (EMS) offers rich opportunities for haptic interaction. However, there is no comprehensive study assessing the user acceptance of this technology. Consequently, we synthesized four scenarios (motor learning, virtual reality, media player control, and pedestrian safety) based on various dimensions identified by the literature review. We assessed their user acceptance in an online survey (N=113) using the technology acceptance model (TAM). Our findings suggest that users may reject EMS systems if they perceive a high level of risk and lack of control over the environment. This was evident even in scenarios that could provide high benefits to users, such as accelerating the learning curve in motoric tasks. In contrast, EMS seems to be widely accepted for games and entertainment, represented by the virtual reality scenario in our study. HCI researchers should employ EMS to create more engaging VR experiences, keep users in control, and provide them the option of learning skills with or without EMS. Our results will help build better EMS systems accepted by users.

“Elinor's Talking to Me!”: Integrating Conversational AI into Children's Narrative Science Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502050,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502050,"
 Video programs are important, accessible educational resources for young children, especially those from an under-resourced backgrounds. These programs’ potential can be amplified if children are allowed to socially interact with media characters during their video watching. This paper presents the design and empirical investigation of interactive science-focused videos in which the main character, powered by a conversational agent, engaged in contingent conversation with children by asking children questions and providing responsive feedback. We found that children actively interacted with the media character in the conversational videos and their parents spontaneously provided support in the process. We also found that the children who watched the conversational video performed better in the immediate, episode-specific science assessment compared to their peers who watched the broadcast, non-interactive version of the same episode. Several design implications are discussed for using conversational technologies to better support child active learning and parent involvement in video watching.

Adaptive empathy learning support in peer review scenarios,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517740,7,https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/bitstreams/f71c8b91-d7d7-4202-862d-fd4d58471c6e/download,"
 Advances in Natural Language Processing offer techniques to detect the empathy level in texts. To test if individual feedback on certain students’ empathy level in their peer review writing process will help them to write more empathic reviews, we developed ELEA, an adaptive writing support system that provides students with feedback on the cognitive and emotional empathy structures. We compared ELEA to a proven empathy support tool in a peer review setting with 119 students. We found students using ELEA wrote more empathic peer reviews with a higher level of emotional empathy compared to the control group. The high perceived skill learning, the technology acceptance, and the level of enjoyment provide promising results to use such an approach as a feedback application in traditional learning settings. Our results indicate that learning applications based on NLP are able to foster empathic writing skills of students in peer review scenarios.

Characterizing and Predicting Engagement of Blind and Low-Vision People with an Audio-Based Navigation App,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519862,3,https://files.sigchi.org/conference/attachment/10072/content/73079/poster/01ae155a-8a9f-7678-f5cb-a1f10bc8e0cf.pdf,"
 Audio-based navigation technologies can help people who are blind or have low vision (BLV) with more independent navigation, mobility, and orientation. We explore how such technologies are incorporated into their daily lives using machine learning models trained on the engagement patterns of over 4,700 BLV people. For mobile navigation apps, we identify user engagement features like the duration of first-time use and engagement with spatial audio callouts that are greatly relevant to predicting user retention. This work contributes a more holistic understanding of important features associated with user retention and strong app usage, as well as insight into the exploration of ambient surroundings as a compelling use case for assistive navigation apps. Finally, we provide design implications to improve the accessibility and usability of audio-based navigation technology.

“A Reasonable Thing to Ask For”: Towards a Unified Voice in Privacy Collective Action,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517467,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517467,"
 People feel concerned, angry, and powerless when subjected to surveillance, data breaches and other privacy-violating experiences with institutions (PVEIs). Collective action may empower groups of people affected by a PVEI to jointly demand redress, but a necessary first step is for the collective to agree on demands. We designed a sensitizing prototype to explore how to shepherd a collective to generate a unified set of demands for redress in response to a triggering PVEI. We found that collectives can converge on high-priority concerns and demands for redress, and that many of their demands indicated preferences for broad reform. We then gathered a panel of security and privacy experts to react to the collective’s demands. Experts were dismissive, preferring incremental measures that cleanly mapped onto existing legal structures. We argue this misalignment may help uphold the power chasm between data-harvesting institutions and the individuals whose personal data they monetize.

Barriers to online dementia information and mitigation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517554,6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9201622/,"
There is growing interest in HCI to study ways to support access to accurate, accessible, relevant online health information for different populations. Yet, there remains a need to understand the barriers that are posed by the way our platforms are designed as well as how we might overcome these barriers for people with dementia. To address this, we conducted sixteen interviews and observation sessions with people with mild to moderate dementia. Our analysis uncovered four barriers to online health information and corresponding mitigation strategies that participants employed. We discuss how HCI researchers may apply these findings towards new technical approaches and standards concerning information accessibility and credibility for neurodiverse populations. Finally, we broaden the scope of HCI research to include investigations of the accessibility and credibility of online information for people with age-related cognitive impairment independent of proxies.

EyeMeet: A Joint Attention Support System for Remote Meetings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519792,5,https://scholar.archive.org/work/bm7kwvcvyngh7n7rmtyt4ps5me/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519792,"
 A major challenge in remote meetings is that awareness cues, such as gaze, become degraded despite playing a crucial role in communication and establishing joint attention. Eye tracking allows overcoming these obstacles by enabling augmentation of remote meetings with gaze information. In this project, we followed a participatory approach by first distributing a scenario-based survey to students (n=79) to uncover their preference of eye-based joint attention support (real-time, retrospective, real-time & retrospective, no) for remote university meetings. Building on these findings, we developed EyeMeet, an eye-based joint attention support system that combines state-of-the-art real-time joint attention support with a retrospective attention feedback for remote meetings. In a four-week study, two student groups worked remotely on course assignments using EyeMeet. Our findings of the study highlight that EyeMeets supports students in staying more focused on the meetings. Complementing real-time joint attention support, retrospective joint attention feedback is recognized to provide valuable support for reflecting and adapting behavior for upcoming meetings.

"” By the way, what's your name?”: The Effect of Robotic Bar-stools on Human-human Opening-encounters",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519726,2,https://milab.runi.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ofir.pdf,"
 Opening-encounters are an integral element of social interaction and are essential for social relationships. Specifically, opening-encounters between strangers form a complex social context and often involve awkwardness and tension. We explored whether augmenting everyday objects with autonomous capabilities can facilitate an opening-encounter between strangers. A pair of robotic bar-stools were designed to rotate participants sitting on them. We evaluated the opening-encounter experience in three conditions: bar-stools rotating participants towards one another; bar-stools rotating participants away from one another; and bar-stools with no rotation. Our initial findings indicate that rotating participants towards each other led to positive encounters, encouraged social interaction, and increased interpersonal communication. The other two conditions were less likely to initiate social interactions. This preliminary study highlights the potential of facilitating positive opening-encounters using autonomous furniture that are perceived as a natural part of the interaction, without altering its human-human nature.

VR [we are] Training-Workshop on Collaborative Virtual Training for Challenging Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503710,2,https://xcelab.tech-experience.at/CR/Regal-et-al_VR_Training_preprint.pdf,"
 Virtual reality provides great opportunities to simulate various environments and situations as reproducible and controllable training environments. Training is an inherently collaborative effort, with trainees and trainers working together to achieve specific goals. Recently, we have seen considerable effort to use virtual training environments (VTEs) in many demanding training contexts, e.g. police training, medical first responder training, firefighter training etc. For such contexts, trainers and trainees must undertake various roles as supervisors, adaptors, role players, and observers in training, making collaboration complex, but essential for training success. These social and multi-user aspects for collaborative VTEs have received little investigation so far. Therefore, we propose this workshop to discuss the potential and perspectives of VTEs for challenging training settings. In a one-day online workshop, researchers and practitioners will jointly develop a research agenda on how currently underrepresented aspects of social and collaborative work can be integrated into VR-supported training. This workshop will focus on two themes: (1) Multi-sensory experience: novel collaborative interfaces for VTEs (e.g. joint use of tangible devices, strategies for preventing simulator-induced negative effects); (2) Multi-user interaction: collaboration in VTEs between trainers (two trainers run a scenarios jointly), trainers and trainees /the trainer controls the scenario for a trainee), and trainees with each other (e.g. two trainees solve an exercise together)

This paper introduces MoodTurner, a wearable and mobile system that supports individuals in the self-care of high sensory processing sensitivity. We discuss how different aspects of personal informatics and embodied perception can be combined to help individuals in the tracking and reflecting on episodes of high sensory processing sensitivity, and overcome stigmatisation associated with the use of tracking tools. We present the design of a smart jewellery that tracks where episodes take place as well as their severity and a complementary mobile application that allows users to review and document episodes of high sensory processing sensitivity.

DreamStream: Immersive and Interactive Spectating in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517508,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517508,"
 Today spectating and streaming virtual reality (VR) activities typically involves spectators viewing a 2D stream of the VR user’s view. Streaming 2D videos of the game play is popular and well-supported by platforms such as Twitch. However, the generic streaming of full 3D representations is less explored. Thus, while the VR player’s experience may be fully immersive, spectators are limited to 2D videos. This asymmetry lessens the overall experience for spectators, who themselves may be eager to spectate in VR. DreamStream puts viewers in the virtual environment of the VR application, allowing them to look “over the shoulder” of the VR player. Spectators can view streamed VR content immersively in 3D, independently explore the VR scene beyond what the VR player sees and ultimately cohabit the virtual environment alongside the VR player. For the VR player, DreamStream provides a spatial awareness of all their spectators. DreamStream retrofits and works with existing VR applications. We discuss the design and implementation of DreamStream, and carry out three qualitative informal evaluations. These evaluations shed light on the strengths and weakness of using DreamStream for the purpose of interactive spectating. Our participants found that DreamStream’s VR viewer interface offered increased immersion, and made it easier to communicate and interact with the VR player.

Attending to the challenges of describing first-person experience, this article illustrates different uses of the Focusing method in interaction design and HCI, offering a systematic way of accessing the subtle qualities of lived experiences for design use. In this approach, the implicit bodily knowledge -or felt sense- becomes the material capture of aesthetic experiences used to inform data collection, ideation and prototyping. We offer a high-level, yet systematic coverage of Focusing applied to two case studies, informing both a set of instructions to use the method and a series of design considerations to adopt this understudied tool of introspection in interaction design research and practice.

Apéritif: Scaffolding preregistrations to automatically generate analysis code and methods descriptions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517707,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517707,"
 The HCI community has been advocating preregistration as a practice to improve the credibility of scientific research. However, it remains unclear how HCI researchers preregister studies and what preregistration users perceive as benefits and challenges. By systematically reviewing the past four CHI proceedings and surveying 11 researchers, we found that only 1.11% of papers presented preregistered studies, though both authors and reviewers of preregistered studies perceive it as beneficial. Our formative studies revealed key challenges ranging from a lack of detail about the study design, hindering comprehensibility, to inconsistencies between preregistrations and published papers. To explore ways for addressing these issues, we developed Apéritif, a research prototype that scaffolds the preregistration process and automatically generates analysis code and a methods description. In an evaluation with 17 HCI researchers, we found that Apéritif reduces the effort of preregistering a study, facilitates researchers’ workflows, and promotes consistency between research artifacts.

Meerkat: A Social Community Support Application for Older Adults,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519909,2,,"
Meerkat is a social support app that helps older adults tackle hurdles in interacting with mobile applications by receiving contextual support from friends and family or community volunteers. The app allows users to describe the interaction issue, capture a screenshot, draw, and write queries to helpers who can provide understandable explanations. Meerkat is informed by theories of collective efficacy and aims to reduce the barriers to existing social networks. Given COVID-19 social distancing measures, the design of Meerkat adapts patterns of peer support to situations where the users are not co-located. To users who do not have available social support, the app provides a foundation to receive support from a community of volunteers who are social connections to other users. Meerkat also includes a practice mode, facilitating social learning by presenting users with mobile tasks. We conclude with how Meerkat can contribute to collective and individual efficacy.

Maptimizer: Using Optimization to Tailor Tactile Maps to Users Needs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517436,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517436,"
 Tactile maps can help people who are blind or have low-vision navigate and familiarize themselves with unfamiliar locations. Ideally, tactile maps can be customized to an individual’s unique needs and abilities because of their limited space for representation. We present Maptimizer, a tool that generates tactile maps based on users’ preferences and requirements. Maptimizer uses a two stage optimization process to pair representations with geographic information and tune those representations to present that information more clearly. In a small user study, Maptimizer helped participants more successfully and efficiently identify locations of interest in unknown areas. These results demonstrate the utility of optimization techniques and generative design in complex accessibility domains.

"“So Close, yet So Far”: Exploring Sexual-minority Women's Relationship-building via Online Dating in China",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517624,5,http://naomi-yamashita.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022jp-02.pdf,"
 Sexual-minority women (SMWs) in China are often subject to strong stigmatization and tend to have limited opportunities to connect with other SMWs in offline contexts. Although dating apps help them connect and seek social support, little is known about SMWs’ practices of self-disclosure and connection-building through those apps. To address this gap, we interviewed 43 SMW dating-app users in China. We found that these SMWs developed distinctive self-disclosure strategies, such as posting non-facial photos and implicitly disclosing their whereabouts by blending location information into photos that only those in the know could understand, to avoid interference from aggressive acquaintances and other risks of unintentional disclosure of their SMW identities. Moreover, they used dating apps not only to recognize other SMWs offline and build relationships with them, but to exchange emotional support in the process of SMW identity development. Our findings have design implications for supporting SMWs and improving their online dating experiences.

 Sketching is a universal activity that first appears when we play as children, but later, it is often overlooked as a useful skill in adult work – yet it can bring multiple benefits to research and practice. Specifically, our field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) embraces interdisciplinary practices, and amongst those, sketching has proven to be a valuable addition to the skill set of researchers, practitioners, and educators in both academia and industry. Many individuals lack the confidence to take up pen and paper after years of non-practice, but it is possible to re-learn these lost skills, improve on them, and apply them in practical ways to all areas of work and research. This course offers a journey in sketching, from scribbles and playful interpretations to hands-on and theoretical information inherent in sketching practice. Attending individuals will learn techniques and applied methods for utilizing sketching within the context of HCI, guided by experienced instructors.

 Real-world IoT enhanced spaces involve diverse proximity- and gesture-based interactions between users and IoT devices/objects. Prototyping such interactions benefits various applications like the conceptual design of ubicomp space. AR (Augmented Reality) prototyping provides a flexible way to achieve early-stage designs by overlaying digital contents on real objects or environments. However, existing AR prototyping approaches have focused on prototyping AR experiences or context-aware interactions from the first-person view instead of full-body proxemic and gestural (pro-ges for short) interactions of real users in the real world. In this work, we conducted interviews to figure out the challenges of prototyping pro-ges interactions in real-world IoT enhanced spaces. Based on the findings, we present ProGesAR, a mobile AR tool for prototyping pro-ges interactions of a subject in a real environment from a third-person view, and examining the prototyped interactions from both the first- and third- person views. Our interface supports the effects of virtual assets dynamically triggered by a single subject, with the triggering events based on four features: location, orientation, gesture, and distance. We conduct a preliminary study by inviting participants to prototype in a freeform manner using ProGesAR. The early-stage findings show that with ProGesAR, users can easily and quickly prototype their design ideas about pro-ges interactions.

One Week in the Future: Previs Design Futuring for HCI Research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517584,7,,"
 We explore the use of cinematic “pre-visualization” (previs) techniques as a rapid ideation and design futuring method for human computer interaction (HCI) research. Previs approaches, which are widely used in animation and film production, use digital design tools to create medium-fidelity videos that capture richer interaction, motion, and context than sketches or static illustrations. When used as a design futuring method, previs can facilitate rapid, iterative discussions that reveal tensions, challenges, and opportunities for new research. We performed eight one-week design futuring sprints, in which individual HCI researchers collaborated with a lead designer to produce concept sketches, storyboards, and videos that examined future applications of their research. From these experiences, we identify recurring themes and challenges and present a One Week Futuring Workbook that other researchers can use to guide their own futuring sprints. We also highlight how variations of our approach could support other speculative design practices.

Tapgazer: Text entry with finger tapping and gaze-directed word selection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501838,6,https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/files/234639843/TapGazer_CHI_22_.pdf,"
 While using VR, efficient text entry is a challenge: users cannot easily locate standard physical keyboards, and keys are often out of reach, e.g. when standing. We present TapGazer, a text entry system where users type by tapping their fingers in place. Users can tap anywhere as long as the identity of each tapping finger can be detected with sensors. Ambiguity between different possible input words is resolved by selecting target words with gaze. If gaze tracking is unavailable, ambiguity is resolved by selecting target words with additional taps. We evaluated TapGazer for seated and standing VR: seated novice users using touchpads as tap surfaces reached 44.81 words per minute (WPM), 79.17% of their QWERTY typing speed. Standing novice users tapped on their thighs with touch-sensitive gloves, reaching 45.26 WPM (71.91%). We analyze TapGazer with a theoretical performance model and discuss its potential for text input in future AR scenarios.

Understanding How Programmers Can Use Annotations on Documentation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502095,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502095,"
Modern software development requires developers to find and effectively utilize new APIs and their documentation, but documentation has many well-known issues. Despite this, developers eventually overcome these issues but have no way of sharing what they learned. We investigate sharing this documentation-specific information through annotations, which have advantages over developer forums as the information is contextualized, not disruptive, and is short, thus easy to author. Developers can also author annotations to support their own comprehension. In order to support the documentation usage behaviors we found, we built the Adamite annotation tool, which provides features such as multiple anchors, annotation types, and pinning. In our user study, we found that developers are able to create annotations that are useful to themselves and are able to utilize annotations created by other developers when learning a new API, with readers of the annotations completing 67% more of the task, on average, than the baseline.

"Field evidence of the effects of privacy, data transparency, and pro-social appeals on COVID-19 app attractiveness",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501869,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501869,"
 COVID-19 exposure-notification apps have struggled to gain adoption. Existing literature posits as potential causes of this low adoption: privacy concerns, insufficient data transparency, and the type of appeal – collective- vs. individual-good – used to frame the app. As policy guidance suggests using tailored advertising to evaluate the effects of these factors, we present the first field study of COVID-19 contact tracing apps with a randomized, control trial of 14 different advertisements for CovidDefense, Louisiana’s COVID-19 exposure-notification app. We find that all three hypothesized factors – privacy, data transparency, and appeals framing – relate to app adoption, even when controlling for age, gender, and community density. Our results offer (1) the first field evidence supporting the use of collective-good appeals, (2) nuanced findings regarding the efficacy of data and privacy transparency, the effects of which are moderated by appeal framing and potential users’ demographics, and (3) field-evidence-based guidance for future efforts to encourage pro-social health technology adoption.

Empathic vehicles are expected to improve user experience in automated vehicles and to help increase user acceptance of technology. However, little is known about potential real-world implementations and designs using empathic interfaces in vehicles with higher levels of automation. Given advances in affect detection and emotion mitigation, we conducted two workshops (N1 =24, N2 = 22, Ntotal = 46) on the design of empathic vehicles and their potential utility in a variety of applications. This paper recapitulates key opportunities in the design and application of empathetic interfaces in automated vehicles which emerged from the two workshops hosted at the ACM AutoUI conferences.

 Now more than ever, people are using online platforms to communicate. Twitch, the foremost platform for live game streaming, offers many communication modalities. However, the platform lacks representation of social cues and signals of the audience experience, which are innately present in live events. To address this, we present a technology probe that captures the audience energy and response in a game streaming context. We designed a game and integrated a custom-communication modality—Commons Sense—in which the audience members’ heart rates are sensed via webcam, averaged, and fed into a video game to affect sound, lighting, and difficulty. We conducted an ‘in-the-wild’ evaluation with four Twitch streamers and their audience members (N=55) to understand how these groups interacted through Commons Sense. Audience members and streamers indicated high levels of enjoyment and engagement with Commons Sense, suggesting the potential of physiological interaction as a beneficial communication tool in live streaming.

Children are being presented with augmented reality (AR) in different contexts, such as education and gaming. However, little is known about how children conceptualize AR, especially AR headsets. Prior work has shown that children's interaction behaviors and expectations of technological devices can be quite different from adults’. It is important to understand children's mental models of AR headsets to design more effective experiences for them. To elicit children's perceptions, we conducted four participatory design sessions with ten children on designing content for imaginary AR headsets. We found that children expect AR systems to be highly intelligent and to recognize and virtually transform surroundings to create immersive environments. Also, children are in favor of using these devices for difficult tasks but prefer to work on their own for easy tasks. Our work contributes new understanding on how children comprehend AR headsets and provides recommendations for designing future headsets for children.

MyDJ: Sensing Food Intakes with an Attachable on Your Eyeglass Frame,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502041,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502041,"
 Various automated eating detection wearables have been proposed to monitor food intakes. While these systems overcome the forgetfulness of manual user journaling, they typically show low accuracy at outside-the-lab environments or have intrusive form-factors (e.g., headgear). Eyeglasses are emerging as a socially-acceptable eating detection wearable, but existing approaches require custom-built frames and consume large power. We propose MyDJ, an eating detection system that could be attached to any eyeglass frame. MyDJ achieves accurate and energy-efficient eating detection by capturing complementary chewing signals on a piezoelectric sensor and an accelerometer. We evaluated the accuracy and wearability of MyDJ with 30 subjects in uncontrolled environments, where six subjects attached MyDJ on their own eyeglasses for a week. Our study shows that MyDJ achieves 0.919 F1-score in eating episode coverage, with 4.03 × battery time over the state-of-the-art systems. In addition, participants reported wearing MyDJ was almost as comfortable (94.95%) as wearing regular eyeglasses.

Interacting By Drawing: Introducing Machine Learning Ideas to Children at a K–9 Science Fair,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503574,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matti-Tedre/publication/360279395_Interacting_By_Drawing_Introducing_Machine_Learning_Ideas_to_Children_at_a_K-9_Science_Fair/links/63b2adf8a03100368a476b4b/Interacting-By-Drawing-Introducing-Machine-Learning-Ideas-to-Children-at-a-K-9-Science-Fair.pdf,"
 In the 2010s machine learning (ML) became a key driver of quickly growing number of apps and services. How to teach ML and other data-driven approaches in K–12 education has become a focus of intensive research efforts, with many recent advances in technology, pedagogy, and classroom integration. What to teach learners, at what age, and how, are some of the open questions being explored.  This study explored children’s interactions with a simple image classification tool, which used only two features to classify images. The results offer a proof-of-concept of how to teach 1) the principles of the ML workflow, and 2) some central ML insights, including image recognition, supervised learning, training data, model, feature, classifying, and accuracy. The results recognize how learning the principles of technology facilitates a shift in the locus of explanation from what oneself does to what the computer does. The results provide examples of how to support children’s developing data agency.

To self-persuade or be persuaded: Examining interventions for users' privacy setting selection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502009,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502009,"
 User adoption of security and privacy (S&P) best practices remains low, despite sustained efforts by researchers and practitioners. Social influence is a proven method for guiding user S&P behavior, though most work has focused on studying peer influence, which is only possible with a known social graph. In a study of 104 Facebook users, we instead demonstrate that crowdsourced S&P suggestions are significantly influential. We also tested how reflective writing affected participants’ S&P decisions, with and without suggestions. With reflective writing, participants were less likely to accept suggestions — both social and Facebook default suggestions. Of particular note, when reflective writing participants were shown the Facebook default suggestion, they not only rejected it but also (unknowingly) configured their settings in accordance with expert recommendations. Our work suggests that both non-personal social influence and reflective writing can positively influence users’ S&P decisions, but have negative interactions.

Identifying factors that inhibit self-care behavior among individuals with severe spinal cord injury,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517658,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517658,"
Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) need to perform numerous self-care behaviors, some very frequently. Pressure reliefs (PRs), which prevent life-threatening pressure ulcers (PUs), are one such behavior. We conducted a qualitative study with seven individuals with severe SCI—who depend on power wheelchairs—to explore their current PR behavior and the potential for technology to facilitate PR adherence. While our participants were highly motivated to perform PRs because of prior PUs, we found that their understanding of how and when to perform a PR differed by individual, and that while they sometimes forgot to perform PR, in other cases contextual factors made it difficult to perform a PR. Our findings provide insight into the complexity of this design space, identify design considerations for designing technology to facilitate these behaviors, and demonstrate the opportunity for personal informatics to be more inclusive by supporting the needs of this population.

E-ScootAR: Exploring Unimodal Warnings for E-Scooter Riders in Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519831,2,http://andriimatviienko.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/chi22l-sub7727-cam-i48.pdf,"
 Micro-mobility is becoming a more popular means of transportation. However, this increased popularity brings its challenges. In particular, the accident rates for E-Scooter riders increase, which endangers the riders and other road users. In this paper, we explore the idea of augmenting E-Scooters with unimodal warnings to prevent collisions with other road users, which include Augmented Reality (AR) notifications, vibrotactile feedback on the handlebar, and auditory signals in the AR glasses. We conducted an outdoor experiment (N = 13) using an Augmented Reality simulation and compared these types of warnings in terms of reaction time, accident rate, and feeling of safety. Our results indicate that AR and auditory warnings lead to shorter reaction times, have a better perception, and create a better feeling of safety than vibrotactile warnings. Moreover, auditory signals have a higher acceptance by the riders compared to the other two types of warnings.

 Basketball writers and journalists report on the sport that millions of fans follow and love. However, the recent emergence of pervasive data about the sport and the growth of new forms of sports analytics is changing writers’ jobs. While these writers seek to leverage the data and analytics to create engaging, data-driven stories, they typically lack the technical background to perform analytics or efficiently explore data. We investigated and analyzed the work and context of basketball writers, interviewed nine stakeholders to understand the challenges from a holistic view. Based on what we learned, we designed and constructed two interactive visualization systems that support rapid and in-depth sports data exploration and sense-making to enhance their articles and reporting. We deployed the systems during the recent NBA playoffs to gather initial feedback. This article describes the visualization design study we conducted, the resulting visualization systems, and what we learned to potentially help basketball writers in the future.

Investigating older adults' attitudes towards crisis informatics tools: Opportunities for enhancing community resilience during disasters,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517528,7,,"
 The world population is projected to rapidly age over the next 30 years. Given the increasing digital technology adoption amongst older adults, researchers have investigated how technology can support aging populations. However, little work has examined how technology can support older adults during crises, despite increasingly common natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other crisis scenarios in which older adults are especially vulnerable. Addressing this gap, we conducted focus groups with older adults residing in coastal locations to examine to what extent they felt technology could support them during emergencies. Our findings characterize participants’ desire for tools that enhance community resilience-local knowledge, preparedness, community relationships, and communication, that help communities withstand disasters. Further, older adults’ crisis technology preferences were linked to their sense of control, social relationships, and digital readiness. We discuss how a focus on community resilience can yield crisis technologies that more effectively support older adults.

Personal fabrication is made more accessible through repositories like Thingiverse, as they replace modeling with retrieval. However, they require users to translate spatial requirements to keywords, which paints an incomplete picture of physical artifacts: proportions or morphology are non-trivially encoded through text only. We explore a vision of in-situ spatial search for (future) physical artifacts, and present ShapeFindAR, a mixed-reality tool to search for 3D models using in-situ sketches blended with textual queries. With ShapeFindAR, users search for geometry, and not necessarily precise labels, while coupling the search process to the physical environment (e.g., by sketching in-situ, extracting search terms from objects present, or tracing them). We developed ShapeFindAR for HoloLens 2, connected to a database of 3D-printable artifacts. We specify in-situ spatial search, describe its advantages, and present walkthroughs using ShapeFindAR, which highlight novel ways for users to articulate their wishes, without requiring complex modeling tools or profound domain knowledge.

High-fidelity driving simulators can act as testbeds for designing in-vehicle interfaces or validating the safety of novel driver assistance features. In this system paper, we develop and validate the safety of a mixed reality driving simulator system that enables us to superimpose virtual objects and events into the view of participants engaging in real-world driving in unmodified vehicles. To this end, we have validated the mixed reality system for basic driver cockpit and low-speed driving tasks, comparing the use of the system with non-headset and with the headset driving conditions, to ensure that participants behave and perform similarly using this system as they would otherwise. This paper outlines the operational procedures and protocols for using such systems for cockpit tasks (like using the parking brake, reading the instrument panel, and turn signaling) as well as basic low-speed driving exercises (such as steering around corners, weaving around obstacles, and stopping at a fixed line) in ways that are safe, effective, and lead to accurate, repeatable data collection about behavioral responses in real-world driving tasks.

Learnability is a core aspect of software usability. Video games are not an exception, as game designers need to teach players how to play their creations. We analyzed 40 contemporary video games to identify how video games approach learning experiences. We found that games have advanced far beyond using simple tutorials or demonstration screens and adopt a range of repeatable and reusable design strategies using visual cues to facilitate learning. We provide a detailed descriptive framework of these design strategies, elucidating how and when they can be used, and describing how the visual cues are used to build them. Our research can be useful for both general HCI researchers and practitioners seeking to tap into the rich ideas from video game learnability design looking for practical solutions for their work.

Accessibility for color vision deficiencies: Challenges and findings of a large scale study on paper figures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502133,6,https://scholar.archive.org/work/6ye6dydkrnfftntlfx3u33yyui/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502133,"
We present an exploratory study on the accessibility of images in publications when viewed with color vision deficiencies (CVDs). The study is based on 1,710 images sampled from a visualization dataset (VIS30K) over five years. We simulated four CVDs on each image. First, four researchers (one with a CVD) identified existing issues and helpful aspects in a subset of the images. Based on the resulting labels, 200 crowdworkers provided  30,000 ratings on present CVD issues in the simulated images. We analyzed this data for correlations, clusters, trends, and free text comments to gain a first overview of paper figure accessibility. Overall, about 60 % of the images were rated accessible. Furthermore, our study indicates that accessibility issues are subjective and hard to detect. On a meta-level, we reflect on our study experience to point out challenges and opportunities of large-scale accessibility studies for future research directions.

Supporting the Design of Smart Speakers to Foster a Sense of Ownership in Asian Indian Families,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517680,5,https://scholar.archive.org/work/quqgvq633jbwxp7gxom3mqk4ue/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517680,"
 Smart speakers are increasingly being adopted by families in the U.S. In many cases, a smart speaker is shared by family members, which might make the sense of ownership uncertain. Through a diary and interview-based study with 20 Asian Indian parents and teenagers living in the U.S., this study through thematic analysis highlights various aspects of smart speakers that support or hinder the fulfilment of the psychological needs – self-efficacy, self-identity, territoriality, autonomy, and accountability and responsibility – that foster a sense of ownership. The paper also discusses the experiences of a cultural group that is not well represented in prior HCI work, and thus, it will add useful nuances and knowledge about inclusivity to the study of smart-speaker technology in HCI. Finally, it contributes six actionable design guidelines, including guidelines that relate to maintaining conversational context across different interactions and fostering a sense of ownership among users who share smart speakers, through the use of territorial markers.

Cardiac Arrest: Evaluating the Role of Biosignals in Gameplay Strategies and Players' Physiological Synchrony in Social Deception Games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519670,2,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146255/3491101.3519670.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
 Social deduction or deception games are games in which a player or team of players actively deceives other players who are trying to discover hidden roles as a part of the win condition. Included in this category are games like One Night Werewolf, Avalon, and Mafia. In this pilot study (N=24), we examined how the addition of visual displays of heart rate (HR) signals affected players’ gameplay in a six-player version of Mafia in online and in-person settings. We also examined moments of synchrony in HR data during critical moments of gameplay. We find that seeing signals did affect players’ strategies and influenced their gameplay, and that there were moments of HR synchrony during vital game events. These results suggest that HR, when available, is used by players in making game decisions, and that players’ HR can be a measure of like-minded player decisions. Future work can explore how other biosignals are utilized by players of social deception games, and how those signals may undergo unconscious synchrony.

Promptiverse: Scalable generation of scaffolding prompts through human-AI hybrid knowledge graph annotation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502087,7,https://johnr0.github.io/assets/publications/CHI2022-Promptiverse.pdf,"
 Online learners are hugely diverse with varying prior knowledge, but most instructional videos online are created to be one-size-fits-all. Thus, learners may struggle to understand the content by only watching the videos. Providing scaffolding prompts can help learners overcome these struggles through questions and hints that relate different concepts in the videos and elicit meaningful learning. However, serving diverse learners would require a spectrum of scaffolding prompts, which incurs high authoring effort. In this work, we introduce Promptiverse, an approach for generating diverse, multi-turn scaffolding prompts at scale, powered by numerous traversal paths over knowledge graphs. To facilitate the construction of the knowledge graphs, we propose a hybrid human-AI annotation tool, Grannotate. In our study (N=24), participants produced 40 times more on-par quality prompts with higher diversity, through Promptiverse and Grannotate, compared to hand-designed prompts. Promptiverse presents a model for creating diverse and adaptive learning experiences online.

Gamification strategies to improve the motivation and performance in accessibility information collection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519783,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/564yllcwdnfxxkdgleu3ucxlo4/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519783,"
 The high cost of dispatching professionals to physically audit locations limits the coverage of accessibility maps. Vision-based techniques and crowdsourcing using streetscape imagery are beneficial as they do not entail physical visits by people to actual locations. However, they exhibit limitations such as outdated photos and occlusions. In-the-field crowdsourcing enables physical collection of accessibility information at a low cost. The effectiveness of this technique is contingent on people with free time and high motivation to visit actual locations. In this paper, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform for constructing accessibility maps that support people with diverse free times and motivations. A combination of field auditing and field sensing, coupled with including and excluding gamification is explored. Game types are determined based on the characteristics of field auditing and field sensing. The experimental results confirm that gamification improves the motivation levels and performance of participants in certain aspects of crowdsourced field auditing and crowdsourced field sensing. Furthermore, the results indicate that item collection games have a greater impact on the motivation for taking unusual roads to collect accessibility information than continuous walking games.

 We present Print-A-Sketch, an open-source handheld printer prototype for sketching circuits and sensors. Print-A-Sketch combines desirable properties from free-hand sketching and functional electronic printing. Manual human control of large strokes is augmented with computer control of fine detail. Shared control of Print-A-Sketch supports sketching interactive interfaces on everyday objects – including many objects with materials or sizes which otherwise are difficult to print on. We present an overview of challenges involved in such a system and show how these can be addressed using context-aware, dynamic printing. Continuous sensing ensures quality prints by adjusting inking-rate to hand movement and material properties. Continuous sensing also enables the print to adapt to previously printed traces to support incremental and iterative sketching. Results show good conductivity on many materials and high spatial precision, supporting on-the-fly creation of functional interfaces.

Close-up and whispering: an understanding of multimodal and parasocial interactions in YouTube ASMR videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517563,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06839,"
 ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) has grown to immense popularity on YouTube and drawn HCI designers’ attention to its effects and applications in design. YouTube ASMR creators incorporate visual elements, sounds, motifs of touching and tasting, and other scenarios in multisensory video interactions to deliver enjoyable and relaxing experiences to their viewers. ASMRtists engage viewers by social, physical, and task attractions. Research has identified the benefits of ASMR in mental wellbeing. However, ASMR remains an understudied phenomenon in the HCI community, constraining designers’ ability to incorporate ASMR in video-based designs. This work annotates and analyzes the interaction modalities and parasocial attractions of 2663 videos to identify unique experiences. YouTube comment sections are also analyzed to compare viewers’ responses to different ASMR interactions. We find that ASMR videos are experiences of multimodal social connection, relaxing physical intimacy, and sensory-rich activity observation. Design implications are discussed to foster future ASMR-augmented video interactions.

User perceptions of extraversion in chatbots after repeated use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502058,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sven-Mayer/publication/360331099_User_Perceptions_of_Extraversion_in_Chatbots_after_Repeated_Use/links/629cd932416ec50bdb0e0bbf/User-Perceptions-of-Extraversion-in-Chatbots-after-Repeated-Use.pdf,"
Whilst imbuing robots and voice assistants with personality has been found to positively impact user experience, little is known about user perceptions of personality in purely text-based chatbots. In a within-subjects study, we asked N=34 participants to interact with three chatbots with different levels of Extraversion (extraverted, average, introverted), each over the course of four days. We systematically varied the chatbots’ responses to manipulate Extraversion based on work in the psycholinguistics of human behaviour. Our results show that participants perceived the extraverted and average chatbots as such, whereas verbal cues transferred from human behaviour were insufficient to create an introverted chatbot. Whilst most participants preferred interacting with the extraverted chatbot, participants engaged significantly more with the introverted chatbot as indicated by the users’ average number of written words. We discuss implications for researchers and practitioners on how to design chatbot personalities that can adapt to user preferences.

 While a significant part of communication in the workplace is now happening online, current platforms don’t fully support socio-cognitive nonverbal communication, which hampers the shared understanding and creativity of virtual teams. Given text-based communication being the main channel for virtual collaboration, we propose a novel solution leveraging an AI-based, dynamic affective recognition system. The app provides live feedback about the affective content of the communication in Slack, in the form of a visual representation and percentage breakdown of the ‘sentiment’ (tone, emoji) and main ‘emotion states’ (e.g. joy, anger). We tested the usability of the app in a quasi-experiment with 30 participants from diverse backgrounds, linguistic analysis and user interviews. The findings show that the app significantly increases shared understanding and creativity within virtual teams. Emerged themes included impression formation assisted by affective recognition, supporting long-term relationships development; identified challenges related to transparency and emotional complexity detected by AI.

 Using voice commands to automate smartphone tasks (e.g., making a video call) can effectively augment the interactivity of numerous mobile apps. However, creating voice command interfaces requires a tremendous amount of effort in labeling and compiling the graphical user interface (GUI) and the utterance data. In this paper, we propose AutoVCI, a novel approach to automatically generate voice command interface (VCI) from smartphone operation sequences. The generated voice command interface has two distinct features. First, it automatically maps a voice command to GUI operations and fills in parameters accordingly, leveraging the GUI data instead of corpus or hand-written rules. Second, it launches a complementary Q&A dialogue to confirm the intention in case of ambiguity. In addition, the generated voice command interface can learn and evolve from user interactions. It accumulates the history command understanding results to annotate the user’s input and improve its semantic understanding ability. We implemented this approach on Android devices and conducted a two-phase user study with 16 and 67 participants in each phase. Experimental results of the study demonstrated the practical feasibility of AutoVCI.

There is no first-or third-person view in virtual reality: Understanding the perspective continuum,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517447,6,https://3dvar.com/Hoppe2022There.pdf,"
 Modern games make creative use of First- and Third-person perspectives (FPP and TPP) to allow the player to explore virtual worlds. Traditionally, FPP and TPP perspectives are seen as distinct concepts. Yet, Virtual Reality (VR) allows for flexibility in choosing perspectives. We introduce the notion of a perspective continuum in VR, which is technically related to the camera position and conceptually to how users perceive their environment in VR. A perspective continuum enables adapting and manipulating the sense of agency and involvement in the virtual world. This flexibility of perspectives broadens the design space of VR experiences through deliberately manipulating perception. In a study, we explore users’ attitudes, experiences and perceptions while controlling a virtual character from the two known perspectives. Statistical analysis of the empirical results shows the existence of a perspective continuum in VR. Our findings can be used to design experiences based on shifts of perception.

Optimizing the use of the sentence completion survey technique in user research: a case study on the experience of e-reading,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517718,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517718,"
Sentence completion, originally a semi-projective psychological technique, has been used as an effective and lightweight user research method in UX design. More information is yet still needed to understand how different sentence stems probe users’ insights, thereby providing recommendations for effective sentence completion surveys. We used the completion method on a large-scale sample to explore (e-)readers’ experiences and needs. Depending on their reading habits, participants (N=1880) were asked to complete a set of sentences, as part of a web survey. With 14143 user ideas collected in two weeks, our results confirm that remote online sentence completion is a cost-effective data collection method able to uncover feelings, attitudes, motivations, needs, or frustrations. Variation in sentence stems affected collected data in terms of item response rate, idea quantity as well as variety and originality. Building on previous research, this paper delivers actionable insights to optimize the richness of sentence completion outputs.

 Data Videos (DVs), or animated infographics that tell stories with data, are becoming increasingly popular. Despite their potential to induce attitude change, little is explored about how to produce effective DVs. This paper describes two studies that explored factors linked to the potential of health DVs to improve viewers’ behavioural change intentions. We investigated: 1) how viewers’ affect is linked to their behavioural change intentions; 2) how these affect are linked to the viewers’ personality traits; 3) which attributes of DVs are linked to their persuasive potential. Results from both studies indicated that viewers’ negative affect lowered their behavioural change intentions. Individuals with higher neuroticism exhibited higher negative affect and were harder to convince. Finally, Study 2 proved that providing any solutions to the health problem, presented in the DV, made the viewers perceive the videos as more actionable while lowering their negative affect, and importantly, induced higher behavioural change intentions.

Haptic fidelity framework: Defining the factors of realistic haptic feedback for virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501953,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501953,"
 Providing haptic feedback in virtual reality to make the experience more realistic has become a strong focus of research in recent years. The resulting haptic feedback systems differ greatly in their technologies, feedback possibilities, and overall realism making it challenging to compare different systems. We propose the Haptic Fidelity Framework providing the means to describe, understand and compare haptic feedback systems. The framework locates a system in the spectrum of providing realistic or abstract haptic feedback using the Haptic Fidelity dimension. It comprises 14 criteria that either describe foundational or limiting factors. A second Versatility dimension captures the current trade-off between highly realistic but application-specific and more abstract but widely applicable feedback. To validate the framework, we compared the Haptic Fidelity score to the perceived feedback realism of evaluations from 38 papers and found a strong correlation suggesting the framework accurately describes the realism of haptic feedback.

 To acquire language, children need rich language input. However, many parents find it difficult to provide children with sufficient language input, which risks delaying their language development. To aid these parents, we design Captivate!, the first system that provides contextual language guidance to parents during play. Our system tracks both visual and spoken language cues to infer targets of joint attention, enabling the real-time suggestion of situation-relevant phrases for the parent. We design our system through a user-centered process with immigrant families—a highly vulnerable yet understudied population—as well as professional speech language therapists. Next, we evaluate Captivate! on parents with children aged 1–3 to observe improvements in responsive language use. We share insights into developing contextual guidance technology for linguistically diverse families1.

This preliminary study explores the financial practices of older Hong Kong immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area through semi-structured interviews with 10 participants. First, this study examines the impact of social networks in settlement patterns and financial decisions such as choosing banks. Secondly, this study looks at the variety of ways people use and track money, including the adoption of digital banking and contexts of cash use. Finally, a comparison between banking practices in Hong Kong and the Greater Toronto Area is explored. These narratives reveal how social capital, trust, geography and community influence financial habits from managing transnational bank accounts to navigating technological advancements. The diversity of financial practices revealed here highlights the importance of avoiding broad categorizations of older adults and immigrants, and instead contextualizing Fintech design within communities and cultural practices.

Splash! identifying the grand challenges for waterhci,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503723,2,https://exertiongameslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/splash_chi2022.pdf,"
 Bodies of water can be a hostile environment for both humans and technology, yet they are increasingly becoming sources, sites and media of interaction across a range of academic and practical disciplines. Despite the increasing number of interactive systems that can be used in-, on-, and underwater, there does not seem to be a coherent approach or understanding of how HCI can or should engage with water. This workshop will explicitly address the challenges of designing interactive aquatic systems with the aim of articulating the grand challenges faced by WaterHCI. We will first map user experiences around water based on participants’ personal experiences with water and interactive technology. Building on those experiences, we then discuss specific challenges when designing interactive aquatic experiences. This includes considerations such as safety, accessibility, the environment and well-being. In doing so, participants will help shape future work in WaterHCI.

Paracentral and near-peripheral visualizations: Towards attention-maintaining secondary information presentation on OHMDs during in-person social interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502127,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502127,"
Optical see-through Head-Mounted Displays (OST HMDs, OHMDs) are known to facilitate situational awareness while accessing secondary information. However, information displayed on OHMDs can cause attention shifts, which distract users from natural social interactions. We hypothesize that information displayed in paracentral and near-peripheral vision can be better perceived while the user is maintaining eye contact during face-to-face conversations. Leveraging this idea, we designed a circular progress bar to provide progress updates in paracentral and near-peripheral vision. We compared it with textual and linear progress bars under two conversation settings: a simulated one with a digital conversation partner and a realistic one with a real partner. Results show that a circular progress bar can effectively reduce notification distractions without losing eye contact and is more preferred by users. Our findings highlight the potential of utilizing the paracentral and near-peripheral vision for secondary information presentation on OHMDs.

For what it's worth: Humans overwrite their economic self-interest to avoid bargaining with AI systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517734,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517734,"
 As algorithms are increasingly augmenting and substituting human decision-making, understanding how the introduction of computational agents changes the fundamentals of human behavior becomes vital. This pertains to not only users, but also those parties who face the consequences of an algorithmic decision. In a controlled experiment with 480 participants, we exploit an extended version of two-player ultimatum bargaining where responders choose to bargain with either another human, another human with an AI decision aid or an autonomous AI-system acting on behalf of a passive human proposer. Our results show strong responder preferences against the algorithm, as most responders opt for a human opponent and demand higher compensation to reach a contract with autonomous agents. To map these preferences to economic expectations, we elicit incentivized subject beliefs about their opponent’s behavior. The majority of responders maximize their expected value when this is line with approaching the human proposer. In contrast, responders predicting income maximization for the autonomous AI-system overwhelmingly override economic self-interest to avoid the algorithm.

 Digital interfaces are shrinking, driven by pressures of mass production and consumer culture, and often accompanied by a discourse of control, precision or convenience. Meanwhile, human bodies remain the same size, and the changing size of interfaces has implications for the formation of user identities. Drawing on embodied cognition, effort and entanglement theories of HCI, we explored the impact of interface size on the co-constitution of humans and technology. We designed an oversized digital musical instrument and invited musicians to use the instrument to create original performances. We found that both the performances and the musicians’ self-perception were influenced by the large size of the instrument, shining new light on the ways in which designing technology is designing humans and in turn culture.

A complex human-machine coordination problem: essential constraints on interaction control in bionic communication systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519672,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519672,"
Novel voice enhancements for larynx amputees utilize a variety of wearable interfaces and/or artificial intelligence. However, the problem formulation remains posed as “voice restoration”, which stems from common, but limiting, assumptions about communication as a reliable signal transfer, in which “signal” equals to voice. Yet beyond this signal transfer, the vital part of communication is mutual influence. During conversations people coordinate their movement dynamics, i.e. adjust speech timing, intonation and gestures. By taking this perspective, informed by the newest trends in the cognitive sciences (ecological, enacted, extended cognition) as well as recent studies on human-machine integration, we seek to shed new light on the processes of analysis and evaluation of specific systems for laryngectomees. We propose the integrated framework which enables us to interpret bionic communicative interfaces as parts of distributed cognitive systems that allow for different level of control over interactions. This paper analyses 5 bionic systems, consisting of a laryngectomee supported with i) voice copy, ii) voice conversion, iii) silent speech iv) bionic voice or v) lean-AI interfaces. We demonstrate how using the broader perspective leads to noticing important aspects of communication and informs a more human-centered design and evaluation.

OtherTube: Facilitating Content Discovery and Reflection by Exchanging YouTube Recommendations with Strangers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502028,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502028,"
 To promote engagement, recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube increasingly personalize users’ feeds, limiting users’ exposure to diverse content and depriving them of opportunities to reflect on their interests compared to others’. In this work, we investigate how exchanging recommendations with strangers can help users discover new content and reflect. We tested this idea by developing OtherTube—a browser extension for YouTube that displays strangers’ personalized YouTube recommendations. OtherTube allows users to (i) create an anonymized profile for social comparison, (ii) share their recommended videos with others, and (iii) browse strangers’ YouTube recommendations. We conducted a 10-day-long user study (n = 41) followed by a post-study interview (n = 11). Our results reveal that users discovered and developed new interests from seeing OtherTube recommendations. We identified user and content characteristics that affect interaction and engagement with exchanged recommendations; for example, younger users interacted more with OtherTube, while the perceived irrelevance of some content discouraged users from watching certain videos. Users reflected on their interests as well as others’, recognizing similarities and differences. Our work shows promise for designs leveraging the exchange of personalized recommendations with strangers.

The Candy Workshop: Supporting Rich Sensory Modalities in Constructive Data Physicalization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519648,2,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/50536/2/3491101.3519648.pdf,"
Constructive data physicalization (i.e. the creation of visualizations by non-experts using physical elements) is a promising research area in a context of rapid democratization of data collection and visualization, driven notably by the quantified-self movement. Despite a prolific body of work developed to explore physicalization as a mean to communicate data to individuals, little is known about how people transform data into physical artefacts. Current research also falls short in studying constructive physicalizations using other sensory modalities than sight or touch. Building on the principles of data edibilization, we propose to use candies as a medium to study constructive data physicalization processes, due to their ability to leverage multiple sensory channels. We conducted a preliminary study (candy workshop) to gain insights into how people make use of various sensory modalities in the construction of data physicalizations. We hope to inspire new research using candies as accessible research material.

i-LaTeX: Manipulating Transitional Representations between LaTeX Code and Generated Documents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517494,6,https://hal.science/hal-03659326/document,"
 Document description languages such as LaTeX are used extensively to author scientific and technical documents, but editing them is cumbersome: code-based editors only provide generic features, while WYSIWYG interfaces only support a subset of the language. Our interviews with 11 LaTeX users highlighted their difficulties dealing with textually-encoded abstractions and with the mappings between source code and document output. To address some of these issues, we introduce Transitional Representations for document description languages, which enable the visualisation and manipulation of fragments of code in relation to their generated output. We present i-LaTeX, a LaTeX editor equipped with Transitional Representations of formulae, tables, images, and grid layouts. A 16-participant experiment shows that Transitional Representations let them complete common editing tasks significantly faster, with fewer compilations, and with a lower workload. We discuss how Transitional Representations affect editing strategies and conclude with directions for future work.

The impact of motion scaling and haptic guidance on operators' workload and performance in teleoperation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519814,2,,"
 The use of human operator managed robotics, especially for safety critical work, includes a shift from physically demanding to mentally challenging work, and new techniques for Human-Robot Interaction are being developed to make teleoperation easier and more accurate. This study evaluates the impact of combining two teleoperation support features (i) scaling the velocity mapping of leader-follower arms (motion scaling), and (ii) haptic-feedback guided shared control (haptic guidance). We used purposely difficult peg-in-the-hole tasks requiring high precision insertion and manipulation, and obstacle avoidance, and evaluated the impact of using individual and combined support features on a) task performance and b) operator workload. As expected, long distance tasks led to higher mental workload and lower performance than short distance tasks. Our results showed that motion scaling and haptic guidance impact workload and improve performance during more difficult tasks, and we discussed this in contrast to participants preference for using different teleoperation features.

“Ask yourself WHY you want to track yourself”: Co-Designing a Self-Tracking Guide with Teenagers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519650,2,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:a539264a-cad4-4059-9e20-d49fdf9859f3/download_file?file_format=&safe_filename=Freeman_Curtis_2022_ask_yourself_why.pdf&type_of_work=Conference+item,"
Teenagers often engage with Personal Informatics tools for health and fitness without support or guidance specific to their individual experiences. There is a lack of research on how putting teens at the center of designing educational resources might empower young users to harness the affordances of self-tracking tools that are of most value to them. To address this gap, we ran five online co-design workshops with 44 teenagers (aged 13-18 years) in the United Kingdom to design a self-tracking guide for teens. We focused on content, presentation of information, and distribution strategy. Our findings highlight the complexity of creating resources which adeptly capture the needs of this diverse user group. To successfully build interactive educational resources appropriate for teens’ positive engagement with health-related self-tracking tools, designers and researchers must prioritize teen-centered design with a focus on: (1) teens’ core reasons for self-tracking and (2) opportunities for social support and community-building.

Dynamic robotic fibers: Liquid crystal elastomers for programmable and reversible shape-changing behaviors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519769,2,https://research.tue.nl/files/203670467/3491101.3519769.pdf,"
This work aims to provide early-stage insights into an electro-thermally actuated liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) fiber for novel shape-changing behaviors that are both programmable and reversible. We build a control system and experimentally investigate the electro-thermal characteristics and actuation, identifying four categories of fiber behavior: Oscillating Tip, Oscillating Fiber, Tilting and Bending. These key parameters illustrate the broad application potential of the proposed approach within a functional, communication and expressive context. Our contributions are threefold a.) the control of an electro-thermal responsive LCE fiber, b.) directions for soft robotic device integration c.) early-stage insights into fiber shape-changing behaviors towards application.

"Interrupting merit, subverting legibility: Navigating caste in 'casteless' worlds of computing",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502059,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502059,"
Recent work in HCI has shed light on structural issues of inequality in computing. Building on this work, this study analyzes the relatively understudied phenomenon of caste in computing. Contrary to common rhetorics of ‘castelessness,’ we show how computing worlds in India and Indian diasporic communities continue to be shaped and inflected by caste relations. We study how, when and where Dalits (formerly ‘untouchables’) encounter caste in computing. We show how they artfully navigate these caste inscriptions by interpreting, interrupting and ambiguating caste and by finding caste communities. Drawing on the life stories of 16 Dalit engineers and anti-caste, queer-feminist and critical race theories, we argue that a dynamic and performative approach to caste, and other forms of inequality in HCI and computing, emphasizes the artfulness and agency of those at the margins as they challenge structural inequality in everyday life. Lastly, we suggest practical ways of addressing caste to build more open and inclusive cultures of global computing.

Visualizing instructions for physical training: Exploring visual cues to support movement learning from instructional videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517735,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517735,"
Instructional videos for physical training have gained popularity in recent years among sport and fitness practitioners, due to the proliferation of affordable and ubiquitous forms of online training. Yet, learning movement this way poses challenges: lack of feedback and personalised instructions, and having to rely on personal imitation capacity to learn movements. We address some of these challenges by exploring visual cues’ potential to help people imitate movements from instructional videos. With a Research through Design approach, focused on strength training, we augmented an instructional video with different sets of visual cues: directional cues, body highlights, and metaphorical visualizations. We tested each set with ten practitioners over three recorded sessions, with follow-up interviews. Through thematic analysis, we derived insights on the effect of each set of cues for supporting movement learning. Finally, we generated design takeaways to inform future HCI work on visual cues for instructional training videos.

 Our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners across disciplines in HCI who share an interest in promoting well-being through tangible interaction. The workshop forms an impassioned response to the worldwide push towards more digital and remote interaction in nearly all domains of our lives in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. One question we raise is: to what extent will measures like remote interaction remain in place post-pandemic, and to what extent these changes may influence future agendas for the design of interactive products and services to support living well? We aim to ensure that the workshop serves as a space for diverse participants to share ideas and engage in cooperative discussions through hands-on activities resulting in the co-creation of a Manifesto to demonstrate the importance of embodied and sensory interaction for supporting well-being in a post-pandemic context. All the workshop materials will be published online on the workshop website and disseminated through ongoing collaboration.

Wizard of Errors: Introducing and Evaluating Machine Learning Errors in Wizard of Oz Studies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519684,2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08799,"
 When designing Machine Learning (ML) enabled solutions, designers often need to simulate ML behavior through the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) approach to test the user experience before the ML model is available. Although reproducing ML errors is essential for having a good representation, they are rarely considered. We introduce Wizard of Errors (WoE), a tool for conducting WoZ studies on ML-enabled solutions that allows simulating ML errors during user experience assessment. We explored how this system can be used to simulate the behavior of a computer vision model. We tested WoE with design students to determine the importance of considering ML errors in design, the relevance of using descriptive error types instead of confusion matrix, and the suitability of manual error control in WoZ studies. Our work identifies several challenges, which prevent realistic error representation by designers in such studies. We discuss the implications of these findings for design.

VisualBubble: Exploring how reflection-oriented user experiences affect users' awareness of their exposure to misinformation on social media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519615,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/98331761/3491101.pdf,"
Current solutions addressing misinformation on social media appear to rely on the misconception that misinformation is predominately spread by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the proliferation of false news is mainly due to humans. Solutions to curb misinformation should therefore emphasize human behavioral interventions, rather than focus solely on curbing AI bots. In this study, we analyze social media users’ behaviors by means of a user journey. We create VisualBubble, a design probe that encourages reflection-oriented user experiences during news consumption on social media. We test our design probe with 10 users, to determine its effectiveness in increasing users’ critical reflection on their news consumption behaviors. The initial findings show that VisualBubble can contribute to more critical attitudes towards the news that users are exposed to and, therefore, has the potential to mitigate social media misinformation.

Standing out among the daily spam: How to catch website owners' attention by means of vulnerability notifications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519847,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519847,"
 Running a business without having a website is nearly impossible nowadays. Most business owners use content managements systems to manage their websites. Yet, those can pose security risks and provide vulnerabilities for manipulations. With vulnerability notifications, website owners are notified about security risks. To identify common themes with respect to vulnerability notifications and provide deeper insight into the motivations of website owners to react to those notifications, we conducted 25 semi-structured interviews. In compliance with previous research, we could confirm that distrust in unexpected notifications is high and, in contrast to previous research, we suggest that verification possibilities are the most important factors to establish trust in notifications. We also endorse the findings that raising awareness for the severity and the complexity of the problems is crucial to increase remediation rates.

Sensitive Pictures: Emotional Interpretation in the Museum,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502080,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01041,"
Museums are interested in designing emotional visitor experiences to complement traditional interpretations. HCI is interested in the relationship between Affective Computing and Affective Interaction. We describe Sensitive Pictures, an emotional visitor experience co-created with the Munch art museum. Visitors choose emotions, locate associated paintings in the museum, experience an emotional story while viewing them, and self-report their response. A subsequent interview with a portrayal of the artist employs computer vision to estimate emotional responses from facial expressions. Visitors are given a souvenir postcard visualizing their emotional data. A study of 132 members of the public (39 interviewed) illuminates key themes: designing emotional provocations; capturing emotional responses; engaging visitors with their data; a tendency for them to align their views with the system's interpretation; and integrating these elements into emotional trajectories. We consider how Affective Computing can hold up a mirror to our emotions during Affective Interaction

Rethinking Menstrual Trackers Towards Period-Positive Ecologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517662,10,https://anupriyatuli.github.io/publications/2022_CHI.pdf,"
 Menstrual tracking is a mechanism widely engaged towards preserving menstrual dignity, as natural birth control, for ensuring adequate preparation for an upcoming cycle, among other motivations. We investigate the design of digital menstrual trackers towards enabling period-positive ecologies in otherwise stigmatized contexts. We examine menstrual tracking practices across ages (12–65 yrs.) using a combination of methods—3 surveys (450+ responses), a cultural probe (10 adolescents), interviews (16 adults), and a review of (9) mobile applications. Our analysis highlights the diversity across menstrual tracking practices and the role of relationships in influencing these practices throughout the menstrual journey. We also identify menstrual tracking as an avenue towards the emancipation of those who menstruate. Finally, we draw on Martha Nussbaum’s central human capabilities to discuss sociotechnical implications for redesigning digital menstrual trackers towards crafting just and period-positive futures.

A Model Predictive Control Approach for Reach Redirection in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501907,4,https://shape.stanford.edu/research/modelPredictiveControl/modelPredictiveControl.pdf,"
 Reach redirection is an illusion-based virtual reality (VR) interaction technique where a user’s virtual hand is shifted during a reach in order to guide their real hand to a physical location. Prior works have not considered the underlying sensorimotor processes driving redirection. In this work, we propose adapting a sensorimotor model for goal-directed reach to obtain a model for visually-redirected reach, specifically by incorporating redirection as a sensory bias in the state estimate used by a minimum jerk motion controller. We validate and then leverage this model to develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach for reach redirection, enabling the real-time generation of spatial warping according to desired optimization criteria (e.g., redirection goals) and constraints (e.g., sensory thresholds). We illustrate this approach with two example criteria – redirection to a desired point and redirection along a desired path – and compare our approach against existing techniques in a user evaluation.

Sound zones enable multiple simultaneous sound experiences in the same physical room without interference. In this paper, we present an interactive sound zone setup that can produce two sound zones within a confined space. Through a tangible remote controller, users can change the volume, size, and position of these sound zones. In addition, we have built a custom visualisation display that provides real-time feedback of the sound zones to support users’ understanding. Sound zone systems pose novel challenges for the HCI community, including how users may understand and interact with sound zones. Our setup offers a concrete solution into investigating these challenges.

3D Printed Street Crossings: Supporting Orientation and Mobility Training with People who are Blind or have Low Vision,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502072,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502072,"
 The ability to cross the street at intersections is an essential skill, often taught to people who are blind or have low vision (BLV) with the aid of tactile maps and kits or toys. However, each of the existing mapping tools has shortcomings. We investigated whether co-designed 3D printed components can offer benefits. Guided by consultation with 11 Orientation and Mobility (O&M) professionals, we co-designed a series of 3D printed kits that they then used in their practice with BLV children who showed high levels of engagement and learning. The 3D materials were found to demonstrate the key concepts for street crossings in a portable, engaging and professional manner. They will be released for free download, enabling O&M professionals to access or modify the materials as required. We hope that use of our co-designed 3D printed tools will contribute to the safety, independence and inclusion of BLV people.

Women’s economic empowerment is central to gender equality. However, work opportunities available to low-income women in patriarchal societies are infrequent. While crowd work has the potential to increase labor participation of such women, much remains unknown about their engagement with crowd work and the resultant opportunities and tensions. To fill this gap, we critically examined the adoption and use of a crowd work platform by low-income women in India. Through a qualitative study, we found that women faced tremendous challenges, for example, in seeking permission from family members to do crowd work, lack of family support and encouragement, and often working in unfavorable environments where they had to hide their work lives. While crowd work took a toll on their physical and emotional wellbeing, it also led to increased confidence, agency, and autonomy. We discuss ways to reduce frictions and tensions in participation of low-income women on crowd work platforms.

Dually noted: layout-aware annotations with smartphone augmented reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502026,5,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10350078,"
 Sharing annotations encourages feedback, discussion, and knowledge passing among readers and can be beneficial for personal and public use. Prior augmented reality (AR) systems have expanded these benefits to both digital and printed documents. However, despite smartphone AR now being widely available, there is a lack of research about how to use AR effectively for interactive document annotation. We propose Dually Noted, a smartphone-based AR annotation system that recognizes the layout of structural elements in a printed document for real-time authoring and viewing of annotations. We conducted experience prototyping with eight users to elicit potential benefits and challenges within smartphone AR, and this informed the resulting Dually Noted system and annotation interactions with the document elements. AR annotation is often unwieldy, but during a 12-user empirical study our novel structural understanding component allows Dually Noted to improve precise highlighting and annotation interaction accuracy by 13%, increase interaction speed by 42%, and significantly lower cognitive load over a baseline method without document layout understanding. Qualitatively, participants commented that Dually Noted was a swift and portable annotation experience. Overall, our research provides new methods and insights for how to improve AR annotations for physical documents.

Understanding privacy switching behaviour on Twitter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517675,6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08935,"
Changing a Twitter account’s privacy setting between public and protected changes the visibility of past tweets. By inspecting the privacy setting of more than 100K Twitter users over 3 months, we noticed that over 40% of those users changed their privacy setting at least once with around 16% changing it over 5 times. This observation motivated us to explore the reasons why people switch their privacy settings. We studied these switching phenomena quantitatively by comparing the tweeting behaviour of users when public vs protected, and qualitatively using two follow-up surveys (n=100, n=324) to understand potential reasoning behind the observed behaviours. Our quantitative analysis shows that users who switch privacy settings mention others and share hashtags more when their setting is public. Our surveys highlighted that users turn protected to share personal content and regulate boundaries while they turn public to interact with others in ways the protected setting prevents.

Electrical head actuation: Enabling interactive systems to directly manipulate head orientation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501910,5,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qRMK8Q_TTvw-q_nbGq4-QNIdkd38Bdqa/view,"
We propose a novel interface concept in which interactive systems directly manipulate the user's head orientation. We implement this using electrical-muscle-stimulation (EMS) of the neck muscles, which turns the head around its yaw (left/right) and pitch (up/down) axis. As the first exploration of EMS for head actuation, we characterized which muscles can be robustly actuated. Second, we evaluated the accuracy of our system for actuating participants' head orientation towards static targets and trajectories. Third, we demonstrated how it enables interactions not possible before by building a range of applications, such as (1) synchronizing head orientations of two users, which enables a user to communicate head nods to another user while listening to music, and (2) directly changing the user's head orientation to locate objects in AR. Finally, in our second study, participants felt that our head actuation contributed positively to their experience in four distinct applications.

Letters from the Future: Exploring Ethical Dilemmas in the Design of Social Agents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517536,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517536,"
 We present a case-study of using Ethnographic Experiential Futures (EXF) to surface underlying divergences, tensions and dilemmas implicit in views of the futures of ”social agents” among professional researchers familiar with the state of the art. Based on expert interviews, we designed three ”letters from the future,” research probes that were mailed to 15 participants working in the field, to encounter and respond to. We lay out the elements and design choices that shaped these probes, present our remote and asynchronous study design, and discuss lessons learned about the use of EXF. We find that this form of hybrid design/futures intervention has the potential to provide professional communities with opportunities to grapple with potential ethical dilemmas early on. However, the knowledge and tools for doing so are still in the making. Our contribution is a step towards advancing the potential benefits of experiential futures for technology designers and researchers.

Understanding the digital lives of youth: Analyzing media shared within safe versus unsafe private conversations on Instagram,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501969,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501969,"
 We collected Instagram Direct Messages (DMs) from 100 adolescents and young adults (ages 13-21) who then flagged their own conversations as safe or unsafe. We performed a mixed-method analysis of the media files shared privately in these conversations to gain human-centered insights into the risky interactions experienced by youth. Unsafe conversations ranged from unwanted sexual solicitations to mental health related concerns, and images shared in unsafe conversations tended to be of people and convey negative emotions, while those shared in regular conversations more often conveyed positive emotions and contained objects. Further, unsafe conversations were significantly shorter, suggesting that youth disengaged when they felt unsafe. Our work uncovers salient characteristics of safe and unsafe media shared in private conversations and provides the foundation to develop automated systems for online risk detection and mitigation.

Understanding Multi-Device Usage Patterns: Physical Device Configurations and Fragmented Workflows,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517702,5,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10151146/1/Marquardt_Understanding%20Multi-Device%20Usage%20Patterns_AAM.pdf,"
 To better ground technical (systems) investigation and interaction design of cross-device experiences, we contribute an in-depth survey of existing multi-device practices, including fragmented workflows across devices and the way people physically organize and configure their workspaces to support such activity. Further, this survey documents a historically significant moment of transition to a new future of remote work, an existing trend dramatically accelerated by the abrupt switch to work-from-home (and having to contend with the demands of home-at-work) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 97 participants, and collected photographs of home setups and open-ended answers to 50 questions categorized in 5 themes. We characterize the wide range of multi-device physical configurations and identify five usage patterns, including: partitioning tasks, integrating multi-device usage, cloning tasks to other devices, expanding tasks and inputs to multiple devices, and migrating between devices. Our analysis also sheds light on the benefits and challenges people face when their workflow is fragmented across multiple devices. These insights have implications for the design of multi-device experiences that support people’s fragmented workflows.

Designing and evaluating a chatbot for survivors of image-based sexual abuse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517629,6,,"
 Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) is a severe social problem that causes survivors tremendous pain. IBSA survivors may encounter a lack of information and victim blame when seeking online and offline assistance. While institutions support survivors, they cannot be available 24 hours a day. Because the immediate reaction to IBSA is crucial to remove intimate images and prevent further distribution, survivors need first responders who are always accessible and do not blame them. Chatbots are constantly available, do not judge the conversation partner, and may deliver structured information and words of comfort. Therefore, we developed a chatbot to provide information and emotional support to IBSA survivors in dealing with their abuse. We analyzed nine chatbots for sexual violence survivors to identify common design elements. In addition, we sought advice from five professional counselors about the challenges survivors have while responding to their harm. We conducted a user study with 25 participants to determine the chatbot’s effectiveness in providing information and emotional support compared to internet search. The chatbot was better than the internet search regarding information organization, accessibility, and conciseness. Furthermore, the chatbot excels in providing emotional support to survivors. We discuss the survivor-centered information structure and design consideration of emotionally supportive conversation.

ReCompFig: Designing dynamically reconfigurable kinematic devices using compliant mechanisms and tensioning cables,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502065,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502065,"
From creating input devices to rendering tangible information, the field of HCI is interested in using kinematic mechanisms to create human-computer interfaces. Yet, due to fabrication and design challenges, it is often difficult to create kinematic devices that are compact and have multiple reconfigurable motional degrees of freedom (DOFs) depending on the interaction scenarios. In this work, we combine compliant mechanisms (CMs) with tensioning cables to create dynamically reconfigurable kinematic mechanisms. The devices’ kinematics (DOFs) is enabled and determined by the layout of bendable rods. The additional cables function as on-demand motion constraints that can dynamically lock or unlock the mechanism's DOFs as they are tightened or loosened. We provide algorithms and a design tool prototype to help users design such kinematic devices. We also demonstrate various HCI use cases including a kinematic haptic display, a haptic proxy, and a multimodal input device.

A Large-Scale Longitudinal Analysis of Missing Label Accessibility Failures in Android Apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502143,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502143,"
We present the first large-scale longitudinal analysis of missing label accessibility failures in Android apps. We developed a crawler and collected monthly snapshots of 312 apps over 16 months. We use this unique dataset in empirical examinations of accessibility not possible in prior datasets. Key large-scale findings include missing label failures in 55.6% of unique image-based elements, longitudinal improvement in ImageButton elements but not in more prevalent ImageView elements, that 8.8% of unique screens are unreachable without navigating at least one missing label failure, that app failure rate does not improve with number of downloads, and that effective labeling is neither limited to nor guaranteed by large software organizations. We then examine longitudinal data in individual apps, presenting illustrative examples of accessibility impacts of systematic improvements, incomplete improvements, interface redesigns, and accessibility regressions. We discuss these findings and potential opportunities for tools and practices to improve label-based accessibility.

Towards modeling of virtual reality welding simulators to promote accessible and scalable training,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517696,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3517696,"
 The US manufacturing industry is currently facing a welding workforce shortage which is largely due to inadequacy of widespread welding training. To address this challenge, we present a Virtual Reality (VR)-based training system aimed at transforming state-of-the-art-welding simulations and in-person instruction into a widely accessible and engaging platform. We applied backward design principles to design a low-cost welding simulator in the form of modularized units through active consulting with welding training experts. Using a minimum viable prototype, we conducted a user study with 24 novices to test the system’s usability. Our findings show (1) greater effectiveness of the system in transferring skills to real-world environments as compared to accessible video-based alternatives and, (2) the visuo-haptic guidance during virtual welding enhances performance and provides a realistic learning experience to users. Using the solution, we expect inexperienced users to achieve competencies faster and be better prepared to enter actual work environments.

GANSpiration: Balancing Targeted and Serendipitous Inspiration in User Interface Design with Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517511,6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03827,"
 Inspiration from design examples plays a crucial role in the creative process of user interface design. However, current tools and techniques that support inspiration usually only focus on example browsing with limited user control or similarity-based example retrieval, leading to undesirable design outcomes such as focus drift and design fixation. To address these issues, we propose the GANSpiration approach that suggests design examples for both targeted and serendipitous inspiration, leveraging a style-based Generative Adversarial Network. A quantitative evaluation revealed that the outputs of GANSpiration-based example suggestion approaches are relevant to the input design, and at the same time include diverse instances. A user study with professional UI/UX practitioners showed that the examples suggested by our approach serve as viable sources of inspiration for overall design concepts and specific design elements. Overall, our work paves the road of using advanced generative machine learning techniques in supporting the creative design practice.

Understanding challenges for developers to create accurate privacy nutrition labels,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502012,28,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502012,"
 Apple announced the introduction of app privacy details to their App Store in December 2020, marking the first ever real-world, large-scale deployment of the privacy nutrition label concept, which had been introduced by researchers over a decade earlier. The Apple labels are created by app developers, who self-report their app’s data practices. In this paper, we present the first study examining the usability and understandability of Apple’s privacy nutrition label creation process from the developer’s perspective. By observing and interviewing 12 iOS app developers about how they created the privacy label for a real-world app that they developed, we identified common challenges for correctly and efficiently creating privacy labels. We discuss design implications both for improving Apple’s privacy label design and for future deployment of other standardized privacy notices.

"Who, what, why and how? towards the monetary incentive in crowd collaboration: A case study of github's sponsor mechanism",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501822,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13323,"
 While many forms of financial support are currently available, there are still many complaints about inadequate financing from software maintainers. In May 2019, GitHub, the world’s most active social coding platform, launched the Sponsor mechanism as a step toward more deeply integrating open source development and financial support. This paper collects data on 8,028 maintainers, 13,555 sponsors, and 22,515 sponsorships and conducts a comprehensive analysis. We explore the relationship between the Sponsor mechanism and developers along four dimensions using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis, examining why developers participate, how the mechanism affects developer activity, who obtains more sponsorships, and what mechanism flaws developers have encountered in the process of using it. We find a long-tail effect in the act of sponsorship, with most maintainers’ expectations remaining unmet, and sponsorship has only a short-term, slightly positive impact on development activity but is not sustainable. While sponsors participate in this mechanism mainly as a means of thanking the developers of OSS that they use, in practice, the social status of developers is the primary influence on the number of sponsorships. We find that both the Sponsor mechanism and open source donations have certain shortcomings and need further improvements to attract more participants.

What are you Grateful for?-Enhancing Gratitude Routines by Using Speech Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519786,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519786,"
 This paper presents an extension for Amazon’s Alexa, which provides a gratitude journal, and investigates its effectiveness compared to a regular paper-based version. Decades of research demonstrate that expressing gratitude has various psychological and physical benefits. At the same time, gratitude routines run the risk of being a hassle activity, which diminishes the positive outcome. Speech assistants might help to integrate gratitude routines more easily in an intuitive way using voice input. The results of our 8-day field study with two experimental groups (Alexa group vs. Paper group, N = 8) show that users see the benefits, that Alexa was effective in reducing participants’ stress and that both groups express their gratitude differently. The positive effect of Alexa was restricted by a security setting (limiting user input to eight seconds) imposed by Amazon, which has now been repealed. The findings give practical and theoretical implications of how verbal gratitude expression affects participants’ well-being.

Cognitive Modelling: From GOMS to Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503771,2,,"
 This course introduces computational cognitive modeling for researchers and practitioners in the field of HCI. Cognitive models use computer programs to model how users perceive, think, and act in human–computer interaction. They offer a powerful approach for understanding interactive tasks and improving user interfaces. This course starts with a review of classic architecture based models such as GOMS and ACT-R. It then rapidly progresses to introducing modern modelling approaches powered by machine learning methods, in particular deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and deep RL. The course is built around hands-on Python programming using notebooks.

Ovrlap: Perceiving multiple locations simultaneously to improve interaction in vr,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501873,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501873,"
 We introduce OVRlap, a VR interaction technique that lets the user perceive multiple places at the same time from a first-person perspective. OVRlap achieves this by overlapping viewpoints. At any time, only one viewpoint is active, meaning that the user may interact with objects therein. Objects seen from the active viewpoint are opaque, whereas objects seen from passive viewpoints are transparent. This allows users to perceive multiple locations at once and easily switch to the one in which they want to interact. We compare OVRlap and a single-viewpoint technique in a study where 20 participants complete object-collection and monitoring tasks. We find that in both tasks, participants are significantly faster and move their head significantly less with OVRlap. We propose how the technique might be improved through automated switching of the active viewpoint and intelligent viewpoint rendering.

 We are all researchers, practitioners, and educators – but many of us are also artists, makers, curators. Our arts practice is part of what makes up our sense of self, but also influences our interests and directions in digital and technological enquiry. There exist spaces where the traditional lives alongside the computational, or where the two are blended, no less valid in purpose or value. We seek to investigate this liminal environment, and explore the current state of art in HCI, computer science and other related fields, shifting boundaries as to what ”art” is in these spaces. By bringing together like-minded and creative individuals, this workshop aims to both inspire and legitimise our diverse practices, present viewpoints, create meaningful outputs, host discussions, and work toward the future of this plurality.

TypeAnywhere: A QWERTY-Based Text Entry Solution for Ubiquitous Computing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517686,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517686,"
 We present a QWERTY-based text entry system, TypeAnywhere, for use in off-desktop computing environments. Using a wearable device that can detect finger taps, users can leverage their touch-typing skills from physical keyboards to perform text entry on any surface. TypeAnywhere decodes typing sequences based only on finger-tap sequences without relying on tap locations. To achieve optimal decoding performance, we trained a neural language model and achieved a 1.6% character error rate (CER) in an offline evaluation, compared to a 5.3% CER from a traditional n-gram language model. Our user study showed that participants achieved an average performance of 70.6 WPM, or 80.4% of their physical keyboard speed, and 1.50% CER after 2.5 hours of practice over five days on a table surface. They also achieved 43.9 WPM and 1.37% CER when typing on their laps. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of QWERTY typing as a ubiquitous text entry solution.

It is important to study how to help people quickly find misplaced objects. However, previous studies have focused on single-person scenarios without considering the influence of other people in public places. Based on the technology of object detection and face recognition, our system can help reduce the burden upon people's memory. It can provide useful information, whether the user forgets where the object is or because someone else has moved the object. The system includes a camera, processing server and smartphone application. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative user study with participants (n=12). We demonstrated the usability of this system in helping users find misplaced items in public settings with multiple people.

Exploring Renewable Energy Futures through Household Energy Resilience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517597,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517597,"
A transition to renewable energy increases the risks of disruptions when electricity supply does not meet demand. HCI has explored how digital technologies can mitigate such problems in households through support for reducing or shifting electricity use. However, faster transitions may be possible if some disturbances can be acceptable and households are supported in adapting to them. In this paper, we present a study of 21 Swedish households and their experiences of and ideas on how to manage disruptions in electricity supply. We call this perspective household energy resilience and identify three strategies for resilience: (1) response diversity, i.e., diversity in ways of carrying out normally electricity-dependent practices, (2) creating opportunities to develop resilience, and (3) building community energy resilience. Furthermore, we suggest how HCI can support these strategies, both by providing tools to increase resilience and by carefully designing technology and services to be more resilient in themselves.

AI beyond Deus Ex Machina–Reimagining Intelligence in Future Cities with Urban Experts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517502,5,https://arodes.hes-so.ch/record/10428/files/Mlynar_2022_AI_beyond_deus.pdf,"
The current mechanisms that drive the development of AI technologies are widely criticized for being tech-oriented and market-led instead of stemming from societal challenges. In Human-Centered AI discourses, and more broadly in Human-Computer Interaction research, initiatives have been proposed to engage experts from various domains of social science in determining how AI should reach our societies, predominantly through informing the adoption policies. Our contribution, however, seeks a more essential role for social sciences, namely to introduce discursive standpoints around what we need AI to be. With a focus on the domain of urbanism, the specific goal has been to elicit – from interviews with 16 urban experts – the imaginaries of how AI can and should impact future cities. Drawing on the social science literature, we present how the notion of “imaginary” has essentially framed this research and how it could reveal an alternative vision of non-human intelligent actors in future cities.

Keep it Short: A Comparison of Voice Assistants' Response Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517684,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517684,"
 Voice assistants (VAs) are present in homes, smartphones, and cars. They allow users to perform tasks without graphical or tactile user interfaces, as they are designed for natural language interaction. However, we found that currently, VAs are emulating human behavior by responding in complete sentences, limiting the design options, and preventing VAs from meeting their full potential as a utilitarian tool. We implemented a VA that handles requests in three response styles: two differing short keyword-based response styles and a full-sentence baseline. In a user study, 72 participants interacted with our VA by issuing eight requests. Results show that the short responses were perceived similarly useful and likable while being perceived as more efficient, especially for commands, and sometimes better to comprehend than the baseline. To achieve widespread adoption, we argue that VAs should be customizable and adapt to users instead of always responding in full sentences.

Towards Complete Icon Labeling in Mobile Applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502073,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502073,"
 Accurately recognizing icon types in mobile applications is integral to many tasks, including accessibility improvement, UI design search, and conversational agents. Existing research focuses on recognizing the most frequent icon types, but these technologies fail when encountering an unrecognized low-frequency icon. In this paper, we work towards complete coverage of icons in the wild. After annotating a large-scale icon dataset (327,879 icons) from iPhone apps, we found a highly uneven distribution: 98 common icon types covered 92.8% of icons, while 7.2% of icons were covered by more than 331 long-tail icon types. In order to label icons with widely varying occurrences in apps, our system uses an image classification model to recognize common icon types with an average of 3,000 examples each (96.3% accuracy) and applies a few-shot learning model to classify long-tail icon types with an average of 67 examples each (78.6% accuracy). Our system also detects contextual information that helps characterize icon semantics, including nearby text (95.3% accuracy) and modifier symbols added to the icon (87.4% accuracy). In a validation study with workers (n = 23), we verified the usefulness of our generated icon labels. The icon types supported by our work cover 99.5% of collected icons, improving on the previously highest 78% coverage in icon classification work.

Owning mistakes sincerely: Strategies for mitigating AI errors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517565,6,https://www.academia.edu/download/86952490/2022-chi-mahmood.pdf,"
 Interactive AI systems such as voice assistants are bound to make errors because of imperfect sensing and reasoning. Prior human-AI interaction research has illustrated the importance of various strategies for error mitigation in repairing the perception of an AI following a breakdown in service. These strategies include explanations, monetary rewards, and apologies. This paper extends prior work on error mitigation by exploring how different methods of apology conveyance may affect people’s perceptions of AI agents; we report an online study (N=37) that examines how varying the sincerity of an apology and the assignment of blame (on either the agent itself or others) affects participants’ perceptions and experience with erroneous AI agents. We found that agents that openly accepted the blame and apologized sincerely for mistakes were thought to be more intelligent, likeable, and effective in recovering from errors than agents that shifted the blame to others.

 Reducing uncertainty around the nature of racist interactions is one of the key motivations driving individual behaviors for coping with those incidents. However, there are few appropriate technologies to support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) in engaging in social uncertainty reduction around this vulnerable, sensitive topic. This paper reports on an exploratory design study investigating how social technology might facilitate uncertainty reduction through three “provotypes” - provocative prototypes of user-generated speculative design concepts. U.S.-based participants engaged with the provotypes through an interactive fiction to explore their usefulness in the context of a racist microaggression. Results showed that engaging the provotypes through interactive fiction facilitated complex and productive interactions and critiques. This work contributes a novel method for conducting exploratory design, remote user studies using interactive fiction as well as priorities, tensions, and further information what role, if any, technology might play in managing racist interactions.

Polite or direct? Conversation design of a smart display for older adults based on politeness theory,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517525,5,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15767,"
 Conversational interfaces increasingly rely on human-like dialogue to offer a natural experience. However, relying on dialogue involving multiple exchanges for even simple tasks can overburden users, particularly older adults. In this paper, we explored the use of politeness theory in conversation design to alleviate this burden and improve user experience. To achieve this goal, we categorized the voice interaction offered by a smart display application designed for older adults into seven major speech acts: request, suggest, instruct, comment, welcome, farewell, and repair. We identified face needs for each speech act, applied politeness strategies that best address these needs, and tested the ability of these strategies to shape the perceived politeness of a voice assistant in an online study (n = 64). Based on the findings of this study, we designed direct and polite versions of the system and conducted a field study (n = 15) in which participants used each of the versions for five days at their homes. Based on five factors merged from our qualitative findings, we identified four distinctive user personas—socially oriented follower, socially oriented leader, utility oriented follower, and utility oriented leader—that can inform personalized design of smart displays.

(Dis) Appearables: A Concept and Method for Actuated Tangible UIs to Appear and Disappear based on Stages,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501906,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501906,"
(Dis)Appearables is an approach for actuated Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) to appear and disappear. This technique is supported by Stages: physical platforms inspired by theatrical stages. Self-propelled TUI’s autonomously move between front and back stage allowing them to dynamically appear and disappear from users’ attention. This platform opens up a novel interaction design space for expressive displays with dynamic physical affordances.  We demonstrate and explore this approach based on a proof-of-concept implementation using two-wheeled robots, and multiple stage design examples. We have implemented a stage design pipeline which allows users to plan and design stages that are composed with front and back stages, and transition portals such as trap doors or lifts. The pipeline includes control of the robots, which guides them on and off stage. With this proof-of-concept prototype, we demonstrated a range of applications including interactive mobility simulation, self re-configuring desktops, remote hockey, and storytelling/gaming. Inspired by theatrical stage designs, this is a new take on ‘controlling the existence of matter’ for user experience design.

Despite an abundance of carefully-crafted tutorials, trial-and-error remains many people’s preferred way to learn complex software. Yet, approaches to facilitate trial-and-error (such as tooltips) have evolved very little since the 1980s. While existing mechanisms work well for simple software, they scale poorly to large feature-rich applications. In this paper, we explore new techniques to support trial-and-error in complex applications. We identify key benefits and challenges of trial-and-error, and introduce a framework with a conceptual model and design space. Using this framework, we developed three techniques: ToolTrack to keep track of trial-and-error progress; ToolTrip to go beyond trial-and-error of single commands by highlighting related commands that are frequently used together; and ToolTaste to quickly and safely try commands. We demonstrate how these techniques facilitate trial-and-error, as illustrated through a proof-of-concept implementation in the CAD software Fusion 360. We conclude by discussing possible scenarios and outline directions for future research on trial-and-error.

 Increased levels of interactivity and multi-sensory stimulation have been shown to enhance the immersion of Virtual Reality experiences. We present the AirRes mask that enables users to utilize their breathing for precise natural interactions with the virtual environment without suffering from limitations of the sensing equipment such as motion artifacts. Furthermore, the AirRes mask provides breathing resistance as novel output modality that can be adjusted in real-time by the application. In a user study, we demonstrate the mask’s precision measurements for interaction as well as its ability to use breathing resistance to communicate contextual information such as adverse environmental conditions that affect the user’s virtual avatar. Our results show that the AirRes mask enhances virtual experiences and has the potential to create more immersive scenarios for applications by enforcing the perception of danger or improving situational awareness in training simulations, or for psychotherapy by providing additional physical stimuli.

 The acoustic and visual experiences of musicians in the spaces they perform in are complex and organic in nature, entailing a continuous interaction with the environment. With this project, we leverage the power of Virtual Reality (VR) to support musicians in their creative practice by transporting them to novel sonic and visual worlds. For this, we developed a musician-centred VR system, featuring various acoustic and visual virtual environments, VR Rehearse & Perform, based on design requirements gathered with musicians and performance experts. To investigate how VR can be designed to support music-makers in their creative musical practice, we performed iterative tests with 19 musicians followed by semi-structured interviews. Our findings suggest that VR has the potential to support different aspects of the creative musical practice, such as rehearsing, performing and improvising. Our research provides insights and inspirations toward designing musician-centred VR experiences for various musical activities.

Too often, while interacting with online technologies, we blindly agree to services’ terms and conditions (T&Cs). We often disregard their content—believing it is not worth engaging with the long, hard-to-understand texts. The inconspicuous display of online T&Cs on the user interface (UI) adds to our lack of engagement. Nevertheless, certain information included in T&Cs could help us make optimal decisions. In this replication research, we investigate this issue in the purchasing context. We confirm and extend previous findings through an online experiment (N = 987), showing that differently presented T&Cs (icons, scroll, and cost-cue) compared to hyperlinked text affect whether people open them, becoming aware. We also show the effect of decision-making style on the relationship between awareness and satisfaction. We discuss the possible use of these findings to improve users’ informed decisions. We also highlight problems that different designs may pose, potentially increasing the information gap between users and service providers.

Conference authorship, attendance and presentation is a key measure of quality in the HCI academic, yet we know conferences are not equally accessible for reasons that have nothing to do with quality. In this paper we examine two axes of diversity: gender, and geographic location (of both authors and conferences) and examine how they affect participation at major HCI conferences. Diversity in a group is associated with better outcomes from its work, and HCI has made numerous contributions to increasing representation in other communities. Reflecting on our own situation can produce recommendations for the planning of future HCI conferences, and identify challenges of representation that the HCI community should endeavor to address.

Exploring perceptions of cross-sectoral data sharing with people with parkinson's,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501984,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501984,"
 In interdisciplinary spaces such as digital health, datasets that are complex to collect, require specialist facilities, and/or are collected with specific populations have value in a range of different sectors. In this study we collected a simulated free-living dataset, in a smart home, with 12 participants (six people with Parkinson’s, six carers). We explored their initial perceptions of the sensors through interviews and then conducted two data exploration workshops, wherein we showed participants the collected data and discussed their views on how this data, and other data relating to their Parkinson’s symptoms, might be shared across different sectors. We provide recommendations around how participants might be better engaged in considering data sharing in the early stages of research, and guidance for how research might be configured to allow for more informed data sharing practices in the future.

"Design Futuring for Love, Friendship, and Kinships: Five Perspectives on Intimacy",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516388,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Grace-Eden/publication/360265644_Design_Futuring_for_Love_Friendship_and_Kinships_Five_Perspectives_on_Intimacy/links/62a19dbf55273755ebdf3555/Design-Futuring-for-Love-Friendship-and-Kinships-Five-Perspectives-on-Intimacy.pdf,"
Human relationships, intimacy and the role of technology within it constantly change, catapulted in 2020 by COVID-19. We take this social rupture as an opportunity to reimagine possible futures for love, friendship, and kinships. Through design futuring and related approaches, we offer five prompts we developed for imagining alternative futures exploring a diverse range of intimacies. Through generating responses to the prompts, we offer alternative intimate futures as well as reflections on how such 'prompts for futuring' can be generative for design research. Our work extends calls for diversifying design futuring, imploring design researchers to consider diverse and inclusive ways of designing for futures, especially for human relationships and intimacy.

Hybridtrak: adding full-body tracking to VR using an off-the-shelf webcam,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502045,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502045,"
 Full-body tracking in virtual reality improves presence, allows interaction via body postures, and facilitates better social expression among users. However, full-body tracking systems today require a complex setup fixed to the environment (e.g., multiple lighthouses/cameras) and a laborious calibration process, which goes against the desire to make VR systems more portable and integrated. We present HybridTrak, which provides accurate, real-time full-body tracking by augmenting inside-out1 upper-body VR tracking systems with a single external off-the-shelf RGB web camera. HybridTrak uses a full-neural solution to convert and transform users’ 2D full-body poses from the webcam to 3D poses leveraging the inside-out upper-body tracking data. We showed HybridTrak is more accurate than RGB or depth-based tracking methods on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset. We also tested HybridTrak in the popular VRChat app and showed that body postures presented by HybridTrak are more distinguishable and more natural than a solution using an RGBD camera.

Exposar: Bringing augmented reality to the computational thinking agenda through a collaborative authoring tool,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517636,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jens-Emil-Gronbaek/publication/359816876_ExposAR_Bringing_Augmented_Reality_to_the_Computational_Thinking_Agenda_through_a_Collaborative_Authoring_Tool/links/625015dd4f88c3119ce9fccf/ExposAR-Bringing-Augmented-Reality-to-the-Computational-Thinking-Agenda-through-a-Collaborative-Authoring-Tool.pdf,"
There is a growing focus on computational thinking (CT) in terms of supporting children’s understanding of everyday technologies. But unlike other technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) has received limited attention. In this paper, we present ExposAR – a collaborative cross-device AR system enabling children to create, use, and reflect on AR technologies through the co-creation of a simple AR application. With ExposAR, we explore three core design principles: 1) reify computational concepts, 2) support collaborative cross-device authoring, and 3) incorporate the user’s own world. These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR. With these results, we bring AR to the CT agenda and contribute novel design principles for exposing the underlying mechanisms and implications of AR.

“Rewind to the Jiggling Meat Part”: Understanding Voice Control of Instructional Videos in Everyday Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502036,4,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1683491/FULLTEXT01.pdf,"
 Voice interaction has long been envisioned as enabling users to transform physical interaction into hands-free, such as allowing fine-grained control of instructional videos without physically disengaging from the task at hand. While significant engineering advances have brought us closer to this ideal, we do not fully understand the user requirements for voice interactions that should be supported in such contexts. This paper presents an ecologically-valid wizard-of-oz elicitation study exploring realistic user requirements for an ideal instructional video playback control while cooking. Through the analysis of the issued commands and performed actions during this non-linear and complex task, we identify (1) patterns of command formulation, (2) challenges for design, and (3) how task and voice-based commands are interwoven in real-life. We discuss implications for the design and research of voice interactions for navigating instructional videos while performing complex tasks.

Pet-robot or appliance? Care home residents with dementia respond to a zoomorphic floor washing robot,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517463,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517463,"
Any active entity that shares space with people is interpreted as a social actor. Based on this notion, we explore how robots that integrate functional utility with a social role and character can integrate meaningfully into daily practice. Informed by interviews and observations, we designed a zoomorphic floor cleaning robot which playfully interacts with care home residents affected by dementia. A field study shows that playful interaction can facilitate the introduction of utilitarian robots in care homes, being nonthreatening and easy to make sense of. Residents previously reacted with distress to a Roomba robot, but were now amused by and played with our cartoonish cat robot or simply tolerated its presence. They showed awareness of the machine-nature of the robot, even while engaging in pretend-play. A playful approach to the design of functional robots can thus explicitly conceptualize such robots as social actors in their context of use.

Designing Credibility Tools To Combat Mis/Disinformation: A Human-Centered Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503700,3,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146271/3491101.3503700.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
Misinformation and disinformation are proliferating in societies compromising our ability to make informed decisions. Currently a myriad of tools, technologies, and interventions are designed to aid users in making informed decisions when they encounter content of dubious credibility. However, with the advancement of technology, new forms of fake media are emerging such as deepfakes and cheapfakes containing synthetic images, videos, and audio. Combating these new forms of fake media requires tools and interventions understanding the new context. In this case, designers and developers of these tools need to examine user experience and perspectives on new contexts and understand multidisciplinary view points before designing any tools. This workshop calls for multidisciplinary participation to interrogate the current landscape of misinformation tools and to work towards understanding nuances of user experience of these new fake media and perceptions of tools that support users to distinguish credible from inaccurate content. This workshop intends to solicit a human-centric design framework which can act as a UX design guideline when designing and developing tools for combating mis/disinformation.

Kuiper Belt: Utilizing the “Out-of-Natural Angle” Region in the Eye-Gaze Interaction for Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517725,4,,"
 The maximum physical range of horizontal human eye movement is approximately 45°. However, in a natural gaze shift, the difference in the direction of the gaze relative to the frontal direction of the head rarely exceeds 25°. We name this region of 25° − 45° the “Kuiper Belt” in the eye-gaze interaction. We try to utilize this region to solve the Midas touch problem to enable a search task while reducing false input in the Virtual Reality environment. In this work, we conduct two studies to figure out the design principle of how we place menu items in the Kuiper Belt as an “out-of-natural angle” region of the eye-gaze movement, and determine the effectiveness and workload of the Kuiper Belt-based method. The results indicate that the Kuiper Belt-based method facilitated the visual search task while reducing false input. Finally, we present example applications utilizing the findings of these studies.

FingerX: Rendering Haptic Shapes of Virtual Objects Augmented by Real Objects using Extendable and Withdrawable Supports on Fingers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517489,4,https://scholar.archive.org/work/aazve7hu2nh33c25p5cdek6uoy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517489,"
 Interacting with not only virtual but also real objects, or even virtual objects augmented by real objects becomes a trend of virtual reality (VR) interactions and is common in augmented reality (AR). However, current haptic shape rendering devices generally focus on feedback of virtual objects, and require the users to put down or take off those devices to perceive real objects. Therefore, we propose FingerX to render haptic shapes and enable users to touch, grasp and interact with virtual and real objects simultaneously. An extender on the fingertip extends to a corresponding height to support between the fingertip and the real objects or the hand, to render virtual shapes. A ring rotates and withdraws the extender behind the fingertip when touching real objects. By independently controlling four extenders and rings on each finger with the exception of the pinky finger, FingerX renders feedback in three common scenarios, including touching virtual objects augmented by real environments (e.g., a desk), grasping virtual objects augmented by real objects (e.g., a bottle) and grasping virtual objects in the hand. We conducted a shape recognition study to evaluate the recognition rates for these three scenarios and obtained an average recognition rate of 76.59% with shape visual feedback. We then performed a VR study to observe how users interact with virtual and real objects simultaneously and verify that FingerX significantly enhances VR realism, compared to current vibrotactile methods.

Q-Chef: The impact of surprise-eliciting systems on food-related decision-making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501862,4,https://scholar.archive.org/work/tzzgjkvl4rdjdbb6iam3jj4cua/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501862,"
 Choosing what to eat requires navigating a large volume of information and various competing factors. While recommendation systems are an effective approach to assist users with this culinary decision-making, they typically prioritise similarity to a query or user profile to give relevant results. This can expose users to an increasingly narrow band of phenomena, which could compromise dietary diversity, a factor in dietary quality. We designed Q-Chef, which combines a recipe recommendation system with a personalised model of surprise, and conducted a study to identify if surprise-eliciting recipes affect food decisions. Our study utilises a rigorous thematic analysis with over 40 participants to explore how computational models of surprise influence recipe choice. We also explored how these factors differed when people were presented with “surprising-yet-tasty” recipes, as opposed to just “tasty” recipes, and identified that being presented with surprising choices is more likely to elicit situational interest and prompt reflection on choices. We conclude with a set of suggestions for the design of future surprise-eliciting recipe systems.

We present a case study where we developed RHETORiC: an audience conversation tool that promotes civil participation in online news comments. By following a human-centered design process, we created and evaluated a novel tool with an interface that supports people in carefully formulating their opinions and arguments, so they can constructively contribute to online discussions about news. Results of a large-scale field study show that our tool succeeds in increasing the level of civility, argumentation and proficiency of comments in comparison with those on social media. On top, both users and journalists report high satisfaction with the RHETORiC tool. In our paper we reflect upon lessons learned about the design process as well as about the tool itself, which contributes to the fields of both Human-Computer Interaction and Digital Journalism.

Improving Agent-Based Route Predictions for As-The-Crow-Flies Navigation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519709,2,https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/server/api/core/bitstreams/4b18929a-2961-4580-9cc8-8f921224c5da/content,"
 Mobile navigation has become a ubiquitous technology through mobile devices and smartphones. One of these devices’ most-used navigation methods is the turn-by-turn method, first used in car-based navigation systems. However, pedestrians and cyclists increasingly use other methods such as the as-the-crow-flies (ATCF) navigation method instead of the classical turn-by-turn navigation. Instead of giving fixed instruction, ATCF navigation only indicates the straight-line direction to the destination and users have to make their own decision when and where to turn. In this paper, we improve the route predictions for such alternative navigation methods as ATFC by incorporating a model on users’ angle estimation error. We show that the route predictions are closer to actual human navigation behavior than methods proposed in related work.

 We present STRAIDE, a string-actuated interactive display environment that allows to explore the promising potential of shape-changing interfaces for casual visualizations. At the core, we envision a platform that spatially levitates elements to create dynamic visual shapes in space. We conceptualize this type of tangible mid-air display and discuss its multifaceted design dimensions. Through a design exploration, we realize a physical research platform with adjustable parameters and modular components. For conveniently designing and implementing novel applications, we provide developer tools ranging from graphical emulators to in-situ augmented reality representations. To demonstrate STRAIDE’s reconfigurability, we further introduce three representative physical setups as a basis for situated applications including ambient notifications, personal smart home controls, and entertainment. They serve as a technical validation, lay the foundations for a discussion with developers that provided valuable insights, and encourage ideas for future usage of this type of appealing interactive installation.

"The pattern is in the details: An evaluation of interaction techniques for locating, searching, and contextualizing details in multivariate matrix visualizations",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517673,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517673,"
Matrix visualizations are widely used to display large-scale network, tabular, set, or sequential data. They typically only encode a single value per cell, e.g., through color. However, this can greatly limit the visualizations’ utility when exploring multivariate data, where each cell represents a data point with multiple values (referred to as details). Three well-established interaction approaches can be applicable in multivariate matrix visualizations (or MMV): focus+context, pan&zoom, and overview+detail. However, there is little empirical knowledge of how these approaches compare in exploring MMV. We report on two studies comparing them for locating, searching, and contextualizing details in MMV. We first compared four focus+context techniques and found that the fisheye lens overall outperformed the others. We then compared the fisheye lens, to pan&zoom and overview+detail. We found that pan&zoom was faster in locating and searching details, and as good as overview+detail in contextualizing details.

 Visuo-haptic illusions are a method to expand proxy-based interactions in VR by introducing unnoticeable discrepancies between the virtual and real world. Yet how different design variables affect the illusions with proxies is still unclear. To unpack a subset of variables, we conducted two user studies with 48 participants to explore the impact of (1) different grasping types and movement trajectories, and (2) different grasping types and object masses on the discrepancy which may be introduced. Our Bayes analysis suggests that grasping types and object masses (≤ 500 g) did not noticeably affect the discrepancy, but for movement trajectory, results were inconclusive. Further, we identified a significant difference between (un)restricted movement trajectories. Our data shows considerable differences in participants’ proprioceptive accuracy, which seem to correlate with their prior VR experience. Finally, we illustrate the impact of our key findings on the visuo-haptic illusion design process by showcasing a new design workflow.

Preferences and effectiveness of sleep data visualizations for smartwatches and fitness bands,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501921,6,https://inria.hal.science/hal-03587029/file/chi22-103.pdf,"
We present the findings of four studies related to the visualization of sleep data on wearables with two form factors: smartwatches and fitness bands. Our goal was to understand the interests, preferences, and effectiveness of different sleep visualizations by form factor. In a survey, we showed that wearers were mostly interested in weekly sleep duration, and nightly sleep phase data. Visualizations of this data were generally preferred over purely text-based representations, and the preferred chart type for fitness bands, and smartwatches was often the same. In one in-person pilot study, and two crowdsourced studies, we then tested the effectiveness of the most preferred representations for different tasks, and found that participants performed simple tasks effectively on both form factors but more complex tasks benefited from the larger smartwatch size. Lastly, we reflect on our crowdsourced study methodology for testing the effectiveness of visualizations for wearables. Supplementary material is available at https://osf.io/yz8ar/.

HydroMod: Constructive Modules for Prototyping Hydraulic Physical Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502096,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3502096,"
 In recent years, actuators that handle fluids such as gases and liquids have been attracting attention for their applications in soft robots and shape-changing interfaces. In the field of HCI, there have been various inflatable prototyping tools that utilize air control, however, very few tools for liquid control have been developed. In this study, we propose HydroMod, new constructive modules that can easily generate liquid flow and programmatically control liquid flow, with the aim of lowering the barrier to entry for prototyping with liquids. HydroMod consists of palm-sized small modules, which can generate liquid flow with the electrohydrodynamics (EHD) phenomenon by simply connecting the modules. Moreover, users can configure and control the flow path by simply recombining the modules. In this paper, we propose the design of the modules, evaluate the performance of HydroMod as a fluid system, and also show the possible application scenarios of fluid prototyping using this system.

AI-moderated decision-making: Capturing and balancing anchoring bias in sequential decision tasks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517443,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517443,"
Decision-making involves biases from past experiences, which are difficult to perceive and eliminate. We investigate a specific type of anchoring bias, in which decision-makers are anchored by their own recent decisions, e.g. a college admission officer sequentially reviewing students. We propose an algorithm that identifies existing anchored decisions, reduces sequential dependencies to previous decisions, and mitigates decision inaccuracies post-hoc with 2% increased agreement to ground-truth on a large-scale college admission decision data set. A crowd-sourced study validates this algorithm on product preferences (5% increased agreement). To avoid biased decisions ex-ante, we propose a procedure that presents instances in an order that reduces anchoring bias in real-time. Tested in another crowd-sourced study, it reduces bias and increases agreement to ground-truth by 7%. Our work reinforces individuals with similar characteristics to be treated similarly, independent of when they were reviewed in the decision-making process.

Katika: An End-to-End System for Authoring Amateur Explainer Motion Graphics Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517741,4,https://hci.cs.sfu.ca/JahanlouCHI22.pdf,"
Explainer motion graphics videos that use a combination of graphical elements and movement to convey a visual message are becoming increasingly popular among amateur creators in different domains. But, to author motion graphics videos, amateurs either have to face a steep learning curve with professional design tools or struggle with re-purposing slide-sharing tools that are easier to access but have limited animation capabilities. To simplify the process of motion graphics authoring, we present the design and implementation of Katika, an end-to-end system for creating shots based on a script, adding artworks and animation from a crowdsourced library, and editing the video using semi-automated transitions. Our observational study illustrates that participants (N=11) enjoyed using Katika and, within a one-hour session, managed to create an explainer motion graphics video. We identify opportunities for future HCI research to lower the barriers to entry and democratize the authoring of motion graphics videos.

Perceiving Affordances Differently: The Unintended Consequences When Young Autistic Adults Engage with Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517596,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517596,"
Social media can facilitate numerous benefits, ranging from facilitating access to social, instrumental, financial, and other support, to professional development and civic participation. However, these benefits may not be generalizable to all users. Therefore, we conducted an ethnographic case study with eight Autistic young adults, ten staff members, and four parents to understand how Autistic users of social media engage with others, as well as any unintended consequences of use. We leveraged an affordances perspective to understand how Autistic young adults share and consume user-generated content, make connections, and engage in networked interactions with others via social media. We found that they often used a literal interpretation of digital affordances that sometimes led to negative consequences including physical harm, financial loss, social anxiety, feelings of exclusion, and inadvertently damaging their social relationships. We make recommendations for redesigning social media affordances to be more inclusive of neurodiverse users.

This workshop aims to support the futuring of user experience and user interfaces, and will engage with stakeholders, practicing designers, researchers, students and educators in order to understand better the needs for next-generation design tools. We will envisage new forms of design tools that encourage best practice, for example, linking representations, analysis tools, just-in-time evidence, physicality, experience, and crucially, put context at the centre of design.

Shaping textile sliders: an evaluation of form factors and tick marks for textile sliders,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517473,6,,"
 Textile interfaces enable designers to integrate unobtrusive media and smart home controls into furniture such as sofas. While the technical aspects of such controllers have been the subject of numerous research projects, the physical form factor of these controls has received little attention so far. This work investigates how general design properties, such as overall slider shape, raised vs. recessed sliders, and number and layout of tick marks, affect users’ preferences and performance. Our first user study identified a preference for certain design combinations, such as recessed, closed-shaped sliders. Our second user study included performance measurements on variations of the preferred designs from study 1, and took a closer look at tick marks. Tick marks supported orientation better than slider shape. Sliders with at least three tick marks were preferred, and performed well. Non-uniform, equally distributed tick marks reduced the movements users needed to orient themselves on the slider.

Mobilizing crowdwork: A systematic assessment of the mobile usability of hits,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501876,5,https://infovisu.com/assets/pubs/dutta2022mobilizing.pdf,"
 There is a growing interest in extending crowdwork beyond traditional desktop-centric design to include mobile devices (e.g., smartphones). However, mobilizing crowdwork remains significantly tedious due to a lack of understanding about the mobile usability requirements of human intelligence tasks (HITs). We present a taxonomy of characteristics that defines the mobile usability of HITs for smartphone devices. The taxonomy is developed based on findings from a study of three consecutive steps. In Step 1, we establish an initial design of our taxonomy through a targeted literature analysis. In Step 2, we verify and extend the taxonomy through an online survey with Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers. Finally, in Step 3 we demonstrate the taxonomy’s utility by applying it to analyze the mobile usability of a dataset of scraped HITs. In this paper, we present the iterative development of the taxonomy, highlighting the observed practices and preferences around mobile crowdwork. We conclude with the implications of our taxonomy for accessibly and ethically mobilizing crowdwork not only within the context of smartphone devices, but beyond them.

 As the use of communication on social media among children increases, the cyberbullying phenomena is becoming a prominent challenge. We present the preliminary design of Tobe, a virtual keyboard that provides textual and visual feedback in real-time to help prevent harmful discourse on social media among elementary school-aged children. The widget is designed based on two unique principles: (1) An empathy based feedback mechanism which involves an animated character and verbal statements (both positive and negative); (2) A class specific solution in which children and the teacher build a vocabulary of words together. This element provides transparency as to why feedback was shown at any given moment, and can increase cooperation and empowerment for both the teacher and the children. We present the human centered design process and early results from a user study with 12 children. Our findings show high engagement with the system, and user awareness before texting.

This paper introduces the concept of “news informatics” to refer to journalistic presentation of big data in online sites. For users to be engaged with such data-driven public information, it is important to incorporate interactive tools so that each person can extract personally relevant information. Drawing upon a communication model of interactivity, we designed a data-rich site with three different types of interactive features—namely, modality interactivity, message interactivity, and source interactivity—and empirically tested their relative and combined effects on user engagement and user experience with a 2 (modality) × 3 (source) × 2 (message) field experiment (N =166). Findings shed light on how interface designers, online news editors and journalists can maximize user engagement with data-rich news content. Certain interactivity combinations are found to be better than others, with a structural equation model (SEM) revealing the underlying theoretical mechanisms and providing implications for the design of news informatics.

Eyes-off your fingers: Gradual surface haptic feedback improves eyes-free touchscreen interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501872,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501872,"
Moving a slider to set the music volume or control the air conditioning is a familiar task that requires little attention. However, adjusting a virtual slider on a featureless touchscreen is much more demanding and can be dangerous in situations such as driving. Here, we study how a gradual tactile feedback, provided by a haptic touchscreen, can replace visual cues. As users adjust a setting with their finger, they feel a continuously changing texture, which spatial frequency correlates to the value of the setting. We demonstrate that, after training with visual and auditory feedback, users are able to adjust a setting on a haptic touchscreen without looking at the screen, thereby reducing visual distraction. Every learning strategy yielded similar performance, suggesting an amodal integration. This study shows that surface haptics can provide intuitive and precise tuning possibilities for tangible interfaces on touchscreens.

VibEmoji: Exploring user-authoring multi-modal emoticons in social communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501940,5,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13555,"
 Emoticons are indispensable in online communications. With users’ growing needs for more customized and expressive emoticons, recent messaging applications begin to support (limited) multi-modal emoticons:, enhancing emoticons with animations or vibrotactile feedback. However, little empirical knowledge has been accumulated concerning how people create, share and experience multi-modal emoticons in everyday communication, and how to better support them through design. To tackle this, we developed VibEmoji, a user-authoring multi-modal emoticon interface for mobile messaging. Extending existing designs, VibEmoji grants users greater flexibility to combine various emoticons, vibrations, and animations on-the-fly, and offers non-aggressive recommendations based on these components’ emotional relevance. Using VibEmoji as a probe, we conducted a four-week field study with 20 participants, to gain new understandings from in-the-wild usage and experience, and extract implications for design. We thereby contribute to both a novel system and various insights for supporting users’ creation and communication of multi-modal emoticons.

Towards Balancing Real-World Awareness and VR Immersion in Mobile VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519824,3,http://www.mmi.ifi.lmu.de/pubdb/publications/pub/li2022chilbw/li2022chilbw.pdf,"
 Virtual Reality (VR) can be used to create immersive infotainment experiences for car passengers. However, not much is known about how to best incorporate the essentials of their surroundings for balancing real-world awareness and immersion. To address this gap, we explored 2D and 3D visual cues of the rear-seat space to notify passengers about different real-world tasks (lower armrest, take cup, close window, and hold handle) during a first-person game in VR. Results from our pilot study (n = 19) show that users perceive a lower workload in the task hold handle than all other tasks. They also feel more immersed in VR after completing this task, compared to take cup and close window. Based on our findings, we propose real-world task types, synchronous visual cues, and various input and transition approaches as promising future research directions.

"“I need to be professional until my new team uses emoji, GIFs, or memes first'': New Collaborators' Perspectives on Using Non-Textual Communication in Virtual …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517514,4,https://www.mingmingfan.com/papers/CHI_2022_Remote_Work.pdf,"
 Virtual workspaces rapidly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for many new collaborators, working remotely was their first introduction to their colleagues. Building rapport is essential for a healthy work environment, and while this can be achieved through non-textual responses within chat-based systems (e.g., emoji, GIF, stickers, memes), those non-textual responses are typically associated with personal relationships and informal settings. We studied the experiences of new collaborators (questionnaire N=49; interview N=14) in using non-textual responses to communicate with unacquainted teams and the effect of non-textual responses on new collaborators’ interpersonal bonds. We found new collaborators selectively and progressively use non-textual responses to establish interpersonal bonds. Moreover, the use of non-textual responses has exposed several limitations when used on various platforms. We conclude with design recommendations such as expanding the scope of interpretable non-textual responses and reducing selection time.

"Many Islands, Many Problems: An Empirical Examination of Online Safety Behaviors in the Caribbean",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517643,4,,"
 Little is known about non-Western social media users’ motivations for adopting behaviors that protect them against pervasive threats to their privacy, security, and personal well-being. Drawing on Rogers’ Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), this survey study explores Caribbean people’s (N=551) perceptions of safety threats and the factors contributing to their intention to adopt protective behaviors. Our analysis revealed that prior victimization was associated with increased perceptions of vulnerability and severity of harms, which, in turn, influenced elevated safety protection behaviors. For harassment-related harms in particular, participants’ trust in social media sites increased their intention to adopt protective behaviors. We observe significant country-to-country differences, which we contextualize through interviews with experts throughout the region. Our findings provide a new understanding of users’ mental models, behaviors, and attitudes with respect to online safety. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications and outline opportunities for the design of inclusive and culturally-aware safety tools.

Squeezy-Feely: Investigating Lateral Thumb-Index Pinching as an Input Modality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501981,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501981,"
 From zooming on smartphones and mid-air gestures to deformable user interfaces, thumb-index pinching grips are used in many interaction techniques. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of how the accuracy and efficiency of such grips are affected by various factors such as counterforce, grip span, and grip direction. Therefore, in this paper, we contribute an evaluation (N = 18) of thumb-index pinching performance in a visual targeting task using scales up to 75 items. As part of our findings, we conclude that the pinching interaction between the thumb and index finger is a promising modality also for one-dimensional input on higher scales. Furthermore, we discuss and outline implications for future user interfaces that benefit from pinching as an additional and complementary interaction modality.

Method for Appropriating the Brief Implicit Association Test to Elicit Biases in Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517570,4,https://nielsvanberkel.com/files/publications/chi2022b.pdf,"
Implicit tendencies and cognitive biases play an important role in how information is perceived and processed, a fact that can be both utilised and exploited by computing systems. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) has been widely used to assess people’s associations of target concepts with qualitative attributes, such as the likelihood of being hired or convicted depending on race, gender, or age. The condensed version–the Brief IAT–aims to implicit biases by measuring the reaction time to concept classifications. To use this measure in HCI research, however, we need a way to construct and validate target concepts, which tend to quickly evolve and depend on geographical and cultural interpretations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new method to appropriate the BIAT using crowdsourcing to measure people’s leanings on polarising topics. We present a web-based tool to test participants’ bias on custom themes, where self-assessments often fail. We validated our approach with 14 domain experts and assessed the fit of crowdsourced test construction. Our method allows researchers of different domains to create and validate bias tests that can be geographically tailored and updated over time. We discuss how our method can be applied to surface implicit user biases and run studies where cognitive biases may impede reliable results.

The Effect of Multiple Replies for Natural Language Generation Chatbots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516800,2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17209,"
 In this research, by responding to users’ utterances with multiple replies to create a group chat atmosphere, we alleviate the problem that Natural Language Generation chatbots might reply with inappropriate content, thus causing a bad user experience. Because according to our findings, users tend to pay attention to appropriate replies and ignore inappropriate replies. We conducted a 2 (single reply vs. five replies) × 2 (anonymous avatar vs. anime avatar) repeated measures experiment to compare the chatting experience in different conditions. The result shows that users will have a better chatting experience when receiving multiple replies at once from the NLG model compared to the single reply. Furthermore, according to the effect size of our result, to improve the chatting experience for NLG chatbots which is single reply and anonymous avatar, providing five replies will have more benefits than setting an anime avatar.

At-Home Pupillometry using Smartphone Facial Identification Cameras,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502493,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502493,"
 With recent developments in medical and psychiatric research surrounding pupillary response, cheap and accessible pupillometers could enable medical benefits from early neurological disease detection to measurements of cognitive load. In this paper, we introduce a novel smartphone-based pupillometer to allow for future development in clinical research surrounding at-home pupil measurements. Our solution utilizes a NIR front-facing camera for facial recognition paired with the RGB selfie camera to perform tracking of absolute pupil dilation with sub-millimeter accuracy. In comparison to a gold standard pupillometer during a pupillary light reflex test, the smartphone-based system achieves a median MAE of 0.27mm for absolute pupil dilation tracking and a median error of 3.52% for pupil dilation change tracking. Additionally, we remotely deployed the system to older adults as part of a usability study that demonstrates promise for future smartphone deployments to remotely collect data in older, inexperienced adult users operating the system themselves.

 This paper investigates how the conceptions of gender in memes are central to socializing at hackathons. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography of seven hackathons, I provide insight into how references to memes and informal technology culture shape interaction in local manifestations of this culture. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, I show how vocabularies and artifacts of technology culture move between on and offline spaces. These findings have implications for HCI research that investigates questions of materiality in computer-mediated communication. Second, I show how even the mundane memes of technology culture can reveal the toxic masculinity and ideology of Incels. By tying these internet memes to a physical context, I unpack how humor can reveal and perpetuate the enduring masculine dominance of technology. I end with recommendations for increasing inclusivity at hackathons, based on how HCI is uniquely positioned to understand how Internet symbols and interactions manifest offline.

” Your Eyes Tell You Have Used This Password Before”: Identifying Password Reuse from Gaze and Keystroke Dynamics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517531,7,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/267383/1/267383.pdf,"
A significant drawback of text passwords for end-user authentication is password reuse. We propose a novel approach to detect password reuse by leveraging gaze as well as typing behavior and study its accuracy. We collected gaze and typing behavior from 49 users while creating accounts for 1) a webmail client and 2) a news website. While most participants came up with a new password, 32% reported having reused an old password when setting up their accounts. We then compared different ML models to detect password reuse from the collected data. Our models achieve an accuracy of up to 87.7% in detecting password reuse from gaze, 75.8% accuracy from typing, and 88.75% when considering both types of behavior. We demonstrate that using gaze, password reuse can already be detected during the registration process, before users entered their password. Our work paves the road for developing novel interventions to prevent password reuse.

Design is worth a thousand words: The effect of digital interaction design on picture-prompted reminiscence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517692,5,http://www.sfu.ca/~raxtell/pubs/DesignIsWorth1000CHI2022.pdf,"
Interactions with our personal and family pictures are essential to continued social reminiscence, leading to long-term benefits, including reduced social isolation. Previous research has identified how designs of digital picture tools fall short of physical options specifically in terms of reminiscence. However, the relative prompting abilities of different digital interactions, including the types of memories prompted like external facts or person-centred memories, have not yet been explored. To investigate this, we present a controlled study of the memories prompted by three digital picture interactions (slideshow, gallery, and tabletop) on personal touchscreen devices. We find differences in how these tools and the interactions they support prompt reminiscence. In particular, gallery views prompt significantly fewer memories than either the tabletop or slideshow. Slideshows prompt significantly more external, factual memories, but not more person-centred memories, which are key to reminiscence. This has implications for the overall social usability of digital picture interactions.

 Online investigations are increasingly conducted by individuals with diverse skill levels and experiences, with mixed results. Novice investigations often result in vigilantism or doxxing, while expert investigations have greater success rates and fewer mishaps. Many of these experts are involved in a community of practice known as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), with an ethos and set of techniques for conducting investigations using only publicly available data. Through semi-structured interviews with 14 expert OSINT investigators from nine different organizations, we examine the social dynamics of this community, including the collaboration and competition patterns that underlie their investigations. We also describe investigators’ use of and challenges with existing OSINT tools, and implications for the design of social computing systems to better support crowdsourced investigations.

Slabforge: Design Software for Slab-Based Ceramics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517663,6,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10389599,"
 Slab-based ceramics are constructed by rolling out flat sheets of clay, cutting out a pattern, and then folding the cut clay to build a three-dimensional design. Slabforge is an open-source web-based software application that supports slab-based ceramics. It enables users to design a range of simple 3D forms and then generate flat patterns and matching 3D-printable slump molds that support the construction of those forms. This paper discusses the development of the software in the context of our own ceramics practice and then describes the results of a study in which students in an introductory ceramics course used Slabforge to create tea sets. We use both of these experiences to motivate a critical reflection on the relationships between materials, craft, digital fabrication, and software, introducing three themes of friction that we encountered during the course of this project.

 Advances in speech recognition, language processing and natural interaction have led to an increased industrial and academic interest. While the robustness and usability of such systems are steadily increasing, speech-based systems are still susceptible to recognition errors. This makes intelligent error handling of utmost importance for the success of those systems. In this work, we integrated anticipatory error handling for a voice-controlled video game where the game would perform a locally optimized action in respect to goal completion and obstacle avoidance, when a command is not recognized. We evaluated the user experience of our approach versus traditional, repetition-based error handling (). Our results indicate that implementing anticipatory error handling can improve the usability of a system, if it follows the intention of the user. Otherwise, it impairs the user experience, even when deciding for technically optimal decisions.

F-commerce and Urban Modernities: The Changing Terrain of Housing Design in Bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502071,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/csulfirknbagtcgwgcdxbrnoee/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502071,"
 This paper critically examines the impacts of social media-based business on urban residential architecture in Dhaka, Bangladesh and joins the growing body of work in critical HCI. Based on a seven-month-long qualitative empirical study in Dhaka, this paper reports how Facebook commerce (F-commerce) drives many local women to actively engage in home-based businesses, which in turn, challenges the inherent spatial regulations of modern residential architecture. This paper also documents how F-commerce mediated transformations in residential spaces are promoting heterogeneous functions, re-surfacing traditional values, and altering orders and rationales that define modern housing. Drawing from a rich body of literature in urban housing architecture, critical theories around modernism, South-Asian feminism, and postcolonial computing, we explain how these spatial transformations and alterations are “appropriating” architectural design vocabularies. Our findings further explain how negligence toward such emerging needs often marginalizes the women spatially and economically, who are involved in F-commerce. We conclude with design implications to architecture and HCI to address these issues, and connect our findings to the broader agendas of Postcolonial HCI around diversity, inclusion, and global development.

Understanding Smartphone Notifications' Activity Disruption via In Situ Wrist Motion Monitoring,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519695,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/4jljyruiu5fvnpota5cy3aawv4/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519695,"
 The disruptive nature of smartphone notifications and their negative impact on users’ productivity are well documented. The majority of these results either originate from controlled laboratory studies, or protocols relying on subjective self-reporting, reducing their ecological validity. This paper presents results from a full day in situ study investigating the impact of perceiving one’s smartphone notifications on wrist motion patterns. Through this objective behavioral assessment, we document for the first time the manifestations of notification-induced disruption outside of the lab, independently of user activity and without the need for self-reporting. We identified a decrease in wrist motion activity following the presentation of a notification while the participant was engaged in higher intensity activities, independently of whether the notification is immediately attended to. These findings provide objective support for the claim that notifications have as much potential for disruption when merely perceived as they do when the user actually responds to them.

How to Save Lives with Microblogs? Lessons From the Usage of Weibo for Requests for Medical Assistance During COVID-19,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517591,4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07371,"
During recent crises like COVID-19, microblogging platforms have become popular channels for affected people seeking assistance such as medical supplies and rescue operations from emergency responders and the public. Despite this common practice, the affordances of microblogging services for help-seeking during crises that needs immediate attention are not well understood. To fill this gap, we analyzed 8K posts from COVID-19 patients or caregivers requesting urgent medical assistance on Weibo, the largest microblogging site in China. Our mixed-methods analyses suggest that existing microblogging functions need to be improved in multiple aspects to sufficiently facilitate help-seeking in emergencies, including capabilities of search and tracking requests, ease of use, and privacy protection. We also find that people tend to stick to certain well-established functions for publishing requests, even after better alternatives emerge. These findings have implications for designing microblogging tools to better support help requesting and responding during crises.

"Seamless Visions, Seamful Realities: Anticipating Rural Infrastructural Fragility in Early Design of Digital Agriculture",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517579,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517579,"
 Rural infrastructure is known to be more prone to breakdown than urban infrastructure. This paper explores how the fragility of rural infrastructure is reproduced through the process of engineering design. Building on values in design, we examine how eventual use is anticipated by engineering researchers building on emerging infrastructure for digital agriculture (DA). Our approach combines critically reflective technical systems-building with interviews with other practitioners to understand and address moments early in the design process where the eventual effects of DA systems may be being built-in. Our findings contrast researchers’ visions of seamless farming technologies with the seamful realities of their work to produce them. We trace how, when anticipating future use, the seams that researchers themselves experience disappear, other seams are hidden from view by institutional support, and seams end users may face are too distant to be in sight. We develop suggestions for the design of these technologies grounded in a more artful management of seamfulness and seamlessness during the process of design and development.

As interest within the HCI community expands beyond urban settings, novel tools and devices are being developed to support more sustainable interactions with natural environments and inform conservation action. Yet little is known about the users of these devices, and how their requirements and priorities might affect the usability or operationalization of the devices in the real world. Using the ‘e-seed’, a biomimetic self-drilling interface as a ‘research probe’, we conducted a qualitative user study with 14 subject matter experts in areas like forestry and agriculture to understand the value and limits for devices and systems in ecological restoration and monitoring. We highlight unique challenges in existing ecological practices, opportunities for technological interventions, and the policies and economic constraints affecting the feasibility of such interventions. We present a set of critical design considerations for building and deploying novel devices in natural and semi-natural ecosystems and discuss implications for future research.

Virtual Transcendent Dream: Empowering People through Embodied Flying in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517677,5,https://scholar.archive.org/work/y6qo5uezrbazhncxeq75kwut24/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517677,"
 Flying dreams have the potential to evoke a feeling of empowerment (or self-efficacy, confidence in our ability to succeed) and self-transcendent experience (STE), which have been shown to contribute to an individual’s overall well-being. However, these exceptional dreaming experiences remain difficult to induce at will. Inspired by the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) to support profound emotional experiences, we explored if a VR flying interface with more embodied self-motion cues could contribute to the benefits associated with flying dreams (i.e., STE and empowerment). Our results indicated that a flying interface with more self-motion cues indeed better supported STE and empowerment. We derived several design considerations: obscurity, extraordinary light and supportive setting. Our results contribute to the discourse around design guidelines for self-transcendence and empowerment in VR, which may further be applied to the improvement of mental well-being.

Personas represent the needs of users in diverse populations and impact design by endearing empathy and improving communication. While personas have been lauded for their benefits, we could locate no prior review of persona use cases in design, prompting the question: how are personas actually used to achieve these benefits? To address this question, we review 95 articles containing persona application across multiple domains, and identify software development, healthcare, and higher education as the top domains that employ personas. We then present a three-stage design hierarchy of persona usage to describe how personas are used in design tasks. Finally, we assess the increasing trend of persona initiatives aimed towards social good rather than solely commercial interests. Our findings establish a roadmap of best practices for how practitioners can innovatively employ personas to increase the value of designs and highlight avenues of using personas for socially impactful purposes.

 We explore privacy perceptions, beliefs and practices of low-literate, low-income users in Pakistan, a patriarchal and religious context with a literacy rate of approx. 68% and where 59% of mobile users have less than 6 years of formal education. Through a qualitative study with 40 participants (17 male and 23 female) we examine the cultural, religious, and familial structures that impact users perceptions, management, and control of their personal privacy. We reveal significant gendered differences in privacy understandings, privacy preserving practices and the access to privacy related knowledge. Our work also highlights the seminal impact religious beliefs have on men and women’s understandings and management of privacy and the prolific use of after-market modified apps to support users specific privacy needs. The privacy concerns raised by our participants provide HCI researchers with valuable insights into designing privacy affordances for vulnerable and diverse populations beyond Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic contexts.

It's Touching: Understanding Touch-Affect Association in Shape-Change with Kinematic Features,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502003,5,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IO6uO2R8valn9iAU8asOo3fjaRMmtktj/view,"
 With the proliferation of shape-change research in affective computing, there is a need to deepen understandings of affective responses to shape-change display. Little research has focused on affective reactions to tactile experiences in shape-change, particularly in the absence of visual information. It is also rare to study response to the shape-change as it unfolds, isolated from a final shape-change outcome. We report on two studies on touch-affect associations, using the crossmodal “Bouba-Kiki” paradigm, to understand affective responses to shape-change as it unfolds. We investigate experiences with a shape-change gadget, as it moves between rounded (“Bouba”) and spiky (“Kiki”) forms. We capture affective responses via the circumplex model, and use a motion analysis approach to understand the certainty of these responses. We find that touch-affect associations are influenced by both the size and the frequency of the shape-change and may be modality-dependent, and that certainty in affective associations is influenced by association-consistency.

Transitioning toward independence: enhancing collaborative self-management of children with type 1 diabetes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502055,4,https://scholar.archive.org/work/o5q6ddfdfbazhjwjbr7h5p3htm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502055,"
 Although child participation is required for successful Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, it is challenging because the child’s young age and immaturity make it difficult to perform self-care. Thus, parental caregivers are expected to be heavily involved in their child’s everyday illness management. Our study aims to investigate how children and parents collaborate to manage T1D and examine how the children become more independent in their self-management through the support of their parents. Through semi-structured interviews with children with T1D and their parents (N=41), our study showed that children’s knowledge of illness management and motivation for self-care were crucial for their transition towards independence. Based on these two factors, we identified four types of children’s collaboration (i.e., dependent, resistant, eager, and independent) and parents’ strategies for supporting their children’s independence. We suggest design implications for technologies to support collaborative care by improving children’s transition to independent illness management.

Behavior change and improving health literacy based on normative ideals of motherhood is a dominant paradigm to address maternal health challenges. However, these ideals often remove women's control over their bodies overlooking how the bodily experiences of pregnancy are socially and culturally constructed. We report on 27 interviews with pregnant women and nursing mothers in rural and semi-urban areas of South India, and six focus groups with 23 frontline health workers as secondary data. We explore how the embodied pregnancy experiences are influenced and negotiated by the socio-cultural context and existing care infrastructures. Our findings highlight how the ways of seeing, knowing, and caring for a body of a pregnant woman through often conflicting norms, beliefs and practices of medicine, nourishment and care actively shape the experiences of pregnancy. We open up a space for novel opportunities for digital health technologies to enhance women's embodied experiences and pregnancy care infrastructures in the Global South.

Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap explores novel ways to represent quantum phenomena in an interactive and intuitive way. It is an online laboratory with a real-time simulation of an optical table, supporting up to 3 entangled particles. We have created a highly visual no-code interface and an introductory Quantum Game to make the Virtual Lab approachable for users without prior exposure to quantum mechanics. At the same time, a configurable sandbox mode with customizable elements makes it useful for students, lecturers, and scientists. Virtual Lab provides a way to explore exact quantum states, entanglement, and the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. We provide ways to simulate quantum computing (e.g. Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm), use quantum cryptography (e.g. BB84 protocol), explore counterintuitive quantum phenomena (e.g. quantum teleportation), and recreate historical experiments (e.g. Michaelson-Morley interferometer).

We report on a Diary Study investigating daily practices of Self-care by seven UK adults living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), to understand their routines, experiences, needs and concerns, informing Self-care technology design to support living well. We advance a developing HCI literature evidencing how digital tools for self-managing health do not meet the complex needs of those living with long-term conditions, especially those from marginalised communities. Our evaluation of using a Self-care Diary as Design Probe responds to calls to study Self-care practices so that future digital health tools are better grounded in lived experiences of managing multi-morbidity. We contribute to HCI discourses including Personal Health Informatics, Lived Informatics and Reflection by illuminating psychosocial challenges for practicing and self-reporting on Self-care. We offer design implications from a Critical Digital Health perspective, addressing barriers to technology use related to trust, privacy, and representation, gaining new significance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 We can now buy consumer brain-computer interface devices to help us meditate and focus, but what are we aiming to achieve? Mental workload (MWL) is an established concept, and as a form of personal data could be useful for making positive life changes. However, MWL is typically only studied for isolated tasks to avoid overload and underload. We investigated lived experiences of MWL, aiming to understand how tracking such data could implicate our everyday lives. 19 participants, that had previously experienced tracking their mental workload, took part in interviews and an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis identified four superordinate themes. Results point towards mixed and changing perceptions of MWL and the importance of fluctuating between MWL levels in daily life in terms of performances, perceptions, and wellbeing. These findings are captured in an apparent Cycle, which outside factors can disrupt, and we discuss these cycles in terms of personal informatics and work performance.

Understanding How People with Limited Mobility Use Multi-Modal Input,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517458,5,https://www.johannwentzel.ca/projects/msr-mmi/files/chi22-jwentzel-final.pdf,"
People with limited mobility often use multiple devices when interacting with computing systems, but little is known about the impact these multi-modal configurations have on daily computing use. A deeper understanding of the practices, preferences, obstacles, and workarounds associated with accessible multi-modal input can uncover opportunities to create more accessible computer applications and hardware. We explored how people with limited mobility use multi-modality through a three-part investigation grounded in the context of video games. First, we surveyed 43 people to learn about their preferred devices and configurations. Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 participants to understand their experiences and challenges with using, configuring, and discovering input setups. Lastly, we performed a systematic review of 74 YouTube videos to illustrate and categorize input setups and adaptations in-situ. We conclude with a discussion on how our findings can inform future accessibility research for current and emerging computing technologies.

To Flip or Not to Flip: Conformity Effect Across Cultures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519662,1,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/420611/Ferwerda_2022_To_flip_or_not_to_flip.pdf?sequence=1,"
 In group decision-making, we can frequently observe that an individual adapts their behavior or belief to fit in with the group’s majority opinion. This phenomenon has been widely observed to exist especially against an objectively correct answer—in face-to-face and online interaction alike. To a lesser extent, studies have investigated the conformity effect in settings based on personal opinions and feelings; thus, in settings where an objectively right or wrong answer does not exist. In such settings, the direction of conformity tends to play a role in whether an individual will conform. While cultural differences in conformity behavior have been observed repeatedly in settings with an objectively correct answer, the role of culture has not been explored yet for settings with subjective topics. Hence, the focus of this study is on how conformity develops across cultures for such cases. We developed an online experiment in which participants needed to reach a positive group consensus on adding a song to a music playlist. After seeing the group members’ ratings, the participants had the opportunity to revise their own. Our findings suggest that the willingness to flip to a positive outcome was far less than to a negative outcome. Overall, conformity behavior was far less pronounced for participants from the United Kingdom compared to participants from India.

Recommendations for visualization recommendations: Exploring preferences and priorities in public health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501891,6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01335,"
The promise of visualization recommendation systems is that analysts will be automatically provided with relevant and high-quality visualizations that will reduce the work of manual exploration or chart creation. However, little research to date has focused on what analysts value in the design of visualization recommendations. We interviewed 18 analysts in the public health sector and explored how they made sense of a popular in-domain dataset1 in service of generating visualizations to recommend to others. We also explored how they interacted with a corpus of both automatically- and manually-generated visualization recommendations, with the goal of uncovering how the design values of these analysts are reflected in current visualization recommendation systems. We find that analysts champion simple charts with clear takeaways that are nonetheless connected with existing semantic information or domain hypotheses. We conclude by recommending that visualization recommendation designers explore ways of integrating context and expectation into their systems.

Psychometric properties of the user experience questionnaire (UEQ),https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502098,4,,"
 User experience (UX) summarizes user perceptions and responses resulting from the interaction with a product, system, or service. The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) is one standardized instrument for measuring UX. With six scales, it identifies areas in which product improvements will have the highest impact. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability and validity of this questionnaire. The data of N = 1, 121 participants who interacted with one of 23 products indicated an acceptable to good reliability of all scales. The results show, however, that the scales were not independent of each other. Combining perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability to pragmatic aspects as well as novelty and stimulation to hedonic aspects of UX improved the model fit significantly. The systematic variations of product properties and correlations with the System Usability Scale (SUS) in a second experiment with N=499 participants supported the validity of these two factors. Practical implications of the results are discussed.

Towards sign language-centric design of ASL survey tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502047,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502047,"
Questionnaires are fundamental learning and research tools for gathering insights and information from individuals, and now can be created easily using online tools. However, existing resources for creating questionnaires are designed for written languages (e.g. English) and do not support sign languages (e.g. American Sign Language). Sign languages (SLs) have unique visual characteristics that do not fit into user interface paradigms designed for written, text-based languages. Through a series of formative studies with the ASL signing community, this paper takes steps towards understanding the viability, potential benefit, challenges, and user interest in SL-centric surveys, a novel approach for creating questionnaires that meet the needs of deaf individuals using sign languages, without obligatory reliance on a written language to complete a questionnaire.

Exploring Design Opportunities for Supporting Mental Wellbeing Among East Asian University Students in Canada,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517710,4,http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/edapt/papers/sien2022.pdf,"
 Amidst increasing reports of mental health problems in Canadian university students, those of Asian descent have particularly struggled to seek out services due to cultural barriers. Counselling practices have long noted that culture influences how mental health is perceived and treated, yet the design of mental health technologies is limited with respect to how users’ backgrounds influence usability and adoption. To identify inclusive design opportunities, we interviewed 20 East Asian university students in Canada. We found that they struggle to engage with technologies for mental health due to cultural stigma which have led them to prefer apps that support self-help though still valuing social help. We present inclusive design opportunities for mental health technologies that sensitively consider these challenges, including supporting learning opportunities with peers through storytelling and skill-sharing to promote literacy, empowerment, and advocacy for their own health. We conclude by discussing how universities can promote mental wellbeing more inclusively.

"SEACHI 2022 Symposium: Bringing Equality, Justice, and Access to HCI and UX Agenda in Southeast Asia Region",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3504031,2,https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8134&context=lkcsb_research,"
Southeast Asia that consists of eleven countries, has been proud of its way of life and rich culture and is generally happy to maintain its long comforting tradition. However, the region cannot deny that its diverse population and strategic location have become a center of attention for global players to invest in the region. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, digital transformation has become mandatory for any organizations or nations in Southeast Asia to consider. Through SEACHI (Southeast Asian CHI) Symposium, we aim to grow awareness in HCI and UX to improve the design and development of technology for a living and bring together the Southeast Asian academic researchers and industry practitioners. As HCI is maturing in Asia, we identified the remarkable growth and needs of HCI in the Southeast Asian community. In this symposium, we have several questions that we would like to answer: To what extent the HCI and UX that has been taught and practiced in Southeast Asia met the needs to support the digital transformation initiatives in the region; whether there has been any significant and proper contextualization of the HCI and UX fields; whether HCI and UX are still perceived as a Western mindset instead of a localized approach to make a difference in any projects; whether HCI and UX have become a standard norm in the digital product and design process and how HCI and UX players in Southeast Asia have worked together to create a unique ecosystem. Under the big conference theme “Equity, Justice and Access Commitments,” the symposium aims to bring about equal and fair access for anyone to exchange information and transfer knowledge in this multidisciplinary environment and multi-socioeconomic aspects of research and practice HCI and UX in Southeast Asia.

Will AI Image Synthesis Technology Help Constructivist Education at The Online Art Museum?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519788,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/t3iympb4sbam3pl4av6a4dlrki/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519788,"
 Motivated by the outbreak of COVID-19, museums have increased interests in online museum and online museum education. This study presents a way to use AI image synthesis technology for online art education guided by a constructivist design approach. An experiment was conducted to empirically test the effectiveness of AI-based art education in the online museum context. A total of 83 participants visited one of 3 different web-based art museums (i.e., AI image synthesis not applied vs. AI image synthesis applied with given photos vs. AI image synthesis applied with self-uploaded photos). Those who experienced the online museum with synthesized images using self-uploaded photos reported a higher level of motivation and satisfaction and to experience in a more constructivist way compared to other conditions.

Cultural influences on chinese citizens' adoption of digital contact tracing: A human infrastructure perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517572,4,,"
 Digital contact tracing is an ICT approach for controlling public health crises. It identifies users’ risk of infection based on their healthcare and travel information. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented digital contact tracing to contain the coronavirus outbreak. However, the adoption rates vary significantly across different countries. In this study, we investigate Chinese people’s adoption of digital contact tracing. We aim at finding the influence of Chinese culture on people’s attitudes and behaviors toward the technology. We interviewed 26 Chinese participants and used thematic analysis to interpret the data. Our findings showed that Chinese culture shaped citizens’ interactions with the digital contact tracing at multiple levels; driven by the culture, Chinese citizens accepted digital contact tracing and contributed to making digital contact tracing a socio-technical infrastructure of people’s daily lives. We also discuss such cultural influences with the growing literature of human infrastructure and crisis informatics.

TalkTive: a conversational agent using backchannels to engage older adults in neurocognitive disorders screening,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502005,4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08216,"
 Conversational agents (CAs) have the great potential in mitigating the clinicians’ burden in screening for neurocognitive disorders among older adults. It is important, therefore, to develop CAs that can be engaging, to elicit conversational speech input from older adult participants for supporting assessment of cognitive abilities. As an initial step, this paper presents research in developing the backchanneling ability in CAs in the form of a verbal response to engage the speaker. We analyzed 246 conversations of cognitive assessments between older adults and human assessors, and derived the categories of reactive backchannels (e.g. “hmm”) and proactive backchannels (e.g. “please keep going”). This is used in the development of TalkTive, a CA which can predict both timing and form of backchanneling during cognitive assessments. The study then invited 36 older adult participants to evaluate the backchanneling feature. Results show that proactive backchanneling is more appreciated by participants than reactive backchanneling.

Design and Evaluation of Hybrid Search for American Sign Language to English Dictionaries: Making the Most of Imperfect Sign Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501986,4,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10335691,"
Searching for the meaning of an unfamiliar sign-language word in a dictionary is difficult for learners, but emerging sign-recognition technology will soon enable users to search by submitting a video of themselves performing the word they recall. However, sign-recognition technology is imperfect, and users may need to search through a long list of possible results when seeking a desired result. To speed this search, we present a hybrid-search approach, in which users begin with a video-based query and then filter the search results by linguistic properties, e.g., handshape. We interviewed 32 ASL learners about their preferences for the content and appearance of the search-results page and filtering criteria. A between-subjects experiment with 20 ASL learners revealed that our hybrid search system outperformed a video-based search system along multiple satisfaction and performance metrics. Our findings provide guidance for designers of video-based sign-language dictionary search systems, with implications for other search scenarios.

Consumption experiences in the research process,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502001,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502001,"
 Data collection is often a laborious enterprise that forms part of the wider craft skill of doing research. In this essay, I try to understand whether parts of research processes in Human-Centred Computing (HCC) have been commodified, with a particular focus on data collection. If data collection has been commodified, do researchers act as producers or consumers in the process? And if researchers are consumers, has data collection become a consumption experience? If so, what are the implications of this? I explore these questions by considering the status of craft and consumption in the research process and by developing examples of consumption experiences. I note the benefits of commodity research artefacts, while highlighting the potentially deleterious effects consumption experiences could have on our ability to generate insights into the relations between people and technology. I finish the paper by relating consumption experiences to contemporary issues in HCC and lay out a programme of empirical work that would help answer some of the questions this paper raises.

Making Space for Cultural Infrastructure: The Breakdown and Maintenance Work of Independent Movie Theaters During Crisis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501840,4,https://scholar.archive.org/work/kw3b2ilmw5eatlymzpb6fpznsq/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501840,"
 Independent movie theaters (IMTs) are a part of the cultural infrastructure that offers shared spaces for patron communities to access, share, and engage with cultural artifacts. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMTs were mandated to shut down, resulting in unanticipated infrastructural breakdown. Drawing insights from a preliminary survey and interviews with staff members from 18 IMTs in the U.S., this paper attends to how this breakdown disrupted art and community engagement within patron communities. We investigate the sociotechnical practices of maintaining cultural infrastructure through 1) collaborating with community partners and external stakeholders, 2) screening films through online virtual cinema platforms, and 3) retaining community members through online platforms. Our work highlights the tensions and invisible human labor in this maintenance work. Together, this work intends to foreground cultural infrastructure and discuss how HCI can support and contribute to the design and oft-invisible maintenance of cultural infrastructure.

This work presents PITAS, a thin-sheet robotic material composed of a reversible phase transition actuating layer and a heating/sensing layer. The synthetic sheet material enables non-expert makers to create shape-changing devices that can locally or remotely convey physical information such as shape, color, texture and temperature changes. PITAS sheets can be manipulated into various 2D shapes or 3D geometries using subtractive fabrication methods such as laser, vinyl, or manual cutting or an optional additive 3D printing method for creating 3D objects. After describing the design of PITAS, this paper also describes a study conducted with thirteen makers to gauge the accessibility, design space, and limitations encountered when PITAS is used as a soft robotic material while designing physical information communication devices. Lastly, this work reports on the results of a mechanical and electrical evaluation of PITAS and presents application examples to demonstrate its utility.

'shishushurokkha': A transformative justice approach for combating child sexual abuse in bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517543,5,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIXCIIsepOCxUsyw9VqbZ6639suOGBCs/view,"
 The challenge of designing against child sexual abuse becomes more complicated in conservative societies where talking about sex is tabooed. Our mix-method study, comprised of an online survey, five FGDs, and 20 semi-structured interviews in Bangladesh, investigates the common nature, location, and time of the abuse, post-incident support, and possible combating strategies. Besides revealing important facts, our findings highlight the need of decentering the design from the victims (children and/or guardians) to the community. Hence, building on the theory of transformative justice, we prototyped and evaluated ‘ShishuShurokkha’ – an online tool that involves the whole community by allowing anonymous bystander reporting, visualizing case-maps, connecting with legal, medical, and social support, and raising awareness. The evaluation of ShishuShurokkha shows the promise for such a communal approach toward combating child sexual abuse, and highlights the needs for sincere involvement of the government, NGOs, the legal, educational, and religious services in this.

The role of intelligent personal assistants in migrant learners' willingness to communicate in English as a second language,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503818,3,https://oro.open.ac.uk/83191/1/83191.pdf,"
Modern approaches to second language (L2) pedagogy emphasise communicative competence as part of the language teaching goals. However, it has been observed that some learners are more willing to engage in L2 communication than others, and that this disposition may be affected by several variables that are not bounded to their linguistic competence. In the case of migrants, who are required to learn and use a second language to integrate into their new environment, there is a critical need for opportunities and resources to support their Willingness to Communicate (WTC) beyond the classroom. Intelligent personal assistants (IPA) offer a dynamic oral conversational opportunity in language learning that seems to have potential for improving language learners’ Willingness to Communicate. As part of this doctoral study, a conversational experience will be designed to bring together conversational and instructional principles that take into consideration the learners’ needs, their environment, and instructional activities to produce output in the English language. The research is of benefit to educators, and the HCI and UX community that is focused on the design or implementation of conversational experiences with IPAs in language learning.

Spinocchio: Understanding haptic-visual congruency of skin-slip in vr with a dynamic grip controller,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517724,3,,"
 This paper’s goal is to understand the haptic-visual congruency perception of skin-slip on the fingertips given visual cues in Virtual Reality (VR). We developed SpinOcchio (Spin for the spinning mechanism used, Occhio for the Italian word “eye”), a handheld haptic controller capable of rendering the thickness and slipping of a virtual object pinched between two fingers. This is achieved using a mechanism with spinning and pivoting disks that apply a tangential skin-slip movement to the fingertips. With SpinOcchio, we determined the baseline haptic discrimination threshold for skin-slip, and, using these results, we tested how haptic realism of motion and thickness is perceived with varying visual cues in VR. Surprisingly, the results show that in all cases, visual cues dominate over haptic perception. Based on these results, we suggest applications that leverage skin-slip and grip interaction, contributing further to realistic experiences in VR.

 Social wearables promise to augment and enhance social interactions. However, despite two decades of HCI research on wearables, we are yet to see widespread adoption of social wearables into everyday life. More in-situ investigations into the social dynamics and cultural practices afforded by wearing interactive technology are needed to understand the drivers and barriers to adoption. To this end, we study social wearables in the context of Nordic student culture and the students’ practice of adorning boiler suits. Through a co-creation process, we designed Digi Merkki, a personalised interactive clothing patch. In a two-week elicitation diary study, we captured how 16 students adopted Digi Merkki into their social practices. We found that Digi Merkki afforded a variety of social interaction strategies, including sharing, spamming, and stealing pictures, which supported meaning-making and community-building. Based on our findings, we articulate “Memetic Expression” as a strong concept for designing social wearables.

 Research on the emotional experience of playing videogames has increased in recent years, yet much of this work is focused on the hedonistic player experience (PX) commonly associated with the nebulous concept of ‘fun’ and positive affect. Researchers are increasingly paying more attention to the eudaimonic PX commonly associated with ‘appreciation’, mixed-affect and reflection. To further investigate eudaimonic PX we interviewed 24 games players about ‘significant or memorable emotional experiences’ from their games playing and used grounded theory to analyse their responses. This led to the construction of the concept of ‘emotional exploration’ which is used to help explain (i) why players would seek out a eudaimonic PX, (ii) how eudaimonic PX is constituted and (iii) how developers can design for a eudaimonic PX. We further make the case for the ‘eudaimonic gameplay experience’ to be realised as different and separate to pre-existing notions of eudaimonic entertainment.

A New Interactive Music System by Fusion of Melody Morphing and Body Movements,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519876,2,,"
 The fusion of music-information processing and human physical functions will enable new musical experiences to be created. We developed an interactive music system, which provides users with the experience of conducting a musical performance. This system converts music arranged using melody morphing method based on the general theory of tonal music into electrical muscle stimulation to control the body movements of multiple performers (e.g., musicians and dancers) via devices attached to the performers’ hands and feet. The melodies used in the system are divided into segments, and each segment has multiple variations of melodies. The user can interactively control the performers, thus the actual performance.

 Street harassment is a widespread problem that can constrain people’s freedom to enjoy public spaces safely, along with many other negative psychological impacts. However, very little research has looked at how immersive technology can help in addressing it. We conducted three studies to investigate the design decisions, ethical issues and efficacy of an immersive simulation of street harassment: an online design study (n=20), an interview study with experts working in the area (n=9), and a comparative lab study investigating design, ethics and efficacy (n=44). Our results deepen understanding of the design decisions that contribute to a realistic psychological experience, such as the effects of screen-based video vs passive VR vs interactive VR. They also highlight important ethical issues such as traumatisation and potential for victim blaming, and how they can be approached in an ethical manner. Finally, they provide insights into efficacy in terms of perceived usefulness, competence and empathy.

 We present a new approach to visualizing data that is well-suited for personal and casual applications. The idea is to map the data to another dataset that is already familiar to the user, and then rely on their existing knowledge to illustrate relationships in the data. We construct the map by preserving pairwise distances or by maintaining relative values of specific data attributes. This metaphorical mapping is very flexible and allows us to adapt the visualization to its application and target audience. We present several examples where we map data to different domains and representations. This includes mapping data to cat images, encoding research interests with neural style transfer and representing movies as stars in the night sky. Overall, we find that although metaphors are not as accurate as the traditional techniques, they can help design engaging and personalized visualizations.

Why Did You/I Read but Not Reply? IM Users' Unresponded-to Read-receipt Practices and Explanations of Them,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517496,4,,"
 We investigate instant-messaging (IM) users’ sense-making and practices around read-receipts: a feature of IM apps for supporting the awareness of turn-taking, i.e., whether a message recipient has read a message. Using a grounded-theory approach, we highlight the importance of five contextual factors – situational, relational, interactional, conversational, and personal – that shape the variety of IM users’ sense-making about read-receipts and strategies for utilizing them in different settings. This approach yields a 21-part typology comprising five types of senders’ speculation about why their messages with read-receipts have not been answered; eight types of recipients’ causes/reasons behind such non-response; and four types of senders’ and recipients’ subsequent strategies, respectively. Mismatches between senders’ speculations about un-responded-to read-receipted messages (URRMs) and recipients’ self-reported explanations are also discussed as sources of communicative friction. The findings reveal that, beyond indicating turn-taking, read-receipts have been leveraged as a strategic tool for various purposes in interpersonal relations.

Not just a preference: Reducing biased decision-making on dating websites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517587,3,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10366303,"
 As dating websites are becoming an essential part of how people meet intimate and romantic partners, it is vital to design these systems to be resistant to, or at least do not amplify, bias and discrimination. Instead, the results of our online experiment with a simulated dating website, demonstrate that popular dating website design choices, such as the user of the swipe interface (swiping in one direction to indicate a like and in the other direction to express a dislike) and match scores, resulted in people racially biases choices even when they explicitly claimed not to have considered race in their decision-making. This bias was significantly reduced when the order of information presentation was reversed such that people first saw substantive profile information related to their explicitly-stated preferences before seeing the profile name and photo. These results indicate that currently-popular design choices amplify people’s implicit biases in their choices of potential romantic partners, but the effects of the implicit biases can be reduced by carefully redesigning the dating website interfaces.

Towards Conversationally Intelligent Dialog Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519842,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/h3aeqoaqezenlpagtfkf6umove/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519842,"
Spoken dialog systems, lacking the means to address the complex phenomena of spontaneous speech and conversational dynamics, force users into a constrained mode of dialog that resembles text-based interaction more closely than spoken conversation. Turn-taking is simplified and discourse-related information is lost, as discourse markers are largely ignored and prosodic information is not captured or utilized. We hypothesize that incorporating a few of these key conversational phenomena at specific points in a dialog will reduce cognitive load in spoken human-computer interaction and expand the potential application areas of dialog systems to tasks requiring more complex interactions. In this paper, we describe our approach to adding conversational intelligence to dialog systems and our work to date validating the hypothesis that adding conversational intelligence to existing dialog systems will significantly reduce users’ cognitive load.

When people engage in urban exploration, the tool they are most likely to use today is a mobile phone. In this paper, we present observations of users’ “home” and “away” conducted to refine our understanding of situational Point-of-Interest (POI) needs. Our findings suggest three distinct categories of situations in which users seek POI information: On-the-spot, Refining plans, and Moments of boredom. Based on the similarities and differences of these three situations in five observed underlying constraints – distance of interest, engagement threshold, ambiguity of the search, profile matching, and other imperative constraints, we derive implications for designing and ranking POIs for a Situational Recommender. To further access our concept, we designed and prototyped Situational Recommender by providing an interactional representation of the situation, and ran a Wizard-of-Oz concept validation study. Our results suggest that participants understood the concept without much effort and appreciated its usefulness.

Speech is inappropriate in many situations, limiting when voice control can be used. Most unvoiced speech text entry systems can not be used while on-the-go due to movement artifacts. Using a dental retainer with capacitive touch sensors, SilentSpeller tracks tongue movement, enabling users to type by spelling words without voicing. SilentSpeller achieves an average 97% character accuracy in offline isolated word testing on a 1164-word dictionary. Walking has little effect on accuracy; average offline character accuracy was roughly equivalent on 107 phrases entered while walking (97.5%) or seated (96.5%). To demonstrate extensibility, the system was tested on 100 unseen words, leading to an average 94% accuracy. Live text entry speeds for seven participants averaged 37 words per minute at 87% accuracy. Comparing silent spelling to current practice suggests that SilentSpeller may be a viable alternative for silent mobile text entry.

Characteristics of People Who Engage in Online Harassing Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519812,1,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10343477,"
 Conflict in online spaces can often lead to behaviors that may be categorized as “harassment.” We asked 307 U.S. adults to self-report if they have ever engaged in aggressive online conflict. Using logistic regressions, we examine what psychosocial characteristics predict which users would report engaging in behaviors that are commonly labeled as “harassment.” We find that psychological factors such as impulsivity, reactive aggression, and premeditated aggression distinguish those who never thought of, those who only imagined, and those who carried out harassing behavior. Demographic factors other than age do not have significance, contrary to the results of prior studies. Design interventions that address propensities to perpetrate harassment might reduce harm but also raise ethical and moral concerns about the nature of harassment and the disposition toward it.

NeurTEx: A neural framework for template extraction from flat images,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519718,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/mjcrs7v2zvdhbl7rfmcemeospm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519718,"
 With the increasing demands of digital creation, a creative user often starts by looking for inspirational resources online. Once they find such inspirations, they recreate certain design elements using tracing-like applications to internalize the design for their purpose. We aim to accelerate this process by extracting key semantics from an inspirational image, and converting it into a ready-to-use template using a multimodal information extraction setup. We propose NeurTEx, a holistic algorithm that takes an inspirational banner image as input and extracts multimodal design semantics: layout, text elements (actual text along with the font style), image elements (including semantics like logos and background/foreground objects) and shapes. Our technique uses a segmentation framework followed by a region based depth-first search to extract and identify different elements and their semantics. We process these regions to extract finer details such as font styles, texts and logos. We believe that such fine–grained semantics would accelerate the design process for a creator helping them rapidly adapt designs from inspirations for their requirements. With the help of metric-based and human survey based evaluations, we not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to extract the style & design components from an inspirational image but also illustrate how these extractions can accelerate the creation process thus aiding novices and professionals alike.

Co-existing With a Drone: Using Virtual Reality to Investigate the Effect of the Drone's Height and Cover Story on Proxemic Behaviours,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519750,2,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/267516/1/267516.pdf,"
 While a growing body of literature has begun to examine proxemics in light of human–robot interactions, it is unclear how insights gained from human–human or human–robot interaction (HRI) apply during human–drone interactions (HDI). Understanding why and how people locate themselves around drones is thus critical to ensure drones are socially acceptable. In this paper, we present a proxemic user study (N=45) in virtual reality focusing on 1) the impact of the drone’s height and 2) the type of cover story used to introduce the drone (framing) on participants’ proxemic preferences. We found that the flying height has a statistically significant effect on the preferred interpersonal distance, whereas no evidence was found related to how the drone was framed. While results also highlight the value of using Virtual Reality for HDI experiments, further research must be carried out to investigate how these findings translate from the virtual to the real world.

Co-Orb: Fostering Remote Workplace Gratitude with IoT Technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3514488,2,,"
 While gratitude in the workplace is essential for group well-being and teamwork efficiency, showing gratitude to coworkers becomes difficult under remote work settings, which is prevalent with the ongoing pandemic. Our research revealed that in remote workspaces, people often feel less emotionally touched by the appreciation messages sent by coworkers via text-based communication due to the lack of in-person interaction. In addition, it has become more challenging for coworkers to express their appreciation in a sincere and timely manner. To solve this problem, we designed Co-Orb, an IoT desktop orb that is connected to people’s work communication app and lights up with a customized emoji when a thank-you message is received from co-workers. By creating a multi-sensory experience that brings thank-you messages beyond screens, we aim to make it more enjoyable for users to express and receive appreciation in a remote workplace, thereby promoting better work relationships.

 As more individuals consider permanently working from home, the online labor market continues to grow as an alternative working environment. While the flexibility and autonomy of these online gigs attracts many workers, success depends critically upon self-management and workers’ efficient allocation of scarce resources. To achieve this, freelancers may develop alternative work strategies, employing highly standardized schedules and communication patterns while taking on large work volumes, or engaging in smaller numbers of jobs whilst tailoring their activities to build relationships with individual employers. In this study, we consider this contrast in relation to worker communication patterns. We demonstrate the heterogeneous effects of standardization versus personalization across different stages of a project and examine the relative impact on job acquisition, project completion, and earnings. Our findings can inform the design of platforms and various worker support tools for the gig economy.

Exploring Technical Reasoning in Digital Tool Use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501877,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501877,"
 The Technical Reasoning hypothesis in cognitive neuroscience posits that humans engage in physical tool use by reasoning about mechanical interactions among objects. By modeling the use of objects as tools based on their abstract properties, this theory explains how tools can be re-purposed beyond their assigned function. This paper assesses the relevance of Technical Reasoning to digital tool use. We conducted an experiment with 16 participants that forced them to re-purpose commands to complete a text layout task. We analyzed self-reported scores of creative personality and experience with text editing, and found a significant association between re-purposing performance and creativity, but not with experience. Our results suggest that while most participants engaged in Technical Reasoning to re-purpose digital tools, some experienced “functional fixedness.” This work contributes Technical Reasoning as a theoretical model for the design of digital tools.

Tisane: Authoring Statistical Models via Formal Reasoning from Conceptual and Data Relationships,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501888,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501888,"
Proper statistical modeling incorporates domain theory about how concepts relate and details of how data were measured. However, data analysts currently lack tool support for recording and reasoning about domain assumptions, data collection, and modeling choices in an integrated manner, leading to mistakes that can compromise scientific validity. For instance, generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) help answer complex research questions, but omitting random effects impairs the generalizability of results. To address this need, we present Tisane, a mixed-initiative system for authoring generalized linear models with and without mixed-effects. Tisane introduces a study design specification language for expressing and asking questions about relationships between variables. Tisane contributes an interactive compilation process that represents relationships in a graph, infers candidate statistical models, and asks follow-up questions to disambiguate user queries to construct a valid model. In case studies with three researchers, we find that Tisane helps them focus on their goals and assumptions while avoiding past mistakes.

Public views on digital covid-19 certificates: A mixed methods user study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502066,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502066,"
 The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments worldwide to introduce various measures restricting human activity and mobility. Along with the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and rapid testing, socio-technological solutions such as digital COVID-19 certificates have been considered as a strategy to lessen these restrictions and allow the resumption of routine activities. Using a mixed-methods approach – a survey (n=1008) and 27 semi-structured interviews – this study explores the attitudes of residents in the Republic of Ireland towards the idea of introducing digital COVID-19 certificates. We examine the topics of acceptability, fairness, security and privacy of COVID-related personal data, and practical considerations for implementation. Our study reveals the conditional and contextual nature of the acceptability of digital certificates, identifying specific factors that affect it, associated data practices, and related public concerns and expectations of such technologies.

eParticipation for Supporting Societal Participation Self-efficacy and Lowering the Thresholds of Societal Participation: Case Virtual Council,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503578,1,https://www.iikka.org/publ6_eparticipation_selfefficacy.pdf,"
While eParticipation platforms have been developed extensively, there is a lack of insight into how they support societal participation. People's beliefs in their capabilities are a relevant component in human action, also affecting the motivation to participate. In this paper, we report the results of a study on the possibilities of an eParticipation platform to a) enhance the users’ self-efficacy in the context of societal participation, and b) lower the threshold of societal participation. Altogether, 34 young people from various backgrounds participated in Virtual Council field tests to collaborate on the Climate Change Act in Finland. The results suggest that eParticipation platforms can enhance the societal participation self-efficacy of youths that initially have less experience participating in societal issues. Furthermore, the threshold of participation can be lowered after using the eParticipation platform. The paper adds to the growing discussion on connections between youths use of digital services and societal participation.

Identifying an aurally distinct phrase set for text entry techniques,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501897,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501897,"
 In the last decade, interest in accessible and eyes-free text entry has continued to grow. However, little research has been done to explore the feasibility of using audibly distinct phrases for text entry tasks. To better understand whether preexisting phrases used in text entry research are sufficiently distinct for eyes-free text entry tasks, we used Microsoft’s and Apple’s desktop text-to-speech systems to generate all 500 phrases from MacKenzie and Soukoreff’s set [32] using the default male and female voices. We then asked 392 participants recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to transcribe the generated audio clips. We report participant transcription errors and present the 96 phrases that were observed with no comprehension errors. These phrases were further tested with 80 participants who identified as low-vision and/or blind recruited through Twitter. We contribute the 92 phrases that were observed to maintain no comprehension errors across both experiments.

Meander Coil++: A body-scale wireless power transmission using safe-to-body and energy-efficient transmitter coil,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502119,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502119,"
 Wearable devices for life-logging and healthcare have been studied, but the need for frequent charging imposes inconvenience for long-term use. Integrating textile-based wireless chargers (i.e., coil) into clothing enables sustainable wearable computing by charging the on-body devices in use. However, the electromagnetic field generated by conventional coil chargers strongly interferes with human body, and the high resistance of conductive threads leads to inefficient power delivery. This paper presents Meander Coil++, enabling safe, energy-efficient, and body-scale wireless power delivery. Meander Coil++ uses a wiring pattern that suppresses electromagnetic exposure to the human body without compromising power delivery performance and a liquid-metal-based low-loss conductive cord. With these advancements, Meander Coil++ transmits a few watts of power to on-body devices at 25% DC-to-DC efficiency while complying with international safety guidelines regarding electromagnetic exposure. We envision Meander Coil++ can maintain multiple devices on body for weeks beyond the confines of their small battery capacity.

Understanding the situated practices of school technology leaders in the early stages of educational technology adoption,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502120,3,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10149776/1/chi22-298_Ibrahim.pdf,"
School-driven technological innovation has the potential to positively impact on classroom practice, yet it can also be disrupted by incompatibilities between the existing school ecology and new educational technologies. To help mitigate this disruption a particular staff member often takes on a facilitative leadership role to champion new technology initiatives. However little is known about how this technology leader role impacts on the adoption of new technologies in the classroom. Taking a situated lens, we embarked on a multiple case study of four schools who were aiming to adopt a new literacy game in the classroom. Through interviews with technology leaders and fieldnotes from our site observations, we systematically analysed their actions and concerns over two academic terms. This highlighted an overwhelming concern with managing the material dimension of the technology, teacher agency and division of labour and mechanisms for communication and monitoring. Our findings raise important considerations for HCI researchers seeking to embed their technologies into practice alongside recommendations for supporting leaders tasked with coordinating this process.

Aware: intuitive device activation using prosody for natural voice interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517687,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zixiong-Su-3/publication/360263209_Aware_Intuitive_Device_Activation_Using_Prosody_for_Natural_Voice_Interactions/links/63f0ea3a51d7af054036eb36/Aware-Intuitive-Device-Activation-Using-Prosody-for-Natural-Voice-Interactions.pdf,"
 Voice interactive devices often use keyword spotting for device activation. However, this approach suffers from misrecognition of keywords and can respond to keywords not intended for calling the device (e.g., ”You can ask Alexa about it.”), causing accidental device activations. We propose a method that leverages prosodic features to differentiate calling/not-calling voices (F1 score: 0.869), allowing devices to respond only when called upon to avoid misactivation. As a proof of concept, we built a prototype smart speaker called Aware that allows users to control the device activation by speaking the keyword in specific prosody patterns. These patterns are chosen to represent people’s natural calling/not-calling voices, which are uncovered in a study to collect such voices and investigate their prosodic difference. A user study comparing Aware with Amazon Echo shows Aware can activate more correctly (F1 score 0.93 vs. 0.56) and is easy to learn and use.

Conversational interaction, for example through chatbots, is well-suited to enable automated health coaching tools to support self-management and prevention of chronic diseases. However, chatbots in health are predominantly scripted or rule-based, which can result in a stagnant and repetitive user experience in contrast with more dynamic, data-driven chatbots in other domains. Consequently, little is known about the tradeoffs of pursuing data-driven approaches for health chatbots. We examined multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to enable micro-coaching dialogs in nutrition — brief coaching conversations related to specific meals, to support achievement of nutrition goals — and compared, reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and scripted approaches for dialog management. While the data-driven RL chatbot succeeded in shorter, more efficient dialogs, surprisingly the simplest, scripted chatbot was rated as higher quality, despite not fulfilling its task as consistently. These results highlight tensions between scripted and more complex, data-driven approaches for chatbots in health.

 Many daily tasks rely on accurately identifying and distinguishing between different colours. However, these tasks can be frustrating and potentially dangerous for people with Colour Vision Deficiency (CVD). Despite prior work exploring how pattern overlays on top of colours can support people with CVD, the solutions were often unintuitive or required significant training to become proficient. We address this problem by creating two new colour patterns (ColourIconizer, ColourMix). We evaluated these patterns against a previously published colour pattern (ColourMeters) using an online evaluation with three new colour identification tasks (Selection Task, Transition Task, Sorting Task). ColourMeters helped with the Transition Task, but struggled with the Selection and Sorting Tasks. Conversely, ColourIconizer helped with the Selection and Sorting Tasks but struggled to help on the Transition Task. ColourMix provided general assistance on all tasks. Our combined results help inform and improve the design of future colour patterns.

 In this work, we present a case study on an Instagram Data Donation (IGDD) project, which is a user study and web-based platform for youth (ages 13-21) to donate and annotate their Instagram data with the goal of improving adolescent online safety. We employed human-centered design principles to create an ecologically valid dataset that will be utilized to provide insights from teens’ private social media interactions and train machine learning models to detect online risks. Our work provides practical insights and implications for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers that collect and study social media data to address sensitive problems relating to societal good.

In this paper, we investigate the use of shape-change for interaction with sound zones. A core challenge to designing interaction with sound zone systems is to support users’ understanding of the unique spatial properties of sound zones. Shape-changing interfaces present new opportunities for addressing this. We present a structured investigation into this. We leveraged the knowledge of 12 sound experts to define a set of basic shapes and movements. Then, we constructed a prototype and conducted an elicitation study with 17 novice users, investigating the experience of these shapes and movements. Our findings show that physical visualizations of sound zones can be useful in supporting users’ experience of sound zones. We present a framework of 4 basic pattern categories that prompt different sound zone experiences and outline further research directions for shape-change in supporting sound zone interaction.

People share photos on Social Networks Sites, but at the same time want to keep some photo content private. This tension between sharing and privacy has led researchers to try to solve this problem, but without considering users’ needs. To fill this gap, we present a novel interface that expands privacy options beyond recipient-control (R). Our system can also flag sensitive content (C) and obfuscate (O) it (RCO). We then describe the results of a two-step experiment that compares RCO with two alternative interfaces - (R) which mimics existing SNS privacy options by providing recipient control, and a system that in addition to recipient control also flags sensitive content (RC). Results suggest RC performs worse than R regarding perceived privacy risks, willingness to share, and user experience. However, RCO, which provides obfuscation options, restores these metrics to the same levels as R. We conclude by providing insights on system implementation.

 Even entrepreneurs whose businesses are not technological (e.g., handmade goods) need to be able to use a wide range of computing technologies in order to achieve their business goals. In this paper, we follow a participatory action research approach and collaborate with various stakeholders at an entrepreneurial co-working space to design “Tech Help Desk”, an on-going technical service for entrepreneurs. Our model for technical assistance is strategic, in how it is designed to fit the context of local entrepreneurs, and responsive, in how it prioritizes emergent needs. From our engagements with 19 entrepreneurs and support personnel, we reflect on the challenges with existing technology support for non-technological entrepreneurs. Our work highlights the importance of ensuring technological support services can adapt based on entrepreneurs’ ever-evolving priorities, preferences and constraints. Furthermore, we find technological support services should maintain broad technical support for entrepreneurs’ long tail of computing challenges.

 Virtual avatars are widely used for collaborating in virtual environments. Yet, often these avatars lack expressiveness to determine a state of mind. Prior work has demonstrated effective usage of determining emotions and animated lip movement through analyzing mere audio tracks of spoken words. To provide this information on a virtual avatar, we created a natural audio data set consisting of 17 audio files from which we then extracted the underlying emotion and lip movement. To conduct a pilot study, we developed a prototypical system that displays the extracted visual parameters and then maps them on a virtual avatar while playing the corresponding audio file. We tested the system with 5 participants in two conditions: (i) while seeing the virtual avatar only an audio file was played. (ii) In addition to the audio file, the extracted facial visual parameters were displayed on the virtual avatar. Our results suggest the validity of using additional visual parameters in the avatars’ face as it helps to determine emotions. We conclude with a brief discussion on the outcomes and their implications on future work.

 Decision-making algorithms can be obscure and fast-moving. This is especially the case in the context of the algorithm that mediates the work of Deliveroo riders. Forming a critical part of the food delivery platform, the algorithm’s obscurity and shifting nature is a part of its design. In this paper we argue that adapting usability techniques like the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) may provide one way to better understand algorithms and platform work. Though there are many methods to understand algorithms like this, asking people about negative or positive interactions with them and what they think provoked them can produce fruitful avenues for HCI research into the impacts of platforms on gig-economy work. We argue that despite the results being an assumption, assumptions from the algorithmically managed are interesting materials to challenge the researchers’ own assumptions about their context, and to, therefore, better scope out contexts and iterate future research.

Sound zone technology allows multiple simultaneous sound experiences for multiple people in the same room without interference. However, given the inherent invisible and intangible nature of sound zones, it is unclear how to communicate the position and size of sound zones to users. This paper compares two visualisation techniques; absolute visualisation, relational visualisation, as well as a baseline condition without visualisations. In a within-subject experiment (N = 33), we evaluated these techniques for effectiveness and efficiency across four representative tasks. Our findings show that the absolute and relational visualisation techniques increase effectiveness in multi-user tasks but not in single-user tasks. The efficiency for all tasks was improved using visualisations. We discuss the potential of visualisations for sound zones and highlight future research opportunities for sound zone interaction.

 Navigating large-scale virtual spaces is a major challenge in Virtual Reality (VR) applications due to real-world spatial limitations. Walking-in-place (WIP) locomotion solutions may provide a natural approach for VR use cases that require locomotion to share similar qualities with walking in real-life. However, there is limited knowledge on the range of experiences across common WIP methods to inform the design of usable WIP solutions using consumer-accessible components. This paper contributes to this knowledge via a user study with 40 participants that experienced several easy-to-setup WIP methods in a VR commuting simulation. A nuanced understanding of cybersickness and exertion relationships and walking affordances based on different tracker setups were among the findings derived from a corroborated analysis of think-aloud, interview, and observational data, supplemented with self-reports of VR sickness, presence and flow. Practical design insights were then constructed along the dimensions of cybersickness, affordances, space and user interfaces.

 The integration of various technologies with our daily lives, such as smartwatches, smartphones, smart TVs, etc. has proven beneficial. However, the HCI community is still in search for more intuitive text entry methods for smart devices. In this study, we explore a new text entry method—AcousticType for smart devices where a smartwatch is leveraged to infer what a user is typing on a physical keyboard employing the acoustic signals as a secondary input mechanism. AcousticType employs four modules: Noise Cancelling, Keystroke Detection, Key Identification and Word Correction. Our results show AcousticType recovers up to 98% of the typed text. We also showed that utilizing the noise cancellation, AcousticType is robust to the changes in the environment, which further boosts the practicality. The findings are promising and call for further investigation into new types of text entry methods that utilize acoustic signals to cope with the usability issues in smart devices.

 Home assistants are becoming a widespread product, but they mostly come as a compact device and offer very few customization and personalization features, which often leads to dissatisfaction. With the technological advancements, these systems are becoming more adaptable to the users’ needs and can better imitate a human personality. To achieve that efficiently, understanding how different users envision their desired assistant is crucial. To identify people’s customization and personalization preferences and their desired personality for a home assistant, we designed a set of storyboards depicting a variety of possible features in a domestic setting and conducted a user study (), including a series of semi-structured interviews. Our quantitative results suggest that users prefer an agent which is highly agreeable and has higher conscientiousness and emotional stability. Furthermore, we discuss users’ customization and personalization preferences for a home assistant, which could be considered when designing the future generation of home assistants.

Sports such as rock climbing can improve feelings of skillfulness, autonomy, and confidence for people with low or no vision as they strive to overcome environmental and personal challenges. In this late-breaking work we present Climb-o-Vision, a novel sensory substitution software that utilizes YOLOv5 computer vision object-detection architecture, to aid navigation for rock climbers with visual impairments. Climb-o-Vision uses commercially available and cost-effective hardware to detect, track, and convert climbing hold spatial locations on to the surface of the tongue, via an electrotactile tongue interface. Preliminary testing of the device highlights the possibility of using sensory substitution as a sporting aid for people with visual impairments. Furthermore, it demonstrates the potential for adapting and improving current sensory substitution systems by employing computer vision techniques to filter useful task-specific information to users with visual impairments.

Putting the Waz on Social Media: Infrastructuring Online Islamic Counterpublic through Digital Sermons in Bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502006,3,,"
 While the presence of religious content is rapidly increasing over digital media, the HCI literature on digital media production has remained mostly limited by its focus on secular contents and analyses. Hence, the production, politics, and impact of such religious videos from the Global South have remained understudied in HCI. In this paper, we shed light on this topic through our nine-month-long ethnographic study on the production, sharing, and consumption of Islamic sermon videos (locally known as Waz) in Bangladesh. We report how faith, informal learning, local collaboration, creativity, and care play crucial roles in creating Islamic sermon videos and their proliferation online. We discuss how the sermon videos create a religious counterpublic in Bangladesh. We further discuss how such faith-based media production makes important lessons pertinent to the national grassroots politics in the Global South, politics of social media platforms, and HCI4D scholarship.

Understanding and modeling viewers' first impressions with images in online medical crowdfunding campaigns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501830,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/gcvy5xvzu5h3vprcvb2moqwpsa/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501830,"
 Online medical crowdfunding campaigns (OMCCs) help patients seek financial support. First impressions (FIs) of an OMCC, including perceived empathy, credibility, justice, impact, and attractiveness, could affect viewers’ donation decisions. Images play a crucial role in manifesting FIs, and it is beneficial for fundraisers to understand how viewers may judge their selected images for OMCCs beforehand. This work proposes a data-driven approach to assessing whether an OMCC image conveys appropriate FIs. We first crowdsource viewers’ perception of OMCC images. Statistical analysis confirms that agreement on all five dimensions of FIs exists, and these FIs positively correlate with donation intention. We compute image content, color, texture, and composition features, then analyze the correlation between these visual features and FIs. We further predict FIs based on these features, and the best model achieves an overall F1-score of 0.727. Finally, we discuss how our insights could benefit fundraisers and possible ethical concerns.

Vrysmart: a framework for embedding smart devices in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519717,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Akhmajon-Makhsadov/publication/360283048_VRySmart_a_Framework_for_Embedding_Smart_Devices_in_Virtual_Reality/links/62b2f4956ec05339cc9a908a/VRySmart-a-Framework-for-Embedding-Smart-Devices-in-Virtual-Reality.pdf,"
 As immersive virtual experiences find their way into our living room entertainment, they are becoming part of our daily technological consumption. However, state-of-the-art virtual reality (VR) remains disconnected from other digital devices in our environment, such as smartphones or tablets. As context switches between acting in the virtual environment and resolving external notifications negatively influence immersion, we look towards integrating smart devices into virtual experiences. To this aim, we present the VRySmart framework. Through either optical marker tracking or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), embedded smart devices can be used as VR controllers with different levels of integration while their content is incorporated into the virtual context to support the plausibility of the illusion. To investigate user impressions, we conducted a study (N = 10) where participants used a smartphone in four different virtual scenarios. Participants positively assessed smart device usage in VR. We conclude by framing implications for future work.

QuAD: Deep-Learning Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis with Affinity Diagrams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519863,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/iz6y2unlubbpnkglqdy2z25yvi/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519863,"
 Affinity diagramming is an effective and efficient method for forming nuanced interpretations of wide-ranging, unstructured qualitative data; however, this method does not scale well to large data sets. We propose a novel affinity diagramming system, called Qualitative Affinity Diagrammer (QuAD) that leverages computer-generated suggestions using deep learning to address the scalability of the diagramming process. QuAD features automatic grouping suggestions to jump-start the affinity diagramming process and provides grouping suggestions throughout the diagramming process to reduce sifting through notes. In this paper, we present a prototype of QuAD that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Girvan-Newman to generate grouping suggestions. This work is the first step towards creating a powerful tool for assisting in the analysis of large qualitative data sets in a variety of contexts, including human-computer interaction.

The polyvocality of online COVID-19 vaccine narratives that invoke medical racism,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501892,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501892,"
 Vaccine hesitancy has always been a public health concern, and anti-vaccine campaigns that proliferate disinformation have gained traction across the US in the last 25 years. The demographics of resistance are varied, with health, religious, and, increasingly, political concerns cited as reasons. With the COVID-19 pandemic igniting the fastest development of vaccines to date, mis- and disinformation about them have become inflammatory, with campaigning allegedly including racial targeting. Through a primarily qualitative investigation, this study inductively examines a large online vaccine discussion space that invokes references to the unethical Tuskegee Syphilis Study to understand how tactics of racial targeting of Black Americans might appear publicly. We find that such targeting is entangled with a genuine discussion about medical racism and vaccine hesitancy. Across 12 distinct voices that address race, medical racism, and vaccines, we discuss how mis- and disinformation sit alongside accurate information in a “polyvocal” space.

Uplifting Interviews in Social Science with Individual Data Visualization: the case of Music Listening,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503553,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06809,"
 Collecting accurate and fine-grain information about the music people like, dislike and actually listen to has long been a challenge for sociologists. As millions of people now use online music streaming services, research can build upon the individual listening history data that are collected by these platforms. Individual interviews, in particular, can benefit from such data, by allowing the interviewers to immerse themselves in the musical universe of consenting respondents, and thus ask them contextualized questions and get more precise answers. Designing a visual exploration tool allowing such an immersion is however difficult, because of the volume and heterogeneity of the listening data, the unequal “visual literacy” of the prospective users, or the interviewers’ potential lack of knowledge of the music listened to by the respondents. In this case study we discuss the design and evaluation of such a tool. Designed with social scientists, its purpose is to help them in preparing and conducting semi-structured interviews that address various aspects of the listening experience. It was evaluated during thirty interviews with consenting users of a streaming platform in France.

Grand challenges for personal informatics and AI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503718,1,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2007z86v/qt2007z86v.pdf,"
Increasing availability of personal data opened new possibilities for technologies that support individuals’ reflection, increase their self-awareness, and inform their future choices. Personal informatics, chiefly concerned with investigating individuals’ engagement with personal data, has become an area of active research within Human-Computer Interaction. However, more recent research has argued that personal informatics solutions often place high demands on individuals and require knowledge, skills, and time for engaging with personal data. New advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the cognitive burden of personal informatics and identify meaningful trends using analytical engines. Furthermore, introducing ML and AI can enable systems that provide more direct support for action, for example through predictions and recommendations. However, there are many open questions as to the design of personal informatics technologies that incorporate ML and AI. In this workshop, we will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers in personal informatics, ML, and AI to outline the design space for intelligent personal informatics solutions and develop an agenda for future research in this area.

The Normal Natural Troubles of Virtual Reality in Mixed-Reality Performances,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502139,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3502139,"
 Performing with technology is a complex and challenging task. Artists who use novel technologies, such as Virtual Reality, have to develop strategies of monitoring, maintenance, and recovery from errors with as minimal impact on the ongoing performance as possible. In this paper we draw on two case studies of mixed-reality performances and document strategies of Stage Managing VR Performance, Choreographing for Cables, Consistency & Charging, Improvising Interventions, and Priming Participants. We discuss how these practices expose areas ripe with potential for tool development, and how they can also be used to inform the design of interaction with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things.

 Mobile video-based learning attracts many learners with its mobility and ease of access. However, most lectures are designed for desktops. Our formative study reveals mobile learners’ two major needs: more readable content and customizable video design. To support mobile-optimized learning, we present FitVid, a system that provides responsive and customizable video content. Our system consists of (1) an adaptation pipeline that reverse-engineers pixels to retrieve design elements (e.g., text, images) from videos, leveraging deep learning with a custom dataset, which powers (2) a UI that enables resizing, repositioning, and toggling in-video elements. The content adaptation improves the guideline compliance rate by 24% and 8% for word count and font size. The content evaluation study (n=198) shows that the adaptation significantly increases readability and user satisfaction. The user study (n=31) indicates that FitVid significantly improves learning experience, interactivity, and concentration. We discuss design implications for responsive and customizable video adaptation.

Development and preliminary validation of the enjoyment questionnaire and the sources of enjoyment questionnaire,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519819,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/oaowl7on5jc4jhrmbo2gzbvwoy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519819,"
Building on the sources of enjoyment identified by Schaffer and Fang's card sorting study, we describe the development of two new measures for player experience research, the Enjoyment Questionnaire (EQ) and the Sources of Enjoyment Questionnaire (SoEQ). Among other sources, the EQ and SoEQ draw on flow theory, self-determination theory, and desire fulfillment theory. The EQ assesses digital game enjoyment and the SoEQ assesses 38 sources of enjoyment in digital games, including Humor, Relaxation, Savoring, Optimal Pacing, Optimal Variety, Social Responsibility, Task Significance, and Clear Task Purpose. The scale was validated with a survey of 564 participants. Results demonstrated the EQ and each subscale of the SoEQ have both construct validity and internal consistency. Results also provided evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. The EQ and SoEQ are useful and reliable tools for the study of digital game enjoyment and its sources.

SLNOM: Exploring the sound of mastication as a behavioral change strategy for rapid eating regulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519755,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yang-Chen-292/publication/360408793_SLNOM_Exploring_the_sound_of_mastication_as_a_behavioral_change_strategy_for_rapid_eating_regulation/links/628b3b5539fa21703167728c/SLNOM-Exploring-the-sound-of-mastication-as-a-behavioral-change-strategy-for-rapid-eating-regulation.pdf,"
Rapid eating is linked to numerous health problems, such as obesity and gastritis. In this study, we explore the possibility of using mastication sound as a novel behavior change strategy to subtly regulate rapid eating behavior. In particular, we present SLNOM, a system that can automatically detect chewing behavior using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and slow down the playback speed of real-time mastication sounds to implicitly modify eating behavior. Two empirical studies have been conducted to determine: 1) the threshold of sound volume and speed without user perception; and 2) the feasibility and effectiveness of SLNOM in changing eating behavior using a Wizard of Oz study. The result indicated that manipulation of chewing sound could modulate eating rate, bite size without cognitive and behavioral effort. We discussed how cognitive science could explain these findings and suggested how future eating interventions can be designed to take advantage of current exploration.

“It was hard to find the words”: Using an Autoethnographic Diary Study to Understand the Difficulties of Smart Home Cyber Security Practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503577,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09035,"
 This study considers how well an autoethnographic diary study helps as a method to explore why families might struggle in the application of strong and cohesive cyber security measures within the smart home. Combining two human-computer interaction (HCI) research methods — the relatively unstructured process of autoethnography and the more structured diary study — allowed the first author to reflect on the differences between researchers or experts, and everyday users. Having a physical set of structured diary prompts allowed for a period of “thinking as writing”, enabling reflection upon how having expert knowledge may or may not translate into useful knowledge when dealing with everyday life. This is particularly beneficial in the context of home cyber security use, where first-person narratives have not made up part of the research corpus to date, despite a consistent recognition that users struggle to apply strong cyber security methods in personal contexts. The framing of the autoethnographic diary study contributes a very simple, but extremely powerful, tool for anyone with more knowledge than the average user of any technology, enabling the expert to reflect upon how they themselves have fared when using, understanding and discussing the technology in daily life.

What makes web data tables accessible? Insights and a tool for rendering accessible tables for people with visual impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517469,5,https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yeaseulkim/assets/papers/2022_make_table_accessible.pdf,"
The data table is a basic but versatile representation to communicate data. From government reports to bank statements, tables effectively carry essential data-driven information by visually organizing data using rows, columns, and other arrangements (e.g., merged cells). However, many tables online neglect the accessibility requirements for people who rely on screen readers, such as people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). First, we consolidated guidelines to understand what makes a table inaccessible for BLV people. We conducted an interview study to understand the importance of tables and identify further design requirements for an accessible table. We built a tool that automatically detects HTML formatted tables online and transforms them into accessible tables. Our evaluative study demonstrates how our tool can help participants understand the table’s structure and layout and support smooth navigation when the table is large and complex.

Smooth as steel wool: Effects of visual stimuli on the haptic perception of roughness in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517454,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrii-Matviienko/publication/360263412_Smooth_as_Steel_Wool_Effects_of_Visual_Stimuli_on_the_Haptic_Perception_of_Roughness_in_Virtual_Reality/links/6273e1ed3a23744a72661584/Smooth-as-Steel-Wool-Effects-of-Visual-Stimuli-on-the-Haptic-Perception-of-Roughness-in-Virtual-Reality.pdf,"
 Haptic Feedback is essential for lifelike Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. To provide a wide range of matching sensations of being touched or stroked, current approaches typically need large numbers of different physical textures. However, even advanced devices can only accommodate a limited number of textures to remain wearable. Therefore, a better understanding is necessary of how expectations elicited by different visualizations affect haptic perception, to achieve a balance between physical constraints and great variety of matching physical textures.  In this work, we conducted an experiment (N=31) assessing how the perception of roughness is affected within VR. We designed a prototype for arm stroking and compared the effects of different visualizations on the perception of physical textures with distinct roughnesses. Additionally, we used the visualizations’ real-world materials, no-haptics and vibrotactile feedback as baselines. As one result, we found that two levels of roughness can be sufficient to convey a realistic illusion.

How-to videos are often shot using camera angles that may not be optimal for learning motor tasks, with a prevalent use of third-person perspective. We present immersivePOV, an approach to film how-to videos from an immersive first-person perspective using a head-mounted 360° action camera. immersivePOV how-to videos can be viewed in a Virtual Reality headset, giving the viewer an eye-level viewpoint with three Degrees of Freedom. We evaluated our approach with two everyday motor tasks against a baseline first-person perspective and a third-person perspective. In a between-subjects study, participants were assigned to watch the task videos and then replicate the tasks. Results suggest that immersivePOV reduced perceived cognitive load and facilitated task learning. We discuss how immersivePOV can also streamline the video production process for content creators. Altogether, we conclude that immersivePOV is an effective approach to film how-to videos for learners and content creators alike.

Debiased-CAM to mitigate image perturbations with faithful visual explanations of machine learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517522,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517522,"
 Model explanations such as saliency maps can improve user trust in AI by highlighting important features for a prediction. However, these become distorted and misleading when explaining predictions of images that are subject to systematic error (bias) by perturbations and corruptions. Furthermore, the distortions persist despite model fine-tuning on images biased by different factors (blur, color temperature, day/night). We present Debiased-CAM to recover explanation faithfulness across various bias types and levels by training a multi-input, multi-task model with auxiliary tasks for explanation and bias level predictions. In simulation studies, the approach not only enhanced prediction accuracy, but also generated highly faithful explanations about these predictions as if the images were unbiased. In user studies, debiased explanations improved user task performance, perceived truthfulness and perceived helpfulness. Debiased training can provide a versatile platform for robust performance and explanation faithfulness for a wide range of applications with data biases.

Designing Flexible Longitudinal Regimens: Supporting Clinician Planning for Discontinuation of Psychiatric Drugs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502206,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502206,"
 Clinical decision support tools have typically focused on one-time support for diagnosis or prognosis, but have the ability to support providers in longitudinal planning of patient care regimens amidst infrastructural challenges. We explore an opportunity for technology support for discontinuing antidepressants, where clinical guidelines increasingly recommend gradual discontinuation over abruptly stopping to avoid withdrawal symptoms, but providers have varying levels of experience and diverse strategies for supporting patients through discontinuation. We conducted two studies with 12 providers, identifying providers’ needs in developing discontinuation plans and deriving design guidelines. We then iteratively designed and implemented AT Planner, instantiating the guidelines by projecting taper schedules and providing flexibility for adjustment. Provider feedback on AT Planner highlighted that discontinuation plans required balancing interpersonal and infrastructural constraints and surfaced the need for different technological support based on clinical experience. We discuss the benefits and challenges of incorporating flexibility and advice into clinical planning tools.

 Virtual reality allows us to operate bodies that differ substantially from our own. However, avatars with different topologies than the human form require control schemes and interfaces that effectively translate between user and avatar. In this position paper, we discuss the concept of ”non-anthropomorphic designs” that are inhuman in not just appearance, but in topology and/or motion. We examine current implementations of real and virtual non-anthropomorphic hands (NAHs), finding that existing NAHs generally rely on one-to-one or reductionist control strategies that limit their possible forms. We discuss the structure of a functional NAH system and design considerations for each component, including metrics for evaluating NAH system performance. The terminology and design considerations presented here support future research on NAHs in virtual and physical reality, as well as virtual and physical tool design, the body schema, and novel control interfaces and mappings.

 Augmented Reality (AR) applications embedding user-generated social media content into the physical environment have the potential to increase users’ socio-spatial connectedness but are under-researched. Therefore, we built a location-based AR social network app, including geotagged AR social media photos. We explore our app in a research probe of senior university students (n = 6), providing activity-related information to first-year university students at the campus (n = 11). We could identify how AR content is created at a location, what type of pictures are shared with whom, how the sharing increased the attachment to local places and the socio-spatial connectedness for first-year students. Finally, we discuss other application scenarios and outline challenges and opportunities for location-based AR social media networks.

 Esports play can cultivate real world skills. However, the path to mastery is not easy, and difficulty progressing can result in discontinuation. In the absence of a human coach, computational tools may provide much-needed guidance. However, the specific improvement activities that players engage in and the exact challenges they face are not well defined in the context of computational support. As such, most tools can only support players based on a high level understanding of their practices. We present the results of an interview study (n=17) that identified four improvement activities: practicing, leveraging the knowledge of others, tracking performance, and reflecting on gameplay and setting goals for the future, and four challenges: coordinating and collaborating with teammates, knowing what to do next, tracking game state, and tracking skill and improvement. We discuss six implications for future design and development based on these results.

The Challenge of (Non-) Disclosure: Exploring the Lived Experience of Ethiopian Adolescents with HIV and Their Attitudes Toward Technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502132,3,,"
Adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa are at the epicenter of the global HIV epidemic. Yet, technology to support HIV management overwhelmingly focuses on adult medication adherence, neglecting the complex lives of adolescents in low-income regions. We present findings from interviews and focus groups that included twelve HIV-positive adolescents in Ethiopia, and eleven adults from their care circles. We leverage the Integrated Behavioral Model to examine the lived experience of HIV and the space for technology. Additionally, we present an inductive thematic analysis, which highlights non-disclosure as a central theme, i.e., adolescents remaining unaware of their HIV status. Drawing from these findings, we discuss how to account for (the lack of) disclosure in the design of technology to support HIV management, and reflect on whether technology could (and should) support the process. We further highlight the risks that researchers and designers need to be aware of when designing HIV management technology for this audience.

In today’s society, where “one size fits all” does not work anymore, people’s requirements for material living became more personalized. Despite the fact that there exist customized services for a variety of commodities, these services are generally expensive and such customization for physical artifacts is not accessible by average users. In this work, we follow the promise of Programmable Filament [21], a novel technique to enable end-users with low-cost Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers to equip multi-material printing capabilities at low investment. We discovered that this technique can be applied to mix mechanical properties of two different materials (e.g., tensility) that may affect user’s comfort in 3D printed objects (e.g., personal optimal softness in sports gear) to meet individual needs.  We briefly introduce the process to 3D print programmable filaments using consumer-grade 3D printers in various composition ratios and fabricate 3D printed objects using an FDM printer blending multi-materials in the hot end, present a tensile testing experiment on sample objects made of such filaments to show its feasibility in producing new properties, and demonstrate two real-world applications that can be benefited from Programmable Filament utilization. We conclude with the remaining limitations and discussions about two potential structural improvements to improve printability of this filament for deployment.

Slide-tone and tilt-tone: 1-DOF haptic techniques for conveying shape characteristics of graphs to blind users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517790,3,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10379156,"
 We increasingly rely on up-to-date, data-driven graphs to understand our environments and make informed decisions. However, many of the methods blind and visually impaired users (BVI) rely on to access data-driven information do not convey important shape-characteristics of graphs, are not refreshable, or are prohibitively expensive. To address these limitations, we introduce two refreshable, 1-DOF audio-haptic interfaces based on haptic cues fundamental to object shape perception. Slide-tone uses finger position with sonification, and Tilt-tone uses fingerpad contact inclination with sonification to provide shape feedback to users. Through formative design workshops (n = 3) and controlled evaluations (n = 8), we found that BVI participants appreciated the additional shape information, versatility, and reinforced understanding these interfaces provide; and that task accuracy was comparable to using interactive tactile graphics or sonification alone. Our research offers insight into the benefits, limitations, and considerations for adopting these haptic cues into a data visualization context.

 The rise of consumer augmented reality (AR) technology has opened up new possibilities for interventions intended to disrupt and subvert cultural conventions. From defacing corporate logos to erecting geofenced digital monuments, more and more people are creating AR experiences for social causes. We sought to understand this new form of activism, including why people use AR for these purposes, opportunities and challenges in using it, and how well it can support activist goals. We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty people involved in projects that used AR for a social cause across six different countries. We found that AR can overcome physical world limitations of activism to convey immersive, multilayered narratives that aim to reveal invisible histories and perspectives. At the same time, people experienced challenges in creating, maintaining, and distributing their AR experiences to audiences. We discuss open questions and opportunities for creating AR tools and experiences for social change.

 Young children love to draw. However, at around age 10, they begin to feel that their drawings are unrealistic and give up drawing altogether. This study aims to help those who did not receive the proper training in drawing at the time and as a result remain at that level of drawing. First, through 12 drawing workshop sessions, we condensed 2 prominent art education books into 10 core drawing skills. Second, we designed and implemented a novel interactive system that helps the user repeatedly train these skills in the 5 stages of drawing a nice car in an accurate perspective. Our novel interactive technique, Tick'n'Draw, inspired by the drawing habits of experts, provides friendly guidance so that the user does not get lost in the many steps of perceptual and perspective drawing. Third, through a pilot test, we found that our system is quick to learn, easy to use, and can potentially improve real-world drawing abilities with continued use.

However, such eyelid gestures were designed by researchers. It remains unknown what eyelid gestures people with UMI would want and be able to perform. Moreover, other above-the-neck body parts (e.g., mouth, head) could be used to form more gestures. We conducted a user study in which 17 people with UMI designed above-the-neck gestures for 26 common commands on smartphones. We collected a total of 442 user-defined gestures involving the eyes, the mouth, and the head. Participants were more likely to make gestures with their eyes and preferred gestures that were simple, easy-to-remember, and less likely to draw attention from others. We further conducted a survey (N=24) to validate the usability and acceptance of these user-defined gestures. Results show that user-defined gestures were acceptable to both people with and without motor impairments.

Do People Use Games to Compensate for Psychological Needs During Crises? A Mixed-Methods Study of Gaming During COVID-19 Lockdowns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501858,3,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/185069/1/chi22_41_accessible.pdf,"
 Do people use games to cope with adverse life events and crises? Research informed by self-determination theory proposes that people might compensate for thwarted basic psychological needs in daily life by seeking out games that satisfy those lacking needs. To test this, we conducted a preregistered mixed-method survey study (n = 285) on people’s gaming behaviours and need states during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). We found qualitative evidence that gaming was an often actively sought out and successful means of replenishing particular needs, but one that could ‘backfire’ for some through an appraisal process discounting gaming as ‘unreal’. Meanwhile, contrary to our predictions, the quantitative data showed a “rich get richer, poor get poorer” pattern: need satisfaction in daily life positively correlated with need satisfaction in games. We derive methodological considerations and propose three potential explanations for this contradictory data pattern to pursue in future research.

Effects of speaking rate on speech and silent speech recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519611,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519611,"
 Speaking rate or the speed at which a person speaks is a fundamental user characteristic. This work investigates the rate in which users speak when interacting with speech and silent speech-based methods. Results revealed that native users speak about 8% faster than non-native users, but both groups slow down at comparable rates (34–40%) when interacting with these methods, mostly to increase their accuracy rates. A follow-up experiment confirms that slowing down does improve the accuracy of these methods. Both methods yield the best accuracy rates when speaking at 0.75x of the actual speaking rate. A post-hoc error analysis revealed that speech and silent speech methods and native and non-native speakers are susceptible to different types of errors.

 Is recommendation the new search? Recommender systems have shortened the search for information in everyday activities such as following the news, media, and shopping. In this paper, we address the challenges of capturing the situational needs of the user and linking them to the available datasets with the concept of Mindsets. Mindsets are categories such as “I’m hungry” and “Surprise me” designed to lead the users to explicitly state their intent, control the recommended content, save time, get inspired, and gain shortcuts for a satisficing exploration of POI recommendations. In our methodology, we first compiled Mindsets with a card sorting workshop and a formative evaluation. Using the insights gathered from potential end users, we then quantified Mindsets by linking them to POI utility measures using approximated lexicographic multi-objective optimisation. Finally, we ran a summative evaluation of Mindsets and derived guidelines for designing novel categories for recommender systems.

On Appropriation and Nostalgic Reminiscence of Technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519676,1,https://alarithuhde.com/publications/Appropriation-and-Nostalgic-Reminiscence-of-Technology.pdf,"
Technological objects present themselves as necessary, only to become obsolete faster than ever before. This phenomenon has led to a population that experiences a plethora of technological objects and interfaces as they age, which become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, “outdated technologies.” In other words, we assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.

” Pop-Up Alerts are the Bane of My Existence”: Designing Alerts for Cognitive Aids Used in Time-Critical Medical Settings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519669,2,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10379021,"
 Decision support alerts have the potential to assist clinicians in determining appropriate interventions for critically injured patients. The design of these alerts is critical because it can impact their adoption and effectiveness. In this late-breaking work, we explore how decision support alerts should be designed for cognitive aids used in time- and safety-critical medical events. We conducted interviews with 11 trauma team leaders to elicit their thoughts and reactions to potential alert designs. From the findings, we contribute three implications for designing alerts for cognitive aids that support team-based, time-critical decision making and discuss how these implications can be further explored in future work.

Designing for Relational Maintenance: New Directions for AAC Research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502011,3,https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60d251v,"
 AAC research has traditionally focused on input speed, leaving higher-level communication goals such as relational maintenance under-explored. Through semi-structured interviews with AAC users with motor and speech impairments and their primary family caregivers, we offer a nuanced understanding of AAC’s roles in maintaining close relationships. Our inductive analysis reveals emerging themes including how AAC users and their partners share the physical and mental workload to overcome communication barriers in complex situations. Our deductive application of the Relational Maintenance Strategies framework exposes the efforts made and the challenges encountered in managing social engagements, providing mutual support, and decoding implicit expressions. From these insights, we propose novel research directions for better supporting maintenance strategies and social purposes of communication, including notably mediating relational tensions, leveraging empowerment and identity, and supporting interactions for social closeness and etiquette, which we hope will motivate discussion in HCI communities on expanding AAC research space.

Designing Augmented Reality Based Interventions to Encourage Physical Activity During Virtual Classes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519749,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roshan-Peiris-2/publication/359514790_Designing_Augmented_Reality_Based_Interventions_to_Encourage_Physical_Activity_During_Virtual_Classes/links/624232387931cc7ccf019994/Designing-Augmented-Reality-Based-Interventions-to-Encourage-Physical-Activity-During-Virtual-Classes.pdf,"
 This paper presents an exploratory study of designing augmented reality (AR) based interventions to encourage physical activity among students attending virtual classes. We conducted a focus group study with four HCI students to understand the current behaviour of students during breaks between classes. Based on these insights we designed two AR interventions: AR Exergame, an interactive game that requires the user to move their hands to grab virtual apples; AR micro-movements, a method that requires the user to switch to a different physical space when starting a new virtual class. These AR interventions were aimed at encouraging students to perform micro-activities in between virtual classes, i.e. small non-strenuous activities. The effectiveness of these methods to reduce video conferencing fatigue, a.k.a Zoom fatigue, and also to compare it with the students current methods was tested through a user study with six participants.

Style Blink: exploring digital inking of structured information via handcrafted styling as a first-class object,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501988,3,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10151148/1/Marquardt_Style%20Blink.%20Exploring%20Digital%20Inking%20of%20Structured%20Information%20via%20Handcrafted%20Styling%20as%20a%20First-Class%20Object_AAM.pdf,"
 Structured note-taking forms such as sketchnoting, self-tracking journals, and bullet journaling go beyond immediate capture of information scraps. Instead, hand-drawn pride-in-craftmanship increases perceived value for sharing and display. But hand-crafting lists, tables, and calendars is tedious and repetitive. To support these practices digitally, Style Blink (“Style-Blocks+Ink”) explores handcrafted styling as a first-class object. Style-blocks encapsulate digital ink, enabling people to craft, modify, and reuse embellishments and decorations for larger structures, and apply custom layouts. For example, we provide interaction instruments that style ink for personal expression, inking palettes that afford creative experimentation, fillable pens that can be “loaded” with commands and actions to replace menu selections, techniques to customize inked structures post-creation by modifying the underlying handcrafted style-blocks and to re-layout the overall structure to match users’ preferred template. In effect, any ink stroke, notation, or sketch can be encapsulated as a style-object and re-purposed as a tool. Feedback from 13 users show the potential of style adaptation and re-use in individual sketching practices.

Exploring Emotion Responses toward Pedestrian Crossing Actions for Designing In-vehicle Empathic Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519764,2,https://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/134469600/3491101.3519764.pdf,"
While affective non-verbal communication between pedestrians and drivers has been shown to improve on-road safety and driving experiences, it remains a challenge to design driver assistance systems that can automatically capture these affective cues. In this early work, we identify users’ emotional self-report responses towards commonly occurring pedestrian actions while crossing a road. We conducted a crowd-sourced web-based survey (N=91), where respondents with prior driving experience viewed videos of 25 pedestrian interaction scenarios selected from the JAAD (Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving) dataset, and thereafter provided valence and arousal self-reports. We found participants’ emotion self-reports (especially valence) are strongly influenced by actions including hand waving, nodding, impolite hand gestures, and inattentive pedestrian(s) crossing while engaged with a phone. Our findings provide a first step towards designing in-vehicle empathic interfaces that can assist in driver emotion regulation during on-road interactions, where the identified pedestrian actions serve as future driver emotion induction stimuli.

Supporting serendipitous discovery and balanced analysis of online product reviews with interaction-driven metrics and bias-mitigating suggestions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517649,3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06221,"
 In this study, we investigate how supporting serendipitous discovery and analysis of online product reviews can encourage readers to explore reviews more comprehensively prior to making purchase decisions. We propose two interventions — Exploration Metrics that can help readers understand and track their exploration patterns through visual indicators and a Bias Mitigation Model that intends to maximize knowledge discovery by suggesting sentiment and semantically diverse reviews. We designed, developed, and evaluated a text analytics system called Serendyze, where we integrated these interventions. We asked 100 crowd workers to use Serendyze to make purchase decisions based on product reviews. Our evaluation suggests that exploration metrics enabled readers to efficiently cover more reviews in a balanced way, and suggestions from the bias mitigation model influenced readers to make confident data-driven decisions. We discuss the role of user agency and trust in text-level analysis systems and their applicability in domains beyond review exploration.

 In the last ten years, there have been great efforts to increase automation in the health-social care ecosystem, including the use of robotics to provide practical and social care. However, development of these robots often does not include potential users until late in the design process, so they may not adequately address user expectations or needs. This pilot introduces LEGO Serious Play workshops as design tools to support individuals’ articulation of the potential benefits and consequences of robot care systems. The narratives elicited address key themes in robotics for care, indicating the workshops’ potential use early in design.

 Artists and designers have been exploring how robotics can be used to interact with our environment in new ways. Robots connect computational design processes with the physical environment, making digital interaction with nature possible. We present a robotic process for planting that enables the computational design of landscapes. We demonstrate how robotic planting can be used for generative art and design by creating a living typeface grown from seed. The robot draws a message by 3-dimensionally (3D) printing a blend of planting media and seeds. When the seeds germinate, the glyphs emerge from their substrate in a flush of green. The letterforms become dynamic living organisms. Artistic agency shifts from the artist to nature.

Supporting Anaesthetists during 'Red Blanket'Trauma Surgery: An Analysis of Work Practices and Requirements for a Head-Worn Display Support System,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519745,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/nivx2k6jxbgsbc3lhzibfmnm3q/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519745,"
‘Red blanket’ (RB) processes accelerate the surgical treatment of patients who have suffered severe trauma. Although the rapid start of surgery has positive effects on patient outcomes, the short time available to prepare for a case and the limited information available at the outset of care can be challenging for physicians. To support the lead of an RB team in making the right clinical decisions quickly, this work proposes a head-worn display (HWD) based information system. HWD could be valuable in RB settings, because they provide information in a continuous and hands-free manner, potentially allowing physicians to access case relevant data while treating the patient. Through an interview study with seven anaesthetists, we studied work practices of RB team leads and identified user requirements for the HWD based support system. We discuss opportunities and challenges for HWDs in RB settings and provide a detailed description of the developed HWD application.

 Scientists collaborate remotely across institutions, countries and continents. However, collaborating remotely is challenging. Video-conferencing tools used for meetings limit the cognitive practices that collaborators can partake in. In virtual reality (VR) users can gain back some of the spatial and social affordances present in collocated collaboration, as well as benefit from interactions that would not be possible in the real world. We introduce Embodied Notes: a cognitive support tool designed to be used in a collaborative virtual environment.

The impact of latency on navigation in a first-person perspective game,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517660,4,https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/papers/nav-chi-22/paper-draft.pdf,"
 Competitive first-person shooter games are played over a network, where latency can degrade player performance. To better understand latency’s impact, a promising approach is to study how latency affects individual game actions, such as moving and shooting. While target selection (aiming and shooting at an opponent) is fairly well studied, navigation (moving an avatar into position) is not. This paper presents results from a 30-person user study that evaluates the impact of latency on first-person navigation using a custom “hide and seek” game that isolates avatar movement in a manner intended to be similar to movement in a first-person shooter game. Analysis of the results shows latency has pronounced effects on player performance (score and seek positioning), with subjective opinions on Quality of Experience following suit.

 The recent advances in smart city infrastructure have provided support for a higher adoption of surveillance cameras as a mainstream crime prevention measure. However, a consequent massive deployment raises concerns about privacy issues among citizens. In this paper, we present VR-Surv, a VR-based privacy aware surveillance system for large scale urban environments. Our concept is based on conveying the semantics of the scene uniquely, without revealing the identity of the individuals or the contextual details that might violate the privacy of the entities present in the surveillance area. For this, we create a virtual replica of the areas of interest, in real-time, through the combination of procedurally generated environments and markerless motion capture models. The results of our preliminary evaluation revealed that our system successfully conceals privacy-sensitive data, while preserving the semantics of the scene. Furthermore, participants in our user study expressed higher acceptance to being surveilled through the proposed system.

We play and learn rhythmically: gesture-based rhythm game for children with intellectual developmental disabilities to learn manual sign,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517456,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/vpa46uognnfvlbdiulglnytiqi/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517456,"
 Manual sign systems have been introduced to improve the communication of children with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD). Due to the lack of learning support tools, teachers face many practical challenges in teaching manual sign to children, such as low attention span and the need for persistent intervention. To address these issues, we collaborated with teachers to develop the Sondam Rhythm Game, a gesture-based rhythm game that assists in teaching manual sign language, and ran a four-week empirical study with five teachers and eight children with IDD. Based on video annotation and post-hoc interviews, our game-based learning approach has the potential to be effective at teaching manual sign to children with IDD. Our approach improved children attention span and motivation while also increasing the number of voluntary gestures made without the need for prompting. Other practical issues and learning challenges were also uncovered to improve teaching paradigms for children with IDD.

 Animated GIF images have become prevalent in internet culture, often used to express richer and more nuanced meanings than static images. But animated GIFs often lack adequate alternative text descriptions, and it is challenging to generate such descriptions automatically, resulting in inaccessible GIFs for blind or low-vision (BLV) users. To improve the accessibility of animated GIFs for BLV users, we provide a system called Ga11y (pronounced “galley”), for creating GIF annotations. Ga11y combines the power of machine intelligence and crowdsourcing and has three components: an Android client for submitting annotation requests, a backend server and database, and a web interface where volunteers can respond to annotation requests. We evaluated three human annotation interfaces and employ the one that yielded the best annotation quality. We also conducted a multi-stage evaluation with 12 BLV participants from the United States and China, receiving positive feedback.

Scaling Creative Inspiration with Fine-Grained Functional Aspects of Ideas,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517434,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517434,"
Large repositories of products, patents and scientific papers offer an opportunity for building systems that scour millions of ideas and help users discover inspirations. However, idea descriptions are typically in the form of unstructured text, lacking key structure that is required for supporting creative innovation interactions. Prior work has explored idea representations that were either limited in expressivity, required significant manual effort from users, or dependent on curated knowledge bases with poor coverage. We explore a novel representation that automatically breaks up products into fine-grained functional aspects capturing the purposes and mechanisms of ideas, and use it to support important creative innovation interactions: functional search for ideas, and exploration of the design space around a focal problem by viewing related problem perspectives pooled from across many products. In user studies, our approach boosts the quality of creative search and inspirations, substantially outperforming strong baselines by 50-60%.

 Designers and HCI researchers from industry and academia have been exploring the opportunities that emerge from incorporating behavioral data into the design process. For this, designers employ and combine data from multiple sources, multiple scales, and types to obtain valuable insights that inform and support design decisions. This combination unfolds through interdisciplinary collaborations, enabled by various methods and approaches, including participatory data analysis, sense-making interviews, co-design workshops, and data storytelling. However, due to the personal nature of behavioral data and the open-ended, iterative approach of Human-Centered Design, data-centric design activities clash with current HCI and data science practices. As both industry and academia increasingly use data-centric design processes, we recognize a need to share both examples and experiences to reinforce that most practices (and failed experiences) do not yet emerge solely from the literature. In this Special Interest Group, we aim to provide a space for design, data, and HCI researchers and practitioners to connect, reflect on the current practices, and explore potential approaches to further integrating behavioral data into design activities.

A healthy dialogue between civil society and governments stems from meaningful communication and understanding of political data. Visualization tools have the potential to support this. To contribute to a growing Digital Civics agenda in the Global South, we built an interactive visualization prototype that enables open-ended analysis of legislative roll-call vote data from the Ecuadorian parliament; political actors were interviewed and shown this tool to explore future opportunities for open parliament technologies. This work serves as motivation for the design of open parliament technologies which ought to (i) provide stories and narratives about the parliament’s and legislators’ political history, (ii) support the understanding of how parliamentary bills and resolutions become law, and (iii) grapple with the socio-technical considerations that platforms must undergo in order to make citizen participation an incremental journey rather than a fixed destination.

A New Uncanny Valley? The Effects of Speech Fidelity and Human Listener Gender on Social Perceptions of a Virtual-Human Speaker,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517564,3,https://3dvar.com/Do2022A.pdf,"
 Virtual humans can be used to deliver persuasive arguments; yet, those with synthetic text-to-speech (TTS) have been perceived less favorably than those with recorded human speech. In this paper, we investigate standard concatenative TTS and more advanced neural TTS. We conducted a 3x2 between-subjects experiment (n=79) to evaluate the effect of a virtual human’s speech fidelity at three levels (Standard TTS, Neural TTS, and Human speech) and the listener’s gender (male or female) on perceptions and persuasion. We found that the virtual human was perceived as significantly less trustworthy by both genders, if they used neural TTS compared to human speech, while male listeners (but not females) also perceived standard TTS as less trustworthy than human speech. Our findings indicate that neural TTS may not be an effective choice for persuasive virtual humans and that gender of the listener plays a role in how virtual humans are perceived.

Reducing the cognitive load of playing a digital tabletop game with a multimodal interface,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502062,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502062,"
 Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) combining speech and spatial input have the potential to elicit minimal cognitive load. Low cognitive load increases effectiveness as well as user satisfaction and is regarded as an important aspect of intuitive use. While this potential has been extensively theorized in the research community, experiments that provide supporting observations based on functional interfaces are still scarce. In particular, there is a lack of studies comparing the commonly used Unimodal Interfaces (UMIs) with theoretically superior synergistic MMI alternatives. Yet, these studies are an essential prerequisite for generalizing results, developing practice-oriented guidelines, and ultimately exploiting the potential of MMIs in a broader range of applications. This work contributes a novel observation towards the resolution of this shortcoming in the context of the following combination of applied interaction techniques, tasks, application domain, and technology: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a synergistic speech & touch MMI and a touch-only menu-based UMI (interaction techniques) for selection and system control tasks in a digital tabletop game (application domain) on an interactive surface (technology). Cognitive load, user experience, and intuitive use are evaluated, with the former being assessed by means of the dual-task paradigm. Our experiment shows that the implemented MMI causes significantly less cognitive load and is perceived significantly more usable and intuitive than the UMI. Based on our results, we derive recommendations for the interface design of digital tabletop games on interactive surfaces. Further, we argue that our results and design recommendations are suitable to be generalized to other application domains on interactive surfaces for selection and system control tasks.

Detecting challenge from physiological signals: A primary study with a typical game scenario,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519806,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/im37z7wt5feolnrhlrnzoe4xfe/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519806,"
 Challenge is the core element of digital games. Game challenge with an appropriate type and level that matches with players’ skill, experience and motivation would lead players to achieve the optimal player experience. With a wider spectrum of challenge types such as physical, cognitive, and emotional challenge provided by modern digital games, a questionnaire tool of CORGIS has recently been developed to evaluate the whole range of challenge experiences subjectively. However, such challenge experiences still lack measures to evaluate them objectively ”in real time”. To explore the possibility to detect different challenge types based on physiological signals, we conducted an experiment where 12 players’ physiological signals (EDA, ECG, EMG, RSP and TEM) of overcoming different types of game challenges were recorded. With 80 extracted physiological features, two methods (ANOVA-based and Regression-based) were adopted to select challenge-related physiological features. Results of logistic regression models showed that both methods obtained detection accuracy over 60%, which suggest potential for further development of a real-time challenge measurement instrument.

Leveraging the human propensity for embodied interaction, SocialStools is a socio-spatial interface that facilitates playful social interactions across strangers in a physical space, fostering togetherness. Three stools on caster wheels generate sound and image around them in response to sitting on them, and moving and rotating relative to each other. In this paper, we identify the challenges of stranger interactions, introduce our cyber-physical system, and describe and demonstrate three interaction situations: sitting, moving closer and away from each other, and rotating to face or turn away from each other. By translating these interactions into visual and auditory effects, we explore the possibilities of merging the socio-physical world with a digital system to create unique social affordances for interpersonal interactions that foster togetherness. Our demonstration transforms three strangers into a trio of sound-and-image makers interacting through creative, embodied play.

 We present Shape-Haptics, an approach for designers to rapidly design and fabricate passive force feedback mechanisms for physical interfaces. Such mechanisms are used in everyday interfaces and tools, and they are challenging to design. Shape-Haptics abstracts and broadens the haptic expression of this class of force feedback systems through 2D laser cut configurations that are simple to fabricate. They leverage the properties of polyoxymethylene plastic and comprise a compliant spring structure that engages with a sliding profile during tangible interaction. By shaping the sliding profile, designers can easily customize the haptic force feedback delivered by the mechanism. We provide a computational design sandbox to facilitate designers to explore and fabricate Shape-Haptics mechanisms. We also propose a series of applications that demonstrate the utility of Shape-Haptics in creating and customizing haptics for different physical interfaces.

End-User Creation and Control of Daily Automations in Intelligent Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503752,1,https://giove.isti.cnr.it/Users/Fabio/humanation.html,"
The combination of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence has made it possible to introduce numerous automations in our daily environments. Many new interesting possibilities and opportunities have been enabled, but there are also risks and problems. Often these problems are originated from approaches that have not been able to consider the users’ viewpoint sufficiently. We need to empower people in order to actually understand the automations in their surroundings environments, modify them, and create new ones, even if they have no programming knowledge. The course discusses these problems and some possible solutions to provide people with the possibility to control and create their daily automations.

Categorizing open government data users by exploring their challenges and proficiency,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519689,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fanghui-Xiao/publication/360260791_Categorizing_Open_Government_Data_Users_by_Exploring_their_Challenges_and_Proficiency/links/626bf7b6b277c02187d51f9c/Categorizing-Open-Government-Data-Users-by-Exploring-their-Challenges-and-Proficiency.pdf,"
 Developing user personas has been a crucial aspect of human-centered system design for decades as it helps in understanding and segregating users based on their prominent characteristics. However, such a technique has not been applied in developing and improving systems for supporting open government data (OGD) users. Therefore, this paper explores OGD users’ characteristics and creates relevant personas for them. Open coding-based content analysis and k-means clustering were performed on posts of an online community managed by a U.S. local-level OGD portal, where users’ characteristics such as purposes, challenges, and proficiency in civic data domain knowledge and computational skills were used as features for clustering. Through manually analyzing the output clusters, we identified three personas with their distinct behavior patterns based on their proficiency. The proposed personas can facilitate in personalizing informational and technological support for OGD forum users.

“It Basically Started Using Me:” An Observational Study of Password Manager Usage,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517534,4,https://userlab.utk.edu/files/papers/ruoti/2022/oesch2022observational.pdf,"
There is limited information regarding how users employ password managers in the wild and why they use them in that manner. To address this knowledge gap, we conduct observational interviews with 32 password manager users. Using grounded theory, we identify four theories describing the processes and rationale behind participants’ usage of password managers. We find that many users simultaneously use both a browser-based and a third-party manager, using each as a backup for the other, with this new paradigm having intriguing usability and security implications. Users also eschew generated passwords because these passwords are challenging to enter and remember when the manager is unavailable, necessitating new generators that create easy-to-enter and remember passwords. Additionally, the credential audits provided by most managers overwhelm users, limiting their utility and indicating a need for more proactive and streamlined notification systems. We also discuss mobile usage, adoption and promotion, and other related topics.

Remote communication via huggable interfaces-behavior synchronization and social presence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519699,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/3lkzm6kuzrgg5au6sb4w53f4yi/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519699,"
 Interfaces for mediated communication are being designed to increase the quality of the interaction of people geographically separated. Communication modalities offered by the medium was found to affect on the perceived social presence, but also communication strategies involving higher coordinated actions could be related to a higher social presence. The purpose of this study was to investigate how behavior synchronization can influence individual’s perceived social presence and behavior coordination while interacting through a huggable interface with simple visual cues. Through an experimental study that involved two virtual agents, it was observed that a partner that promote synchronous actions : 1) led to a higher level of perceived social presence, and 2) encouraged more responsive behaviors from the user.

Two-Gimbal PAT: An artistic installation combining mechanical and acoustic rotation of levitated content,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519891,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/r5lrxh2yg5cmxgubkrw22m44ua/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519891,"
Interactive applications using ultrasonic phased arrays of transducers (PATs) provide novel opportunities to create 3D displays. They show visual content using levitated particles such as polystyrene beads, thread or fabric, that dynamically change to render volumetric shapes in mid-air. Typically, this technology uses fixed arrays of transducers (e.g., two boards vertically or horizontally aligned) to display interactive content. That is, a fixed system of reference (SoR), defined by the levitation device, and dynamic mid-air content. This demo proposes a novel setup, featuring a dynamic-SoR for the device with the dynamic mid-air content. We do this by combining a PAT-based levitation device mounted onto a two-gimbal mechanism, resulting into a device with a dynamic coordinate system for volumetric animations. We describe our setup and demonstration, which aims to create an intriguing experience, where both the content and the device itself can freely move in 3D space, with the aim of challenging the user's expectations about the content displayed or even the principles enabling it.

Rediscovering affordance: A reinforcement learning perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501992,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501992,"
Affordance refers to the perception of possible actions allowed by an object. Despite its relevance to human–computer interaction, no existing theory explains the mechanisms that underpin affordance-formation; that is, how affordances are discovered and adapted via interaction. We propose an integrative theory of affordance-formation based on the theory of reinforcement learning in cognitive sciences. The key assumption is that users learn to associate promising motor actions to percepts via experience when reinforcement signals (success/failure) are present. They also learn to categorize actions (e.g., “rotating” a dial), giving them the ability to name and reason about affordance. Upon encountering novel widgets, their ability to generalize these actions determines their ability to perceive affordances. We implement this theory in a virtual robot model, which demonstrates human-like adaptation of affordance in interactive widgets tasks. While its predictions align with trends in human data, humans are able to adapt affordances faster, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms.

BoldMove: Enabling IoT Device Control on Ubiquitous Touch Interfaces by Semantic Mapping and Sequential Selection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519805,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/5x7oazs3yvcj7dkezor362rype/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519805,"
 Recent advances in ultra-low-power ubiquitous touch interfaces make touch inputs possible anytime, anywhere. However, their functions are usually pre-determined, i.e., one button is only associated with one fixed function. BoldMove enables spontaneous and efficient association of touch inputs and IoT device functions with semantic-based function filtering and a wait-confirm sequential selection strategy. In this way, such touch interfaces become ubiquitous IoT device controllers. We proposed the semantic-based IoT function filtering to improve control efficiency, then designed the sequential selection mechanism for interfaces with constrained input and output resources. We implemented BoldMove on a custom-built touch interface with capacitive button inputs and a smartwatch display. We then conducted a user study to determine the design parameters for the sequential selection method. At last, we validated that BoldMove only takes 3.25 seconds to complete a selection task if the target function appears within the Top-3 displayed item. Even if the assumption is relaxed to Top-10, BoldMove is still estimated to be more efficient than the conventional selection method with device-based filtering and menu-navigated selection.

"Because I'm Restricted, 2–4 PM Unable to See Messages: Exploring Users' Perceptions and Likely Practices around Exposing Attention Management Use on IM …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517616,5,https://scholar.archive.org/work/wbaivkhzbrgm7bn5tnumuyi4ay/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517616,"
 Attention-management tools can restrict online communication, but may cause collateral damage to their users’ fulfillment of communication expectations. This paper explores the idea of integrating attention management into instant messaging (IM), by 1) disclosing restriction status via an online status indicator (OSI) to manage contacts’ expectations, and 2) imposing communication limits to reduce communication distraction. We used a speed-dating design method to allow 43 participants to rapidly compare 48 types of OSI restriction in various conversational contexts. We identified two “tug-of-wars” that take place when attention management is integrated into IM apps: one between fulfilling one’s contacts’ expectations and protecting one’s own attention, and the other, between protecting one’s privacy and asserting the justifiability of using communication restrictions. We also highlighted the participants’ desire to be diplomatic for sustaining their positive images and maintaining relational connectedness. Finally, we provide design recommendations for integrating attention management into IM apps.

REVES: Redirection Enhancement Using Four-Pole Vestibular Electrode Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519626,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519626,"
 Redirected walking (RDW) visually manipulates the movement of the virtual environment (VE) such that the movement of the real environment (RE) and VE are no longer matched 1:1. With RDW, users can overcome the spatial constraints of RE, such as furniture, walls, and columns, and freely move the wider VE using natural gait motion. However, when the intensity of visual manipulations increases, people notice the RDW manipulation owing to visual-vestibular inconsistency, and experience discomfort like motion sickness. To address visual-vestibular inconsistency, we modulated vestibular information in various directions to match the modulation of visual information using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). We proposed a new RDW system—REVES: redirection enhancement using four-pole vestibular electrode stimulation. REVES stimulates the user’s vestibular system according to various visual modulation directions using four-pole GVS based on the proposed algorithm. REVES changed the detection threshold of RDW in three manipulation cases: rotation, translation, and walking direction.

Correlation between unconscious mouse actions and human cognitive workload,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519658,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08559,"
 Unconscious behaviors are one of the indicators of the human perception process from a psychological perspective. As a result of perception responses, hand gestures show behavioral responses from given stimuli. Mouse usages in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) show hand gestures that individuals perceive information processing. This paper presents an investigation of the correlation between unconscious mouse actions and human cognitive workload. We extracted mouse behaviors from a Robot Operating System (ROS) file-based dataset that user responses are reproducible. We analyzed redundant mouse movements to complete a dual n-back game by solely pressing the left and right buttons. Starting from a hypothesis that unconscious mouse behaviors predict different levels of cognitive loads, we statistically analyzed mouse movements. We also validated mouse behaviors with other modalities in the dataset, including self-questionnaire and eye blinking results. As a result, we found that mouse behaviors that occur unconsciously and human cognitive workload correlate.

Nudge for Reflective Mind: Understanding How Accessing Peer Concept Mapping and Commenting Affects Reflection of High-stakes Information,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519815,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519815,"
Deep conceptualization and reflection of online information is essential to people’s knowledge acquisition and decision-making in high-stakes domains, such as health. Reflective thinking, however, demands extra cognitive efforts, resources and skills, and therefore could deter people from taking further steps to question information encountered online. In this paper, we proposed a digital nudging tool for supporting critical reflection of video contents based on concept mapping and peer commenting mechanisms. The proposed tool, DeepThinkingMap, aims to promote people’s understanding and reflection of video content via interface features that foster the disclosure of personal conceptualization and transparency of personal beliefs about the video. By seeing how peers conceptualize and reflect about the video content, the concepts and comments made available to people could potentially serve as a ”thinking nudge,” allowing individuals to reap in-depth thoughts about the video otherwise inaccessible to them. Through a proof-of-concept controlled evaluation, we found that seeing peer thoughts through DeepThinkingMap significantly increased content comprehension, and fostered greater efforts for reflection in comparison to the baseline of receiving no nudge. The study contributes to understanding the socio-technical-cognitive mechanisms and the design space of social nudging that may be utilized to support reflection and critical thinking toward high-stakes information.

Two heads are better than one: A dimension space for unifying human and artificial intelligence in shared control,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517610,3,https://equis.cs.queensu.ca/~equis/pubs/2022/cimolino-chi-22.pdf,"
Shared control is an emerging interaction paradigm in which a human and an AI partner collaboratively control a system. Shared control unifies human and artificial intelligence, making the human’s interactions with computers more accessible, safe, precise, effective, creative, and playful. This form of interaction has independently emerged in contexts as varied as mobility assistance, driving, surgery, and digital games. These domains each have their own problems, terminology, and design philosophies. Without a common language for describing interactions in shared control, it is difficult for designers working in one domain to share their knowledge with designers working in another. To address this problem, we present a dimension space for shared control, based on a survey of 55 shared control systems from six different problem domains. This design space analysis tool enables designers to classify existing systems, make comparisons between them, identify higher-level design patterns, and imagine solutions to novel problems.

 Digital lutherie is a sub-domain of digital craft focused on creating digital musical instruments: high-performance devices for musical expression. It represents a nuanced and challenging area of human-computer interaction that is well established and mature, offering the opportunity to observe designers’ work on highly demanding human-computer interfaces. This paper explores how and why digital luthiers choose their tools and how these tools relate to the challenges they face. Findings from 27 standardised open-ended interviews with prominent digital luthiers from commercial, research, independent and artistic backgrounds are analysed through reflexive thematic analysis. Our discussion explores their perspectives, finding that a process of pragmatic rationalisation and environmental influences play a significant role in tool selection. We also present how challenges faced by digital luthiers relate to social creativity and meta-design. These findings build upon the existing literature that examines the designer-tool relationship.

 Technology has provided an environment for connecting indigenous community members and provide a means for them to seek and engage with their indigenous knowledge (IK). Emerging research has examined the effects of social media on specific IK, including the possibility of undermining community agency. In this work, we contrast how indigenous community members engage with IK offline, and in their own self-organized communities online. Through interviews with community members and a study of Facebook Pages and Facebook Groups, we seek to better understand these practices and elicit design recommendations. Our findings describe how community roles have shifted in the presence of technology, notably with absence of elders and the inclusion of “born towns”–community members who live in non-traditional settings. We also find that fluency in the indigenous language served both as a gatekeeper: guarding the community knowledge, while also facilitating discussion surrounding different aspects of IK.

In this paper, we used both LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling and qualitative analysis to analyse WFH related posts on Weibo (N=1093) and Twitter (N=907) during COVID-19. We highlighted unique differences of WFH challenges between two platforms, including long work time, family and food commitment and health concerns on Weibo; casual wearing habits on Twitter. We then provided possible guidelines from a cross-cultural perspective on how to improve the WFH experience based on these differences.

 Smartwatches and fitness trackers integrate different sensors from inertial measurement units to heart rate sensors in a very compact and affordable form factor. This makes them interesting and relevant research tools. One potential application domain is virtual reality, e.g., for health related applications such as exergames or simulation approaches. However, commercial devices complicate and limit the collection of raw and real-time data, suffer from privacy issues and are not tailored to using them with VR tracking systems. We address these issues with an open source design to facilitate the construction of VR-enabled wearables for conducting scientific experiments. Our work is motivated by research in mixed realities in pervasive computing environments. We introduce our system and present a proof-of-concept study with 17 participants. Our results show that the wearable reliably measures high-quality data comparable to commercially available fitness trackers and that it does not impede movements or interfere with VR tracking.

 Designing wearables is a complex task that includes many layers, such as wearability, interactivity, functionality, social and cultural considerations. For decades now, prototyping toolkits are proposed to aid diverse types of audiences in exploring the design of smart accessories and garments. However, the task of designing toolkits for wearables has not received a comprehensive discussion and systematic reflection. In this workshop, we look into challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned in using, developing and evaluating wearable toolkits by focusing on their target groups, purposes, effects on the final designs. By bringing together researchers and practitioners who are experienced with the design, use and assessment of wearable toolkits, we see a particular opportunity in providing a broader perspective on defining the future of wearable toolkit designs.

Design systems provide detailed guidelines on UI items’ appearance and behavior and serve as a primary reference for interface development. For bidirectional languages (e.g., Arabic and Hebrew), it is essential to highlight an additional parameter – the direction of the UI item. However, investigating the correct direction of all items could involve costly research. Hence, it is important to set priorities for such research. While prioritizing usability issues has long been attended by the HCI community, the specific problem of this research is new and has never been addressed. To deal with this challenge, we conducted five focus groups with HCI professionals and identified a set of prioritization criteria. We then used those criteria to prioritize the UI items for future empirical evaluation of their preferred directionality. In addition to these findings, we provide some insights from our experience of using focus groups for the prioritization task.

 Current commodity Virtual Reality (VR) hardware allows for free, even wireless roaming, however it is still confined by a finite tracking space. To overcome this issue, past research has introduced different methods for vertical locomotion, ranging from walking on a treadmill to interaction paradigms such as teleportation. Recently, researchers have integrated rock climbing on a physical wall into VR experiences. The space available is naturally confined by the dimensions of the wall. Building upon this, we present implementation details and future research directions of a VR system for vertical locomotion on a rock climbing treadmill.

The social embeddedness of peer production: A comparative qualitative analysis of three Indian language Wikipedia editions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501832,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501832,"
 Why do some peer production projects do a better job at engaging potential contributors than others? We address this question by comparing three Indian language Wikipedias, namely, Malayalam, Marathi, and Kannada. We found that although the three projects share goals, technological infrastructure, and a similar set of challenges, Malayalam Wikipedia’s community engages language speakers in contributing at a much higher rate than the others. Drawing from a grounded theory analysis of interviews with 18 community participants from the three projects, we found that experience with participatory governance and free/open-source software in the Malayalam community supported high engagement of contributors. Counterintuitively, we found that financial resources intended to increase participation in the Marathi and Kannada communities hindered the growth of these communities. Our findings underscore the importance of social and cultural context in the trajectories of peer production communities.

 From transoceanic bridges to large-scale installations, truss structures have been known for their structural stability and shape complexity. In addition to the advantages of static trusses, truss structures have a large degree of freedom to change shape when equipped with rotatable joints and retractable beams. However, it is difficult to design a complex motion and build a control system for large numbers of trusses. In this paper, we present PneuMesh, a novel truss-based shape-changing system that is easy to design and build but still able to achieve a range of tasks. PneuMesh accomplishes this by introducing an air channel connection strategy and reconfigurable constraint design that drastically decreases the number of control units without losing the complexity of shape-changing. We develop a design tool with real-time simulation to assist users in designing the shape and motion of truss-based shape-changing robots and devices. A design session with seven participants demonstrates that PneuMesh empowers users to design and build truss structures with a wide range of shapes and various functional motions.

Understanding emotion changes in mobile experience sampling,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501944,3,https://kimauk.github.io/file/paper/CHI22_ESM.pdf,"
Mobile experience sampling methods (ESMs) are widely used to measure users’ affective states by randomly sending self-report requests. However, this random probing can interrupt users and adversely influence users’ emotional states by inducing disturbance and stress. This work aims to understand how ESMs themselves may compromise the validity of ESM responses and what contextual factors contribute to changes in emotions when users respond to ESMs. Towards this goal, we analyze 2,227 samples of the mobile ESM data collected from 78 participants. Our results show ESM interruptions positively or negatively affected users’ emotional states in at least 38% of ESMs, and the changes in emotions are closely related to the contexts users were in prior to ESMs. Finally, we discuss the implications of using the ESM and possible considerations for mitigating the variability in emotional responses in the context of mobile data collection for affective computing.

Interpolating happiness: understanding the intensity gradations of face emojis across cultures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517661,3,,"
 We frequently utilize face emojis to express emotions in digital communication. But how wholly and precisely do such pictographs sample the emotional spectrum, and are there gaps to be closed? Our research establishes emoji intensity scales for seven basic emotions: happiness, anger, disgust, sadness, shock, annoyance, and love. In our survey (N = 1195), participants worldwide assigned emotions and intensities to 68 face emojis. According to our results, certain feelings, such as happiness or shock, are visualized by manifold emojis covering a broad spectrum of intensities. Other feelings, such as anger, have limited and only very intense representative visualizations. We further emphasize that the cultural background influences emojis’ perception: for instance, linear-active cultures (e.g., UK, Germany) rate the intensity of such visualizations higher than multi-active (e.g., Brazil, Russia) or reactive cultures (e.g., Indonesia, Singapore). To summarize, our manuscript promotes future research on more expressive, culture-aware emoji design.

FlexHaptics: A Design Method for Passive Haptic Inputs Using Planar Compliant Structures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502113,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502113,"
 This paper presents FlexHaptics, a design method for creating custom haptic input interfaces. Our approach leverages planar compliant structures whose force-deformation relationship can be altered by adjusting the geometries. Embedded with such structures, a FlexHaptics module exerts a fine-tunable haptic effect (i.e., resistance, detent, or bounce) along a movement path (i.e., linear, rotary, or ortho-planar). These modules can work separately or combine into an interface with complex movement paths and haptic effects. To enable the parametric design of FlexHaptic modules, we provide a design editor that converts user-specified haptic properties into underlying mechanical structures of haptic modules. We validate our approach and demonstrate the potential of FlexHaptic modules through six application examples, including a slider control for a painting application and a piano keyboard interface on touchscreens, a tactile low vision timer, VR game controllers, and a compound input device of a joystick and a two-step button.

Effect of Anthropomorphic Glyph Design on the Accuracy of Categorization Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519748,1,https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/43g6h/providers/osfstorage/624b911e129f1c05176a21d2?action=download&direct&version=1,"
 Data glyphs continue to gain popularity for information communication. However, the cognition and perception theory of glyphs is largely unknown for many tasks including “categorization”. Categorization tasks are common in everyday life from sorting objects to a doctor diagnosing a patient’s disease. However it is unknown how glyph designs, specifically anthropomorphic human-like representations which in prior visualization research have demonstrated improved information recall, affect accuracy in a categorization task. To better understand how people comprehend and perceive glyphs for categorization, including anthropomorphic representations, we conducted a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate whether more human-like glyphs would lead to higher categorization accuracy. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found evidence that subjects are more accurate with a less anthropomorphic glyph. A posthoc analysis also reveals that anthropomorphic glyphs introduce biases due to their anatomically salient features. Based on these results we propose design guidelines for glyphs used in categorization tasks. The supplemental material of this paper available is on https://osf.io/3bgcv/.

And unavoidably, part of maintaining relationships includes managing conflict and disagreements, from who does which chores to who’s a better political candidate. This SIG will bring together an interdisciplinary group of designers and researchers to discuss how to design, build, and evaluate systems to support constructive arguments online. We ask: How can online systems support conflict while sustaining and possibly strengthening interpersonal relationships? We will explore these questions in the context of a collaborative literature review across fields relevant to social computing and the psychology of conflict, paired with group discussion on how to design for disagreements.

 For a small group of office workers who share the same workspace and the task load, leveraging their social skills and awareness could further increase their mutual awareness of each other’s work-related stress. This paper presents a case study of a one-week deployment of a shared, anonymous heart rate variability (HRV) data visualization system at six workplaces with 24 office workers, who were closely collaborated in four-person groups. We collected stress-related physiology data (i.e., heart-rate variability) from wearable sensors and anonymously visualized them on a shared display. Although the physiological data collection where noisy due to the practical constraints in the field settings, we found the participants still increasingly agreed with the systems and used the visualization as a reference for their subjective stress assessment. We also present and discuss how groups of office workers individually and socially reflect on their one-week experiences and then summarize takeaways for designing shared physiological data visualization systems for group stress management in the long term.

The Electronicists: Techno-aesthetic Encounters for Nonlinear and Art-based Inquiry in HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517506,3,https://sjackson.infosci.cornell.edu/KangJacksonPinch_TheElectronicists(CHI2022).pdf,"
This paper offers a theoretical and methodological framework of ‘techno-aesthetic encounters’ that supports nonlinear (situated, materially-driven, and multi-sensory) and art-based modes of inquiry in HCI and the broader STEM fields. We first investigate recent literatures in HCI and science and technology studies (STS) that explore nonlinear modes of practice and creativity in processes of technology design, and argue that better recognition of these dynamics may open space for art-based and nonlinear leaners and makers to more actively engage in HCI research and design. To meet this need, we study three renowned art-and-engineering practitioners (Klüver, Paik, Moog) and our own experimental project titled ‘The Electronicists’ in which participants from different disciplines collaborated to produce three hybrid works. Based on this work, we propose a framework of ‘techno-aesthetic encounters’ that pursues event-based creativity through the mediation of engineering, art, and humanistic engagements. We suggest trust-based experiments, error-engaged studio, and art-based ethnography as promising methodological tenets of this approach.

Platformisation of Digital Financial Services (DFS): The Journey of DFS in the Global North and Global South,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516507,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pranjal-Jain-12/publication/360408359_Platformisation_of_Digital_Financial_Services_DFS_The_Journey_of_DFS_in_the_Global_North_and_Global_South/links/6278612a973bbb29cc6d6984/Platformisation-of-Digital-Financial-Services-DFS-The-Journey-of-DFS-in-the-Global-North-and-Global-South.pdf,"
 The digitization of financial transactions in both Global North and Global South has led to considerable shifts in how money is used, understood, and processed by users, banks, and fintechs. This shift from physical cash to digital media, accelerated by the COVID-19 push for digital transactions, has impacted how users perceive and use digital money and opened avenues for more data collection. This diverse panel proposes a discussion to understand the set of opportunities and challenges around the design of digital financial services (DFS) and data-driven decision-making in DFS. We will create a live working document starting before the panel to document the discussion, which develops during and after the panel. This live document will enable community to engage with a broader audience of researchers and industry, outlining processes, methods, and tools that researchers and practitioners have created to work with users to develop new equitable DFS and further exploration.

Element: An Ambient Display System for Evoking Self-Reflections and Supporting Social-Interactions in a Workspace,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519721,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/hextjdt6unbtxpfcuzjywn3eku/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519721,"
In this paper, we present the design of Element, an ambient display system that displays the user’s emotional engagement level through color and shape change on a light fixture. Given the increasing number of people who experience exhaustion or burnout in professional contexts, our goal is to design an interface that helps people keep track of their engagements through an ambient display of real-time physiological data. We conduct two qualitative studies to investigate its possible benefits and users’ concerns from an individual perspective and social contexts with multiple users. The result shows that our design can not only aid users’ self-reflections and discovery on the intrapersonal level, it also shows the potential to help participants understand others’ emotional engagement and provide vital support when needed. Interestingly, our findings also highlighted the ethical concerns of displaying personal data in a public space. Reflecting on this crucial challenge, we also propose three social guidelines for helping users establish positive mindsets and cultures of using Element appropriately in sociotechnical environments.

Assisting Teaching Assistants with Automatic Code Corrections,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501820,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501820,"
 Undergraduate Teaching Assistants(TAs) in Computer Science courses are often the first and only point of contact when a student gets stuck on a programming problem. But these TAs are often relative beginners themselves, both in programming and in teaching. In this paper, we examine the impact of availability of corrected code on TAs’ ability to find, fix, and address bugs in student code. We found that seeing a corrected version of the student code helps TAs debug code 29% faster, and write more accurate and complete student-facing explanations of the bugs (30% more likely to correctly address a given bug). We also observed that TAs do not generally struggle with the conceptual understanding of the underlying material. Rather, their difficulties seem more related to issues with working memory, attention, and overall high cognitive load.

“Merging Results Is No Easy Task”: An International Survey Study of Collaborative Data Analysis Practices Among UX Practitioners,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517647,3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02823,"
Analysis is a key part of usability testing where UX practitioners seek to identify usability problems and generate redesign suggestions. Although previous research reported how analysis was conducted, the findings were typically focused on individual analysis or based on a small number of professionals in specific geographic regions. We conducted an online international survey of 279 UX practitioners on their practices and challenges while collaborating during data analysis. We found that UX practitioners were often under time pressure to conduct analysis and adopted three modes of collaboration: independently analyze different portions of the data and then collaborate, collaboratively analyze the session with little or no independent analysis, and independently analyze the same set of data and then collaborate. Moreover, most encountered challenges related to lack of resources, disagreements with colleagues regarding usability problems, and difficulty merging analysis from multiple practitioners. We discuss design implications to better support collaborative data analysis.

Understanding User Mental Models Through App Sketches from Memory,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519753,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519753,"
User-generated sketches serve as a powerful lens for understanding users’ mental models of apps and services. Inspired by research on hand-drawn maps of cities, we conducted an exploratory study in which 123 participants drew the interface of a popular mobile app from memory. An analysis of the resulting sketches highlights that these types of artifacts can be used to understand which elements are most central to users’ understanding of the app's core features and architecture—including non-existent features from other apps and services. We discuss how this work can be applied to the design of mobile apps and describe areas of future research.

StoryBox: Independent Multi-modal Interactive Storytelling for Children with Visual Impairment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519651,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/fw35a5pctvdelmgdoobuhbt4cm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519651,"
 Storytelling promotes the development of imagination and creativity and facilitates the impregnation of linguistic, emotional and moral skills in children. Limited storytelling media for children with blindness and visual impairment (BVI) confines their access to this unique experience. StoryBox is a multi-modal storytelling agent, facilitating an independent and interactive storytelling experience for children (5-12 years) with BVI. The platform supports audio-based story narration and enables tangible interaction with story elements via sensor-enabled tactile clay figurines. StoryBox takes inspiration from ‘kaavad baanchana’ - an oral storytelling tradition from Rajasthan, India. This paper presents the design of the proposed accessible multi-modal storytelling platform and findings from initial user evaluation with blindfolded participants.

Effect of contact points feedback on two-thumb touch typing in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519794,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/iz5dkoypofgyxnqip7ewjriupe/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519794,"
 Two-thumb touch typing (4T) is a touchpad-based text-entry technique also used in virtual reality (VR) systems. However, the performance of 4T in VR is far below that of 4T in a real environment, such as on a smartphone. Unlike “real 4T”, 4T in VR provides virtual cursors representing the thumb positions determined by a position tracker. The virtual cursor positions may differ from the thumb contact points on an input surface. Still, users may regard them as their thumb contact points. In this case, the virtual cursor movements may conflict with the thumb movements perceived by their proprioception and may contribute to typing errors. We hypothesized that virtual cursors accurately representing the contact points of the thumb can improve the performance of 4T in VR. We designed a method to provide accurate contact point feedback, and showed that accurate contact point feedback has a statistically significant positive effect on the speed of 4T in VR.

Auditory and Olfactory Stimuli-Based Attractors to Induce Reorientation in Virtual Reality Forward Redirected Walking,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519719,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519719,"
Redirected walking (RDW) visually manipulates the virtual environment to imperceptibly redirect the walkers to keep them in the tracking area, and offers a larger space than physical space. An attractor is a redirected walking technique that captures the walker's attention and manipulates the walker's trajectory through rotational gain. However, the attractor visually manipulates the walker's virtual environment using a predefined rotational gain, and having to constantly gaze at the attractor or the attractor frequently appearing until the walker's direction matches the desired direction, are problems limiting the application of visual attractors. Moreover, when the walker is unable to recognize or ignores the attractor, reorientation fails. In this study, we designed a human-sense-stimulating attractor that utilizes the auditory and olfactory senses to improve the rotational gain, naturalness, and immersion and decrease the chance of reorientation failure. Although sound and scents are invisible, they can be detected through direction; however, humans cannot recognize the accurate direction of a sound or scent. Based on these characteristics, auditory and olfactory attractors are proposed. We measured the amount of reorientation induced by the auditory and olfactory attractors and calculated the reorientation success rate. Additionally, the naturalness and immersion of the attractor were evaluated. The auditory attractor has a high reorientation success rate, naturalness, and immersion. The olfactory attractor induces more turn changes in the walker than other attractors, and a high number of turn changes leads to a larger rotational gain. Auditory and olfactory-based attractors have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of visual attractors such as the frequent interventions.

Extracting handwritten annotations from printed documents via infrared scanning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519872,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519872,"
Despite ever improving digital ink and paper solutions, many people still prefer printing out documents for close reading, proofreading, or filling out forms. However, in order to incorporate paper-based annotations into digital workflows, handwritten text and markings need to be extracted. Common computer-vision and machine-learning approaches require extensive sets of training data or a clean digital version of the document. We propose a simple method for extracting handwritten annotations from laser-printed documents using multispectral imaging. While black toner absorbs infrared light, most inks are invisible in the infrared spectrum. We modified an off-the-shelf flatbed scanner by adding a switchable infrared LED to its light guide. By subtracting an infrared scan from a color scan, handwritten text and highlighting can be extracted and added to a PDF version. Initial experiments show accurate results with high quality on a test data set of 93 annotated pages. Thus, infrared scanning seems like a promising building block for integrating paper-based and digital annotation practices.

BIGexplore: Bayesian information gain framework for information exploration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517729,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517729,"
 The Bayesian information gain (BIG) framework has garnered significant interest as an interaction method for predicting a user’s intended target based on a user’s input. However, the BIG framework is constrained to goal-oriented cases, which renders it difficult to support changing goal-oriented cases such as design exploration. During the design exploration process, the design direction is often undefined and may vary over time. The designer’s mental model specifying the design direction is sequentially updated through the information-retrieval process. Therefore, tracking the change point of a user’s goal is crucial for supporting an information exploration. We introduce the BIGexplore framework for changing goal-oriented cases. BIGexplore detects transitions in a user’s browsing behavior as well as the user’s next target. Furthermore, a user study on BIGexplore confirms that the computational cost is significantly reduced compared with the existing BIG framework, and it plausibly detects the point where the user changes goals.

 Online petitions have served as an innovative means of citizen participation over the past decade. However, their original purpose has been waning due to inappropriate language, fabricated information, and the lack of evidence that supports petitions. The lack of deliberation in online petitions has influenced other users, deteriorating the platform to a degree that good petitions are seldom generated. Therefore, this study designs interventions that empower users to create deliberative petitions. We conducted user research to observe users’ writing behavior in online petitions and identified causes of non-deliberative petitions. Based on our findings, we propose ThinkWrite, a new interactive app promoting user deliberation. The app includes six main features: a gamified learning process, a writing recommendation system, a guiding interface for self-construction, tailored AI for self-revision, short-cuts for easy archiving of evidence, and a citizen-collaborative page. Finally, the efficacy of the app is demonstrated through user surveys and in-depth interviews.

Revisiting Engagement in Humanitarian Mapping: An Updated Analysis of Contributor Retention in OpenStreetMap,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519728,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/85360141/3491101.pdf,"
This study revisits findings of the 2016 paper by Dittus et al. that considered trends in contributor retention in humanitarian mapping projects organized using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. In addition to revisiting many of the same metrics used for the 2017-2020 time period, our research takes on a broader scope by evaluating a wider cohort of recruits, as opposed to specific projects evaluated by the original paper. As a result, our findings offer an updated and more complete picture of contributor retention in humanitarian mapping projects. We also offer several insights and future research opportunities for long-term contributor retention in online peer production projects.

 We are now entering the new space age! In 2021, for the first time in history that there is civilian crew in space, demonstrating the next frontier of human space exploration that will not be restricted to highly trained astronauts but will be open to a more general public. However, keeping a human healthy, happy and productive in space is one of the most challenging aspects of current space programs [11]. Thus, there is an emerging opportunity for researchers in HCI to design and research new types of interactive systems and computer interfaces that can support humans living and working in space and elsewhere in the solar system.  Last year, SpaceCHI workshop (https://spacechi.media.mit.edu/) at CHI 2021 welcomed over 130 participants from 20 countries around the world to present new ideas and discuss future possibilities for human-computer interaction for space exploration. The SpaceCHI 1.0, for the first time, brought together crossdisciplinary researchers from HCI, aerospace engineering, robotics, biological science, design, art, architecture to envision the future of human space exploration leading the workshop participants and organizers to form a new global community focused on HCI research for space applications. With success from the previous SpaceCHI, we are exploring the exciting opportunity for researchers in HCI to contribute to the great endeavor of space exploration by participating in our workshop.

"Trust, reciprocity, and the role of timebanks as intermediaries: Design implications for addressing healthcare transportation barriers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502494,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502494,"
 Millions of Americans forego medical care due to a lack of non-emergency transportation, particularly minorities, older adults, and those who have disabilities or chronic conditions. Our study investigates the potential for using timebanks—community-based voluntary services that encourage exchanges of services for “time dollars” rather than money—in interventions to address healthcare transportation barriers to seed design implications for a future affordable ridesharing platform. In partnership with a timebank and a federally qualified healthcare center (FQHC), 30 participants completed activity packets and 29 of them attended online workshop sessions. Our findings suggest that promoting trust between drivers and riders requires systems that prioritize safety and reliability; yet, there were discrepancies in the ability of the timebank and FQHC to moderate trust. We also found that timebank supports reciprocity, but healthcare transportation requires additional support to ensure balanced reciprocity. We explain these findings drawing from network closure and trust literature. Finally, we contribute design implications for systems that promote trust and facilitate relational over transactional interactions, which help to promote reciprocity and reflect participants’ values.

Leveraging Transformative Justice in Organizing Collective Action Towards Community Safety,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503820,2,,"
 Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism. Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated how the design of technologies for community safety can resist structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to traditional policing activities, including story-telling, community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of building safer communities. This is an area of great potential— just as community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ, my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.

Multi-modal Conversational Search for People with Intellectual Disability: An Exploratory Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519821,1,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/233719/1/CHI_LBW_2022_Conversational_Search.pdf,"
 Like us all, people with intellectual disability are self-motivated learning and are enthusiastic information seekers. However, there are some technical challenges for people with intellectual disability when accessing required information and interacting with conversational search systems. This paper presents the preliminary development of a simulated multi-modal conversational search system to understand its potentials and limitations for people with intellectual disability. To conduct an exploratory study, we developed a Wizard of Oz conversational multi-modal system which records user activities, including touch, text and verbal interactions. Then, we preliminary evaluated the system with eight adults with intellectual disability in one of two different information-seeking scenarios – in an individual and collaborative setting. Drawing on the findings and insights of the study, participants valued the system as it fulfilled their information retrieval needs, and it achieved an acceptable level of accessibility. These findings and future research into this topic can guide accessibility improvements to current search systems and the development of future conversational search systems.

Pretty princess vs. successful leader: Gender roles in greeting card messages,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502114,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502114,"
People write personalized greeting cards on various occasions. While prior work has studied gender roles in greeting card messages, systematic analysis at scale and tools for raising the awareness of gender stereotyping remain under-investigated. To this end, we collect a large greeting card message corpus covering three different occasions (birthday, Valentine’s Day and wedding) from three sources (exemplars from greeting message websites, real-life greetings from social media and language model generated ones). We uncover a wide range of gender stereotypes in this corpus via topic modeling, odds ratio and Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). We further conduct a survey to understand people’s perception of gender roles in messages from this corpus and if gender stereotyping is a concern. The results show that people want to be aware of gender roles in the messages, but remain unconcerned unless the perceived gender roles conflict with the recipient’s true personality. In response, we developed GreetA, an interactive visualization and writing assistant tool to visualize fine-grained topics in greeting card messages drafted by the users and the associated gender perception scores, but without suggesting text changes as an intervention.

Consent in the Age of AR: Investigating The Comfort With Displaying Personal Information in Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502140,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502140,"
 Social Media (SM) has shown that we adapt our communication and disclosure behaviors to available technological opportunities. Head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) will soon allow to effortlessly display the information we disclosed not isolated from our physical presence (e.g., on a smartphone) but visually attached to the human body. In this work, we explore how the medium (AR vs. Smartphone), our role (being augmented vs. augmenting), and characteristics of information types (e.g., level of intimacy, self-disclosed vs. non-self-disclosed) impact the users’ comfort when displaying personal information. Conducting an online survey (N=148), we found that AR technology and being augmented negatively impacted this comfort. Additionally, we report that AR mitigated the effects of information characteristics compared to those they had on smartphones. In light of our results, we discuss that information augmentation should be built on consent and openness, focusing more on the comfort of the augmented rather than the technological possibilities.

An exploratory study of sharing strategic programming knowledge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502070,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502070,"
 In many domains, strategic knowledge is documented and shared through checklists and handbooks. In software engineering, however, developers rarely share strategic knowledge for approaching programming problems, in contrast to other artifacts and despite its importance to productivity and success. To understand barriers to sharing, we simulated a programming strategy knowledge-sharing platform, asking experienced developers to articulate a programming strategy and others to use these strategies while providing feedback. Throughout, we asked strategy authors and users to reflect on the challenges they faced. Our analysis revealed that developers could share strategic knowledge. However, they struggled in choosing a level of detail and understanding the diversity of the potential audience. While authors required substantial feedback, users struggled to give it and authors to interpret it. Our results suggest that sharing strategic knowledge differs from sharing code and raises challenging questions about how knowledge-sharing platforms should support search and feedback.

This course takes both a practical and theoretical approach to introduce the principles, methods and tools for automation design. Automation is pervasive in interactive applications as it can high benefits to the users. However, bad designs jeopardize these benefits and induce human errors (e.g. automation surprises). This course will explain how to design automation and how to assess its pros and cons in terms of user-related properties such as usability, user experience, acceptance or trust. Examples are taken from industries that have been embedding automation in their systems for a long time (such as aviation, automotive, satellite ground segments …) and interactive hands-on exercises will explain how to ""do it right"".

Outsourcing Artificial Intelligence: Responding to the Reassertion of the Human Element into Automation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503720,1,,"
Science fiction imaginaries and Silicon Valley innovators have long envisioned a workerless future. However, this industrial ambition has often outpaced technological realities in robotics and artificial intelligence, leading to a reassertion of human skills to cover untenable gaps in autonomous systems. This one-day workshop will invite discussion on this recent retrograde trend toward precarious (and often concealed) human labour across such domains as agriculture, transportation, and caregiving through paper presentations and design activities. Throughout, we will ask how this phenomenon speaks to engineering and design challenges and, subsequently, encourage participants to ideate new cybernetic arrangements that centre the agency and well-being of essential workers.

How Interest-Driven Content Creation Shapes Opportunities for Informal Learning in Scratch: A Case Study on Novices' Use of Data Structures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502124,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502124,"
Through a mixed-method analysis of data from Scratch, we examine how novices learn to program with simple data structures by using community-produced learning resources. First, we present a qualitative study that describes how community-produced learning resources create archetypes that shape exploration and may disadvantage some with less common interests. In a second quantitative study, we find broad support for this dynamic in several hypothesis tests. Our findings identify a social feedback loop that we argue could limit sources of inspiration, pose barriers to broadening participation, and confine learners’ understanding of general concepts. We conclude by suggesting several approaches that may mitigate these dynamics.

Aiding Intimate Violence Survivors in Lockdown: Lessons about Digital Security in the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503548,2,,"
The global pandemic and associated lockdown measures created new and severe forms of vulnerability for people living in the context of intimate partner violence and coercive control, including being trapped in their homes with abusers and struggling to access advocates as services moved online. This paper outlines innovations used by victim advocates and service providers in reaching survivors in often impossible circumstances, and summarizes lessons from the design of a safety-planning application named “myPlan”. We propose digital security guidelines for products and services which may be used by survivors cohabiting with abusers or using devices which may be under surveillance. We conclude with reflections on whether technology design leads to empowerment: although we cannot overstate the importance of digital security design which is sensitive to the unique vulnerabilities of marginalized people, true empowerment requires a greater commitment to funding accessible housing, mental health support, and advocacy.

IT-Supported Request Management for Clinical Radiology: Contextual Design and Remote Prototype Testing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503571,1,,"
 Management of radiology requests in larger clinical contexts is characterized by a complex and distributed workflow. In our partner hospital, representing many similar clinics, these processes often still rely on exchanging physical papers and forms, making patient or case data challenging to access. This often leads to phone calls with long waiting queues, which are time-inefficient and result in frequent interrupts. We report on a user-centered design approach based on Rapid Contextual Design with an additional focus group to optimize and iteratively develop a new workflow. Participants found our prototypes fast and intuitive, the design clean and consistent, relevant information easy to access, and the request process fast and easy. Due to the COVID pandemic, we switched to remote prototype testing, which yielded equally good feedback and increased the participation rate. In the end, we propose best practices for remote prototype testing in hospitals with complex and distributed workflows.

 Recommender systems assist users by providing recommendations based on some filtration criteria to reduce information overload. Embedding context-awareness allows recommender systems to use context information around the user, situation, and system to adapt and provide more efficient, relevant, and personalized recommendations. However, embedding context-awareness into recommender systems inherently limits the users‘ control over the systems due to reduced interactivity from automatic adaptations. This may potentially impact users’ use and perception of the systems. Control can be purposefully designed to be given to the user in context-aware recommender systems at different levels. Our work investigates the effects of different levels of user control on the effectiveness and understandability of context-aware recommender systems (CARS) within the scenario of learning through web-based search (called ‘Search-As-Learning’). To enable our study, we implemented a CARS that supports web-based search by recommending users a link using context such as browsing history. Our study found that participants used more recommendations from the CARS with high control compared to no control and some control. In conclusion, higher control in a recommender system for web-based search is preferred by the user despite control manipulation taking more time possibly due to explicit user needs.

Quantifying Proactive and Reactive Button Input,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501913,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/lrm5ukembfcyxnuziyfgnatx7u/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501913,"
 When giving input with a button, users follow one of two strategies: (1) react to the output from the computer or (2) proactively act in anticipation of the output from the computer. We propose a technique to quantify reactiveness and proactiveness to determine the degree and characteristics of each input strategy. The technique proposed in this study uses only screen recordings and does not require instrumentation beyond the input logs. The likelihood distribution of the time interval between the button inputs and system outputs, which is uniquely determined for each input strategy, is modeled. Then the probability that each observed input/output pair originates from a specific strategy is estimated along with the parameters of the corresponding likelihood distribution. In two empirical studies, we show how to use the technique to answer questions such as how to design animated transitions and how to predict a player’s score in real-time games.

Cognality VR: Exploring a Mobile VR App with Multiple Stakeholders to Reduce Meltdowns in Autistic Children,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519742,1,https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=engineering_articles,"
Many autistic children can have difficulty communicating, understanding others, and interacting with new and unfamiliar environments. At times they may suffer from a meltdown. The major contributing factor to meltdowns is sensory overwhelm. Technological solutions have shown promise in improving the quality of life for autistic children-however little exists to manage meltdowns. In this work with stakeholders, we design and deploy a low cost, mobile VR application to provide relief during sensory discomfort. Through the analysis of surveys from 88 stakeholders from a variety of groups (i.e., autistic adults, children with autism, parents of autistic individuals, and medical practitioners), we identified three key features regarding ways to manage meltdowns: escape, distract, and wait it out. These insights were implementation in a system, then was then remotely deployed with 6 families. Findings and future steps are discussed.

“Hartal (Strike) Happens Here Everyday”: Understanding Impact of Disruption on Education in Kashmir,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502126,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/4sab726ms5cdflaotwifcl2r74/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502126,"
 Sustainable Development Goal 4 promotes inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all. However, regions with ongoing socio-political conflict suffer disruption to education and learning. We situate our work in Kashmir, India, affected by socio-political conflict for more than three decades. We did multiple field visits and conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with parents, teachers, students, and members of a non-government organization that runs Community Learning Centers in Kashmir. Our findings present the barriers in education caused by disruption and the role of community learning centers in overcoming the barriers within these contextual constraints. Further, we discuss engaging researchers and policymakers to leverage human infrastructure, embedding uncertainty into the design, infrastructuring trust, and content usability to develop solutions to make education more accessible. Despite significant research in HCI and Education, research in this particular context is under-explored, and our work contributes to filling this gap.

"“As Uploaders, We Have the Responsibility”: Individualized Professionalization of Bilibili Uploaders",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517509,3,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/265294/1/265294.pdf,"
 The prevalence of social media blurs the boundaries between consumer and producer, work and play, and leads to new social roles, professions, and identities (e.g. blogger, YouTuber, micro-celebrity). However, we still lack a clear understanding of how people come to identify with these new roles and how individual professional development is digitally mediated. This paper presents a study based on Bilibili, a popular Chinese social media platform featuring user-generated videos, and highlights a professionalization process through which individuals consciously distinguish between the roles of uploaders and consumers, develop a shared work ethos around the role of the uploader, and, as uploaders, improve their technical-professional expertise. We conclude by discussing individualized professionalization as a concept that describes the bottom-up and community-based process of professional development for User Generated Content (UGC) taking place in contemporary digital media environments.

Opportunities in designing HCI tools for lactation consulting professionals,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519762,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519762,"
 Long-term breastfeeding has been shown to exhibit several environmental benefits and health benefits for both the mother and baby. Despite the known advantages, several mothers choose not to maintain breastfeeding long-term. How long a mother breastfeeds is heavily influenced by lactation and latching, and so the mother’s critical point of support is the lactation consultant (LC), who guides and provides instruction for creating a more positive breastfeeding experience. Empowering lactation consultants with methods to deliver instruction and support remotely is essential for advancing telehealth and wide-scale adoption. This paper presents findings from a need-finding study of 6 LC’s that sheds light on ways to address some of the challenges faced by the LC community when providing remote lactation support. Based on the interviews, a number of potential technologies were identified around wearable sensing, annotation tools, and digital repository for virtual education.

Vibration-augmented buttons: Information transmission capacity and application to interaction design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501849,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/lubepovvkveihhyegqq72xa7he/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501849,"
One can embed a vibration actuator to a physical button and augment the physical button’s original kinesthetic response with a programmable vibration generated by the actuator. Such vibration-augmented buttons inherit the advantages of both physical and virtual buttons. This paper reports the information transmission capacity of vibration-augmented buttons. It was obtained by conducting a series of absolute identification experiments while increasing the number of augmented buttons. The information transmission capacity found was 2.6 bits, and vibration-augmented and physical buttons showed similar abilities in rendering easily recognizable haptic responses. In addition, we showcase a VR text entry application that utilizes vibration-augmented buttons. Our method provides several error messages to the user during text entry using a VR controller that includes an augmented button. We validate that the variable haptic feedback improves task performance, cognitive workload, and user experience for a transcription task.

 Location-based advertising (LBA), such as billboards and signage, has long been a direct-to-consumer advertising staple. As locative media such as Location-Based Games (LBG) begins to rise in prominence, digital LDA becomes increasingly appealing. In this paper, we explore the impacts of LBA on small businesses in the LBG Pokémon GO, a lacuna in the literature. We gather participant experience through a collection of 35 semi-structured interviews with businesses leveraging Niantic’s sponsored location LBA. These testimonies indicate (1) participant businesses found LBG advertising to be satisfactory, (2) LBG advertising improves brand recognizability for local commerce, and (3) local community is an important factor for success in LBG advertising. These findings indicate future patterns for integrating local businesses into LBG like Pokémon GO, suggesting potential for LBG advertising to assist local businesses.

Prototyping Exoskeleton Interaction for Game-based Rehabilitation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503566,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/87242402/3491101.pdf,"
 Exoskeletons are increasingly used for rehabilitation. To support the design of new and engaging ways of interacting with an exoskeleton, we have developed a low-cost toolkit that interfaces a LEGO Technic arm exoskeleton with serious gaming. The toolkit enables easy modifications and options for the integration of a range of sensors. Additionally, it can be applied for use in gaming via a screen display or virtual reality (VR) systems. The toolkit provides real-time data streaming valuable for researchers and clinicians to analyze how the exoskeleton is being used. We present two case studies with the exoskeleton being used as an input and output interface for serious gaming.

Identifying Game Mechanics for Integrating Fabrication Activities within Existing Digital Games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517721,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3517721,"
Integrating fabrication activities into existing video games provides opportunities for players to construct objects from their gameplay and bring the digital content into the physical world. In our prior work, we outlined a framework and developed a toolkit for integrating fabrication activities within existing digital games. Insights from our prior study highlighted the challenge of aligning fabrication mechanics with the existing game mechanics in order to strengthen the player aesthetics.  In this paper, we address this challenge and build on our prior work by adding fabrication components to the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework. We use this f-MDA framework to analyze the 47 fabrication events from the prior study. We list the new player-object aesthetics that emerge from integrating the existing game mechanics with fabrication mechanics. We identify connections between these emergent player-object aesthetics and the existing game mechanics. We discuss how designers can use this mapping to identify potential game mechanics for integrating with fabrication activities.

 Wearable biosignal monitoring systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as tools for autonomous health monitoring and other real-world applications. Despite the continual advancements in this field, anthropometric considerations for women’s form are often overlooked in the design process, making systems ill fit and less effective. In this paper, we present a full garment assembly, ARGONAUT, with integrated textile electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes in a 3-lead configuration that is designed specifically for women’s form. Through the exploration of materials, anthropometry, and garment assembly, we designed and tested ARGONAUT against the laboratory standard to determine performance through R-peak detection and noise interference. We investigated common issues faced when designing a wearable ECG garment, such as fit, motion artifact mitigation, and social wearability, to develop a dynamic design process that can be used to expand the advancing technology sensor integrated garments to all individuals in order to allow for equal access to potential health benefits.

Maker technology and the promise of empowerment in a Flemish School for Disabled Children,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501853,3,https://scholar.archive.org/work/b4uj3ud75jf2xhwgmy4kdipdni/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501853,"
Maker culture encourages do-it-yourself practices to create, repair, and repurpose technology. In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, it is seen as a means of empowering people, providing affordable and customisable technology with potential to enrich areas such as education or assistive technology. To investigate this alleged potential, we performed an anthropological inquiry at an elementary school for disabled children that lasted one year, participating in everyday activities with students, teachers, and therapists. We observed ‘heterogeneity in a fluid environment’ and ‘creativity in the moment’ in an ‘endemically underfunded’ setting. We saw how technology is ‘injecting dependencies’, ‘reinforcing disability’, and ‘occupying time and space’, changing our view on the role that making can have. Leveraging Empowerment Theory, we highlight how (making) technology risks ignoring the intertwined dynamics between the individual, the organisational, and the community, and articulate points for reflection for technology in schools for disabled children for the HCI research community.

DNA-based digital data storage technology is hailed as a potential solution for the issues around exponential global data production. However, while the technology continues to strive towards its full commercialization, there is a lack of discourse on how it could be applied to facilitate interactions that are meaningful, ethical, and socially sustainable. As an approach to address this gap, we hosted a series of online workshops, soliciting 15 participants to engage in grounded speculations on plausible futures of DNA data storage. Themes drawn from the resulting imaginaries and discussions were situated within a selection of existing HCI literature, to generate an initial set of design opportunities and challenges for DNA data storage. Early analysis suggests that the system could be designed to 1) facilitate meaningful interactions that are intangible and molecular, and 2) foster better human relationship with more-than-human entities. Furthermore, we highlight the imperative for cross-disciplinary collaborations and pedagogy, to ensure fair and high quality access to the technology.

 Mobile Robotic Telepresence (MRP) systems are remotely controlled, mobile videoconferencing devices that allow the remote user to move independently and have a physical presence in the environment. This paper presents a longitudinal study of MRP use in the home, where the first author used an MRP to connect with family, her partner, and friends over a six-month period. Taking an ethnomethodological approach, we present video recorded fragments to explore the phenomenon of ‘visiting’ where MRP users drop into the home for a period of time. We unpack the more ‘procedural’ elements—arriving and departing—alongside ways of ‘dwelling’ together during a visit, and the qualities of mobility, autonomous presence and spontaneity that emerge.

Visguide: User-oriented recommendations for data event extraction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517648,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3491102.3517648,"
 Data exploration systems have become popular tools with which data analysts and others can explore raw data and organize their observations. However, users of such systems who are unfamiliar with their datasets face several challenges when trying to extract data events of interest to them. Those challenges include progressively discovering informative charts, organizing them into a logical order to depict a meaningful fact, and arranging one or more facts to illustrate a data event. To alleviate them, we propose VisGuide—a data exploration system that generates personalized recommendations to aid users’ discovery of data events in breadth and depth by incrementally learning their data exploration preferences and recommending meaningful charts tailored to them. As well as user preferences, VisGuide’s recommendations simultaneously consider sequence organization and chart presentation. We conducted two user studies to evaluate 1) the usability of VisGuide and 2) user satisfaction with its recommendation system. The results of those studies indicate that VisGuide can effectively help users create coherent and user-oriented visualization trees that represent meaningful data events.

How HCI Adopts Service Design: Unpacking current perceptions and scopes of service design in HCI and identifying future opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502128,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502128,"
Service design has gained tractions in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as an approach to deal with changes of technology design scopes. In the meantime, there are confusions around definitions of service design and its relevance to HCI. Despite the co-existence of interests and confusions, little research has been done for a comprehensive overview of how HCI interprets and adopts service design. This research performed a systematic literature review on extant HCI publications that claim to use service design. The review findings from the 179 publications revealed varying dimensions of service design taken up in HCI, relations between service design scopes and emerging technologies, as well as unclarity to service design in HCI and HCI's current tendency to use service design for the interaction level rather than the system level. We discuss future design and research opportunities for HCI by integrating the system level dimensions of service design.

If the map fits! exploring minimaps as distractors from non-euclidean spaces in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519621,1,https://uwe-gruenefeld.de/pub/noneuclidean-paper.pdf,"
 With non-Euclidean spaces, Virtual Reality (VR) experiences can more efficiently exploit the available physical space by using overlapping virtual rooms. However, the illusion created by these spaces can be discovered, if the overlap is too large. Thus, in this work, we investigate if users can be distracted from the overlap by showing a minimap that suggests that there is none. When done correctly, more VR space can be mapped into the existing physical space, allowing for more spacious virtual experiences. Through a user study, we found that participants uncovered the overlap of two virtual rooms when it was at 100% or the overlapping room extended even further. Our results show that the additional minimap renders overlapping virtual rooms more believable and can serve as a helpful tool to use physical space more efficiently for natural locomotion in VR.

RoleSeer: Understanding Informal Social Role Changes in MMORPGs via Visual Analytics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517712,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517712,"
 Massively multiplayer online role-playing games create virtual communities that support heterogeneous “social roles” determined by gameplay interaction behaviors under a specific social context. For all social roles, formal roles are pre-defined, obvious, and explicitly ascribed to the people holding the roles, whereas informal roles are not well-defined and unspoken. Identifying the informal roles and understanding their subtle changes are critical to designing sociability mechanisms. However, it is nontrivial to understand the existence and evolution of such roles due to their loosely defined, interconvertible, and dynamic characteristics. We propose a visual analytics system, RoleSeer, to investigate informal roles from the perspectives of behavioral interactions and depict their dynamic interconversions and transitions. Two cases, experts’ feedback, and a user study suggest that RoleSeer helps interpret the identified informal roles and explore the patterns behind role changes. We see our approach’s potential in investigating informal roles in a broader range of social games.

Select or Suggest? Reinforcement Learning-based Method for High-Accuracy Target Selection on Touchscreens,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517472,2,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10337972,"
 Suggesting multiple target candidates based on touch input is a possible option for high-accuracy target selection on small touchscreen devices. But it can become overwhelming if suggestions are triggered too often. To address this, we propose SATS, a Suggestion-based Accurate Target Selection method, where target selection is formulated as a sequential decision problem. The objective is to maximize the utility: the negative time cost for the entire target selection procedure. The SATS decision process is dictated by a policy generated using reinforcement learning. It automatically decides when to provide suggestions and when to directly select the target. Our user studies show that SATS reduced error rate and selection time over Shift [51], a magnification-based method, and MUCS, a suggestion-based alternative that optimizes the utility for the current selection. SATS also significantly reduced error rate over BayesianCommand [58], which directly selects targets based on posteriors, with only a minor increase in selection time.

Playing games through interactive data comics to explore water quality in a lake: A case study exploring the use of a data-driven storytelling method in Co-design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503561,1,https://lutpub.lut.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/165352/hasan_et_al_playing_games_aam.pdf?sequence=1,"
This case study explores the use of an existing data-driven storytelling method, called data comic, within a co-design process, to improve the sense-making of data. Data can often support a co-design process by providing additional insight towards a problem that is being solved. A large number of methods are available to facilitate different aspects of a co-design process, but when it comes to embedding curated data, alternatives are limited. Not everyone has the expertise to understand raw data and co-design scenarios are typically time-limited meaning that learning new data skills is not the focus. Therefore, appropriate data curation can help to bring data into a design process while reducing time spent on data manipulation or upskilling. At the same time, it is important that participants are encouraged to think critically about the data and not simply accept a pre-determined viewpoint. We have adapted an existing technique called Data Comic for curating data for use in a co-design situation by turning the comic panels into a card game so that they can be used interactively and collaboratively. In this paper, we describe and reflect on its use within a workshop with participants who were mostly teenagers. We led them through a process of engaging with curated data to make sense of water pollution in a Finnish lake since the 1970s and raise awareness towards environmental pollution. We present our results from the participant's feedback and workshop to reflect on how data comics played a role in sense-making.

 Selfies have become a prominent means of online communication. Group selfies, in particular, encourage people to represent their identity as part of the group and foster a sense of belonging. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing systems are used as a tool for group selfies. However, conventional systems are not ideal for group selfies due to the rigidness of grid-based layout, information overload, and lack of eye contact. To explore design opportunities and needs for a novel virtual group selfie platform, we conducted a participatory design, and identified three characteristics of virtual group selfie scenarios, “context with narratives”, “interactive group tasks”, and “capturing subtle moments.” We implemented Virfie, a web-based platform that enables users to take group selfies with embodied social interaction, and to create and customize selfie scenarios using a novel JSON specification. In order to validate our design concept and identify usability issues we conducted a user study. Feedbacks from the study participants suggest that Virfie is effective at strengthening social interaction and remote togetherness.

Communicating risk to the public in the lead-up to tropical storms has the potential to significantly reduce the impacts on both livelihood and property. While significant research has been conducted in the storm risk community on how people receive, seek, and utilize risk information, given the importance of computing technologies and social media in these activities, human-centered design stands to make important contributions to this area. Drawing on an extensive literature review and 48 interviews with hurricane experts and members of the public, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a broad overview of hurricane risk communication. We then offer a set of guiding insights to inform HCI research work in this domain. Finally, we identify 6 opportunities that future human centered design work might pursue. In sum, this paper offers an invitation and a starting point for HCI to take up the problem of hurricane risk communication.

Mental health applications (apps) show a good potential to help people suffering from a variety of mental illnesses. Most existing apps focus on people from developed countries. Our research contributes by focusing on underserved populations - Indian Working-Class Women. This study aims at creating a stress and anxiety management application for working-class Indian women (people who are a part of the workforce). We conducted a one-on-one interview with 31 working-class Indian women. Participants highlighted household chores and workload as major sources of stress/anxiety for them. The results also highlight several features required in mental health apps by this group including mood tracking features, social community features. Participants highlighted some concerns with existing mental health apps including privacy issues and the high fees charged for premium features. Based on our findings, we discuss design implications for future work in the field of creating interactive mHealth apps.

 Educational technologies offer benefits in the classroom but there are barriers to their successful integration, including teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and their skills and experience. Participatory Design (PD) approaches offer one way in which teachers can be directly involved in the design of classroom technologies, however PD processes alone fail to address the challenges of integrating technology within existing practices. In this paper we propose co-teaching as a novel form of co-design practice. We describe a two year longitudinal Co-Teaching project resulting in the development and use of three digital designs for the classroom. Using the TPACK model to guide our reflections we offer insights into the ways that co-teaching can support the design and integration of educational technologies. We suggest that co-teaching as a form of co-design practice offers a way to move teachers from passive adopters of technology to active participants in the design and integration of educational technologies.

Assessing the Spatial Distribution of Visual Attention in a Virtual Environment: Development and Validation of a Novel VR-based Attentional Visual Field (AVF) Task,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519698,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/l3pwrogbzrdnzbfnw3mqa73lve/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519698,"
Visual attention is critical for everyday task performance and safety. The Attentional Visual Field Task (AVF) is an established, computerized method for assessing the distribution of visual attention across a wide visual field. High-fidelity virtual reality (VR) presents an opportunity for more ecological methods for assessing and training visual attention; however, this novel approach has not been examined. We developed a new VR-based AVF task, AVF-VE, using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) VR device with an integrated eye-tracker, and conducted a study to validate this newly developed visual attention task. We further examined how visual attention is distributed in a virtual visual field. The findings suggest that the VR-based visual attention task is a valid and useful tool that can be used for future attention research and training. Unique characteristics of the spatial distribution of visual attention in the virtual environment observed in the current evaluation study are discussed.

Sleep is a vital health issue. Continued sleep deficiency can increase the chance of stroke, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Previous studies have investigated sleep as an individual activity performed within bedrooms at night. In this study with twenty parents of young children, we identify sleep as a complex experience entangled with social dynamics between family members. For example, children's sleep means not just time for children to rest, but time for self-care for parents. This paper's contributions are twofold. First, we show how the boundaries that define sleep in terms of time (at night), space (in bedrooms), and unit of analysis (individual-focused) limit designers' opportunities to tackle the deeper sleep issues of families. Second, we suggest ""division of labor"" as an important but rarely discussed design concept to enhance family sleep, and as a design theme for home technologies that address issues emerging from social dynamics between householders.

 The role of HCI in informal caregivers’ lives has been a focus of research for some time. Yet to gain significance in HCI, are the implications of healthcare systems’ transformation into a personalised care paradigm, where citizens gain choice and control over the delivery of their care. We provide a first HCI paper to examine self-directed care budgets for disabled citizens, where care funding is controlled by the individual. We explore how digital technology can assist citizens, promoting peer support to create meaningful, personalised healthcare infrastructures. This qualitative study contributes insights from interviews and focus groups with 24 disabled citizens, informal caregivers and healthcare officers, to provide understanding of their experiences and practices. These insights highlight relational care, invisible labour, power struggles with authorities and how citizens seek socio-technical capability. We contribute design implications for self-directed care budgets and HCI research concerned with developing technologies that support this population.

Impact of Out-of-Vocabulary Words on the Twitter Experience of Blind Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501958,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/eywgtwm5jzckxejazbllspjh7y/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501958,"
 Most people who are blind interact with social media content with the assistance of a screen reader, a software that converts text to speech. However, the language used in social media is well-known to contain several informal out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., abbreviations, wordplays, slang), many of which do not have corresponding standard pronunciations. The narration behavior of screen readers for such out-of-vocabulary words and the corresponding impact on the social media experience of blind screen reader users are still uncharted research territories. Therefore we seek to plug this knowledge gap by examining how current popular screen readers narrate different types of out-of-vocabulary words found on Twitter, and also, how the presence of such words in tweets influences the interaction behavior and comprehension of blind screen reader users. Our investigation showed that screen readers rarely autocorrect out-of-vocabulary words, and moreover they do not always exhibit ideal behavior for certain prolific types of out-of-vocabulary words such as acronyms and initialisms. We also observed that blind users often rely on tedious and taxing workarounds to comprehend actual meanings of out-of-vocabulary words. Informed by the observations, we finally discuss methods that can potentially reduce this interaction burden for blind users on social media.

A study of the effects of network latency on visual task performance in video conferencing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519678,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/mfylx2377zh5td36ht2ys3cr6e/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519678,"
 We study the effects of network latency and jitter on visual task performance between participants in video conferencing. Users of video conferencing tools commonly report a phenomenon known as Zoom fatigue. We postulate that this is a consequence of the effort required to maintain visual communication in the face of network latency and jitter. Understanding the relationship between network latency, jitter, and Zoom fatigue can inform the design of visual computing methods to mitigate the effects. To study the causes of Zoom fatigue, we analyzed a visual communication task via video conferencing through a user study employing a game of Charades since it relies on highly visual communication. Our findings demonstrate a direct correlation between user performance while playing the game and network latency and that the level of user engagement in the game plays a vital role in indicating adaptation to the latency when user engagement levels are high.

“Sounds like a Cheesy Radio Ad”: Using User Perspectives for Enhancing Digital COVID Vaccine Communication Strategies for Public Health Agencies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519760,1,https://files.sigchi.org/conference/attachment/10072/content/73232/poster/0fe2cfe7-5d0c-1232-125d-9393aa905fec.pdf,"
 The World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies have identified vaccine hesitancy as a critical challenge in reducing future cases and deaths from COVID-19. The current study has investigated ways to improve a widely circulated vaccine infographic video by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After gathering qualitative feedback on properties of the message that could be improved (from online crowdworkers), we conducted a randomized experiment to investigate different combinations of these attributes. Our results suggest participants were more likely to share the video which was: (1) played more slowly; (2) had a female speaker; (3) did not have background music. The study demonstrates potential of user studies for improving existing communication strategies for encouraging vaccinations and alleviating vaccine hesitancy on social media platforms. Our contribution also includes a repository of messages to encourage vaccination, generated by online crowdworkers, which could be utilized by future studies.

Exploring Hybrid: A (hybrid) SIG to discuss hybrid conferences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516405,1,https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/25019/3491101.3516405.pdf?sequence=1,"
 In this special interest group (SIG), we follow up on previous conversations around hybrid models for conferences, conducted in open sessions by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) Executive Committee (EC). The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden shift to virtual conferences; as we start to go back to in-person events, it is important to reflect on the types of events we desire, and design these accordingly. With this SIG, we hope to share experiences from previous conferences (successful or not) and discuss potential solutions to pending issues. This SIG will be led by VP at Large Adriana S. Vivacqua, with the participation of other EC members.

FAR: End-to-End Vibrotactile Distributed System Designed to Facilitate Affect Regulation in Children Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Slow …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517619,2,,"
 To address difficulties with affect dysregulation in youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we designed and developed an end-to-end vibrotactile breathing pacer system and evaluated its usability. In this paper we describe the system architecture and the features we deployed for this system based on expert advice and reviews. Through piloting this system with one child diagnosed with ASD, we learned that our system was used in ways we did and did not anticipate. For example, the paced-breathing personalization procedure did not meet the attention span of the pilot participant but two instead of one pacer devices encouraged caregiver’s involvement. This paper details our learnings and concludes with a list of system design guidelines at the system architecture level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully functional vibrotactile system designed for ASD children that withstood usability testing in vitro for two weeks.

CoBlok: Collaborative performance in virtual reality and face-to-face,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519883,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/ku6ous7pajcjvhoclh5n7cjdii/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519883,"
Computer-mediated communication is being adopted in work and personal life around the world. Measuring collaborative performance would be useful for evaluating and optimizing social computing applications, but there is a lack of methods for it. For this purpose, we have developed a collaborative block design task, which requires collaboration and depends on simple and abstract rules. The task is about constructing three-dimensional structures out of primitive shapes based on cards representing two-dimensional flat projections of the complete structure. The task is presented as a physical version, which can be manufactured using a 3D printer and a laser cutter, as well as a virtual version which is released as an open source VRChat world created in Unity, and as task components which can be imported into any virtual 3D environment. The task can be used for evaluating systems and augmentations for their fitness for collaboration, as well as to investigate other phenomena which seem to be linked with better cooperation, such as inter-individual and inter-brain synchronization.

Users Can Deduce Sensitive Locations Protected by Privacy Zones on Fitness Tracking Apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502136,3,https://adambates.org/documents/Mink_Chi22.pdf,"
 Fitness tracking applications allow athletes to record and share their exercises online, including GPS routes of their activities. However, sharing mobility data potentially raises real-world privacy and safety risks. One strategy to mitigate that risk is a “Privacy Zone,” which conceals portions of the exercise routes that fall within a certain radius of a user-designated sensitive location. A pressing concern is whether privacy zones are an effective deterrent against common attackers, such as a bike thief that carefully scrutinizes online exercise activities in search of their next target. Further, little is known about user perceptions of privacy zones or how they fit into the broader landscape of available privacy precautions.  This work presents an online user study (N=603) that investigates the privacy concerns of fitness tracking users and evaluates the efficacy of privacy zones. Participants were first asked about their privacy behaviors with respect to fitness tracking applications. Next, participants completed an interactive task in which they attempted to deduce hidden locations protected by a privacy zone; we manipulated the number of displayed exercise activities that interacted with the privacy zone, as well as its size. Finally, participants were asked further questions about their impressions of privacy zones and use of other privacy precautions. We found that participants successfully inferred protected locations; for the most common privacy zone size, 68% of guesses fell within 50 meters of the hidden location when participants were shown just 3 activities. Further, we found that participants who viewed 3 activities were more confident about their success in the task compared to participants who viewed 1 activity. Combined, these results indicate that users’ privacy-sensitive locations are at risk even when using a privacy zone. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings on related privacy features and discuss recommendations to fitness tracking users and services to improve the privacy and safety of fitness trackers.

Can User Reviews Indicate Usability Heuristic Issues?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519659,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose-Cezar-De-Souza-Filho/publication/360268051_Can_User_Reviews_Indicate_Usability_Heuristic_Issues/links/626ca2bd0df856128f88f59a/Can-User-Reviews-Indicate-Usability-Heuristic-Issues.pdf,"
 User reviews of mobile applications in online stores have been used as a source for numerous studies. Many focus on indicating new functional requirements and extracting problems regarding quality characteristics, such as Usability. One of the most known strategies to evaluate Usability is Nielsen’s heuristics. We believe that user reviews in online stores can indicate heuristics issues, thus supporting evaluations more focused on the user feedback. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the presence of usability heuristic issues through user reviews. To achieve this goal, we collected and analyzed 200 reviews, split into 528 statements, from 10 free and paid Android and iOS apps. Our results showed that user reviews have certain potential to indicate heuristic issues, suggesting new and challenging future research for the CHI community.

Data Every Day: Designing and Living with Personal Situated Visualizations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517737,2,,"
 We explore the design and utility of situated manual self-tracking visualizations on dedicated displays that integrate data tracking into existing practices and physical environments. Situating self-tracking tools in relevant locations is a promising approach to enable reflection on and awareness of data without needing to rely on sensorized tracking or personal devices. In both a long-term autobiographical design process and a co-design study with six participants, we rapidly prototyped and deployed 30 situated self-tracking applications over a ten month period. Grounded in the experience of designing and living with these trackers, we contribute findings on logging and data entry, the use of situated displays, and the visual design and customization of trackers. Our results demonstrate the potential of customizable dedicated self-tracking visualizations that are situated in relevant physical spaces, and suggest future research opportunities and new potential applications for situated visualizations.

New technologies and digitization have the potential to vastly alter our knowledge infrastructures. Specifically, this work focuses on the effects of interactive technologies on research practices, referred as “interactive research artifacts.” Current research investigates the communicative affordances of such technologies, but there exists minimal work which critically examines the creative ways scholars are engaging with these artifacts. Through in-depth interviews with 14 scholars, and Design Studies literature, this work arrives at an understanding of interactive research artifacts as creative knowledge creation tools, rather than simply communicative tools. As such, to design for a future where interactive research artifacts become commonly used scholarly tools, an in-depth understanding of the ways these artifacts are used as knowledge creation tools is critical.

What's the appeal? Perceptions of review processes for algorithmic decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517606,6,https://www.senuriwijenayake.com/papers/2022/CHI.pdf,"
 If you were significantly impacted by an algorithmic decision, how would you want the decision to be reviewed? In this study, we explore perceptions of review processes for algorithmic decisions that differ across three dimensions: the reviewer, how the review is conducted, and how long the review takes. Using a choice-based conjoint analysis we find that people prefer review processes that provide for human review, the ability to participate in the review process, and a timely outcome. Using a survey, we find that people also see human review that provides for participation to be the fairest review process. Our qualitative analysis indicates that the fairest review process provides the greatest likelihood of a favourable outcome, an opportunity for the decision subject and their situation to be fully and accurately understood, human involvement, and dignity. These findings have implications for the design of contestation procedures and also the design of algorithmic decision-making processes.

MindYoga: Scaffolding the Metacognitive Reflection Process within Learning Ecosystems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519751,1,https://leesha.io/docs/mindyoga_chi22extendedabstracts-337.pdf,"
To learn how to self-direct research, students must learn to reflect and improve upon a diverse set of metacognitive skills. Models like Agile Research Studios (ARS) provide ecosystems of tools and processes designed to help students hone their reflection skills as they practice research. However, students still struggle to enact their reflection processes across the supports available to them, as mentors coach them to do. MindYoga integrates a process framework that helps students monitor and enact their metacognitive reflection process across an ARS ecosystem. Findings show students using MindYoga were (1) able to monitor which metacognitive risks may affect their upcoming project work, (2) able to develop action plans based on mentor feedback to address these risks, and (3) actively reminded of their action items during relevant practice sessions. Moving forward, process frameworks like MindYoga can help learners develop and improve their work processes as they practice within learning ecosystems.

Mixplorer: Scaffolding Design Space Exploration through Genetic Recombination of Multiple Peoples' Designs to Support Novices' Creativity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501854,4,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/539414/1/chi22-37.pdf,"
 The ability to consider a wide range of solutions to a design problem is a crucial skill for designers, and is a major differentiator between experts and novices. One reason for this is that novices are unaware of the full extent of the design space in which solutions are situated. To support novice designers with design space exploration, we introduce Mixplorer, a system that allows designers to take an initial design and mix it with other designs. Mixplorer differs from existing tools by supporting the exploration of ill-defined design spaces through social design space exploration. To evaluate Mixplorer, we conducted (1) an interview study with design instructors who reported that Mixplorer would “help to open the minds” of novice designers and (2) a controlled experiment with novices, finding that the design-mixing functionality of Mixplorer provided significantly better support for creativity, and that participants who mixed designs produced more novel designs.

Excitement Projector: Augmenting Excitement-Perception and Arousal through Bio-signal-based Haptic Feedback in Remote-Sport Watching,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519619,1,,"
 For non-sport fans, perceiving the excitement of surrounding fan groups and the arousal of collective emotions are some of the crucial factors that motivate their engaged excitement and loyalty in a sport; these factors are closely related to the process of evolution from a non-fan to a fan. The global COVID-19 pandemic changed the way of sport-watching from watching at the arena to watching from home alone. This has highlighted significant difficulties in the excitement transmission and arousal channel between non-sport fans and fans. Previous remote emotional intervening mediums had been limited to the use of virtual avatars to convey partners’ external cues (such as appearance), to enhance the sense of presence from visual-audio perspectives. In this study, we explored a novel remote emotional intervening medium that conveys sport-fans’ internal cues (bio-signals) that are widely believed to be related to internal emotional states of human, and displays those signals in a way that gives non-sport fans a deeper and more immersive experience: haptic feedback experience. Three bio-signal-based haptic feedback prototypes were developed, including heart-rate-based vibration, electromyography (EMG)-based pressure, and skin-temperature-based thermal feedbacks. An exploratory pilot study was conducted on a group of non-sport fans in a lab-control environment of remote-sport-watching to explore the effectiveness of the proposed mediums in enhancing their perception of sport-fan’s excitement (emotion perception). Besides, we also analyzed non-sport fans’ heart rate data when they were participants in the experiments to measure the performance of the proposed mediums in evoking the engaged excitement of non-sport fans (emotion arousal). Our results indicate the outstanding ability of EMG-based pressure feedback in effectively enhancing the process of emotion perception and the notable advantage of heart-rate-based vibration feedback in the arousal of non-sport fans’ engaged excitement. This study presents the potential utility of bio-signal-based haptic feedback in augmenting remote emotional perception and arousal and also provides the underlining support for the future exploration and development directions for social computing based on bio-signals and haptic technologies.

” I happen to be one of 47.8%”: Social-Emotional and Data Reasoning in Middle School Students' Comics about Friendship,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502086,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502086,"
 Effective data literacy instruction requires that learners move beyond understanding statistics to being able to humanize data through a contextual understanding of argumentation and reasoning in the real-world. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a co-designed data comic unit about adolescent friendships. The 7th grade unit involved students analyzing data graphs about adolescent friendships and crafting comic narratives to convey perspectives on that data. Findings from our analysis of 33 student comics, and interviews with two teachers and four students, show that students engaged in various forms of data reasoning and social-emotional reasoning. These findings contribute an understanding of how students make sense of data about personal, everyday experiences; and how an arts-integrated curriculum can be designed to support their mutual engagement in both data and social-emotional reasoning.

 Although the interaction capability of soft sensors has been explored in the field of HCI, they are found to have limitations in shape, wiring management, and softness due to the characteristics of the material. In this paper, we propose a design of 3D-printed resistive soft sensors that can detect deformation by creating internal lattice structures with flexible conductive materials. The magnitude of deformation can be detected by measuring the resistance between a pair of electrodes. By adjusting the parameters of the lattice structure, a soft sensor with high flexibility of shape design and adjustable local softness can be realized. In addition, by inserting non-conductive structures into the sensor structure, external wires can be consolidated in one place. We present a design and fabrication pipeline, and investigate the fundamental characteristics of several patterns of sensors. We also show several applications that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Low-effort user authentication for kiosk systems based on smartphone user's gripping hand geometry,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519817,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/m3o322caoraglf6pyywr46ccya/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519817,"
 Smartphones continue to proliferate throughout our daily lives, not only in sheer quantity but also in their ever-growing list of uses. In addition to communication and entertainment, smartphones can also be used as a credit card to make a contactless payment on Kiosk Systems, such as ordering food, printing tickets and self-checkout. When a user holds the phone close to the Kiosk system to present payment credentials, we propose to also verify the user’s identity based on a photo of the back of their smartphone gripping hand, which provides a second security layer. Compared to the widely used facial recognition, the proposed approach addresses the recent struggles of identifying faces under masks and the public concerns of potential privacy erosion, racial bias and misuse. We find that the geometry of each individual’s hand, when it grips a phone, is identifiable and then design a vision-based approach to extract the gripping hand biometrics. In particular, we develop hand image processing schemes to detect and localize the gripping hand while denoising and normalizing the hand images (e.g., size and color). Furthermore, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm to distinguish smartphone users’ gripping hand images for authentication. Experiments with 20 participants show that the system achieves 99.5% accuracy for user verification.

Electronic health records in critical care medicine offer unprecedented opportunities for clinical reasoning and decision making. Paradoxically, these data-rich environments have also resulted in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that fit poorly into clinical contexts, and increase health workers cognitive load. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to designing CDSSs that are embedded in clinical workflows, by presenting problem-based curated data views tailored for problem-driven discovery, team communication, and situational awareness. We describe the design and evaluation of one such CDSS, In-Sight, that embodies our approach and addresses the clinical problem of monitoring critically ill pediatric patients. Our work is the result of a co-design process, further informed by empirical data collected through formal usability testing, focus groups, and a simulation study with domain experts. We discuss the potential and limitations of our approach, and share lessons learned in our iterative co-design process.

Here we present a co-design exploration into the potential of technology to playfully re-signify urban spaces. We created a speculative catalog of urban tech and used it to facilitate multi-stakeholder discussions about the playful potential of smart cities. The learnings from our co-design engagements embody different people's ideas of how tech might and might not support rich forms of urban play, and contribute to ongoing efforts at exploring how to playfully reconfigure our cities. We present: (1) a list of inspirational play potentials of urban spaces—i.e. playful things already people do, and enjoy, in the public space; (2) a portfolio of speculative ideas that show how tech might help to realize that potential; and (3) a discussion of stakeholders’ responses to these ideas. Our work can provide designers with inspiration and actionable advice for cultivating forms of urban play that cater to people's socio-emotional needs.

Affinder: Expressing Concepts of Situations that Afford Activities using Context-Detectors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501902,2,http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/papers/affinder.pdf,"
Context-aware applications have the potential to act opportunistically to facilitate human experiences and activities, from reminding us of places to perform personal activities, to identifying coincidental moments to engage in digitally-mediated shared experiences. However, despite the availability of context-detectors and programming frameworks for defining how such applications should trigger, designers lack support for expressing their human concepts of a situation and the experiences and activities they afford (e.g., situations to toss a frisbee) when context-features are made available at the level of locations (e.g., parks). This paper introduces Affinder, a block-based programming environment that supports constructing concept expressions that effectively translate their conceptions of a situation into a machine representation using available context features. During pilot testing, we discovered three bridging challenges that arise when expressing situations that cannot be encoded directly by a single context-feature. To overcome these bridging challenges, Affinder provides designers (1) an unlimited vocabulary search for discovering features they may have forgotten; (2) prompts for reflecting and expanding their concepts of a situation and ideas for foraging for context-features; and (3) simulation and repair tools for identifying and resolving issues with the precision of concept expressions on real use-cases. In a comparison study, we found that Affinder’s core functions helped designers stretch their concepts of how to express a situation, find relevant context-features matching their concepts, and recognize when the concept expression operated differently than intended on real-world cases. These results show that Affinder and tools that support bridging can improve a designer’s ability to express their concepts of a human situation into detectable machine representations—thus pushing the boundaries of how computing systems support our activities in the world.

A Conversational Approach for Modifying Service Mashups in IoT Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517655,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517655,"
Existing conversational approaches for Internet of Things (IoT) service mashup do not support modification because of the usability challenge, although it is common for users to modify the service mashups in IoT environments. To support the modification of IoT service mashups through conversational interfaces in a usable manner, we propose the conversational mashup modification agent (CoMMA). Users can modify IoT service mashups using CoMMA through natural language conversations. CoMMA has a two-step mashup modification interaction, an implicature-based localization step, and a modification step with a disambiguation strategy. The localization step allows users to easily search for a mashup by vocalizing their expressions in the environment. The modification step supports users to modify mashups by speaking simple modification commands. We conducted a user study and the results show that CoMMA is as effective as visual approaches in terms of task completion time and perceived task workload for modifying IoT service mashups.

Lattice menu: A low-error gaze-based marking menu utilizing target-assisted gaze gestures on a lattice of visual anchors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501977,2,https://taejun13.github.io/paper/LatticeMenu_paper.pdf,"
We present Lattice Menu, a gaze-based marking menu utilizing a lattice of visual anchors that helps perform accurate gaze pointing for menu item selection. Users who know the location of the desired item can leverage target-assisted gaze gestures for multilevel item selection by looking at visual anchors over the gaze trajectories. Our evaluation showed that Lattice Menu exhibits a considerably low error rate (~1%) and a quick menu selection time (1.3-1.6 s) for expert usage across various menu structures (4 × 4 × 4 and 6 × 6 × 6) and sizes (8, 10 and 12°). In comparison with a traditional gaze-based marking menu that does not utilize visual targets, Lattice Menu showed remarkably (~5 times) fewer menu selection errors for expert usage. In a post-interview, all 12 subjects preferred Lattice Menu, and most subjects (8 out of 12) commented that the provisioning of visual targets facilitated more stable menu selections with reduced eye fatigue.

 Gaze and speech are rich contextual sources of information that, when combined, can result in effective and rich multimodal interactions. This paper proposes a machine learning-based pipeline that leverages and combines users’ natural gaze activity, the semantic knowledge from their vocal utterances and the synchronicity between gaze and speech data to facilitate users’ interaction. We evaluated our proposed approach on an existing dataset, which involved 32 participants recording voice notes while reading an academic paper. Using a Logistic Regression classifier, we demonstrate that our proposed multimodal approach maps voice notes with accurate text passages with an average F1-Score of 0.90. Our proposed pipeline motivates the design of multimodal interfaces that combines natural gaze and speech patterns to enable robust interactions.

Through collaborative playlists (CPs), streaming platform users have co-curated music together for various purposes for over a decade. As the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how people come together through technology and engage with music, CPs have also taken on new roles and value. To understand how CP usage and perception have evolved since the onset of COVID-19, we conducted a mixed-methods investigation of CPs in the United States. Survey results from primarily CP users (N=142) revealed that interest in and usage of CPs have mostly increased since the pandemic, and that the role of music in connecting with others is positively correlated with the perceived impact of COVID-19. Follow-up interviews (N=9) provided additional insights into changing perceptions and usage patterns of CPs during COVID-19; for instance, fewer collaborators per playlist reflects users’ greater focus on strengthening social connections and relationships. Taken together, findings and design implications on digitally mediated co-curation further elucidate the necessity for social and collaborative experiences with music supported by CPs during COVID-19.

Who Owns the Future of Work?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516386,1,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s43057-022-00085-4.pdf,"
 This submission is intended to start a critical conversation about the ”Future of Work.” I expose the ideological commitments of major funders of research into this area, such as the NSF and private think tanks, because they shape narratives on work and worker organizing as well as the course of technology development more broadly. In the research itself, workers may be invited to participate in computing research, but they seldom determine the goals of projects nor do they own the results. Ultimately, while government agencies and nonprofit organizations claim to seek improved conditions for workers, the knowledge and technologies produced through this research serve primarily to undermine the power of working class people and their unions.

Climate Resiliency Through Data: Managing Stormwater Sewers in Detroit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516804,1,https://files.sigchi.org/conference/attachment/10072/content/70547/poster/77c58368-7509-3052-c2ca-3fe4693b0c68.pdf,"
 Climate change is intensifying weather around the world. In cities like Detroit, USA, larger storms are resulting in widespread flooding and sewer overflows. To adapt to the changing climate, Detroit is modernizing its sewer infrastructure, adding sensors, robotics, and advanced algorithms that have the potential to increase the capacity and adaptability of its sewer system. The water utility is struggling, however, to incorporate these new technologies into its existing user workflows. We have conducted a user study of water operators in Detroit focused on understanding how they currently visualize and use one of their most critical data sources — weather data. Based on our findings, we have developed a new weather dashboard that minimizes weather data uncertainty by synthesizing multiple sources. This research aims to inform the design of new data interfaces for water operators, and learn best practices for incorporating uncertain data in data-driven decision-making processes.

The future is red: Visualizing wildfire predictions using contactless interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519903,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/c2tkdcph4ndc3nx7wrebomi764/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519903,"
This paper presents our approach for visualizing, sonifying, and predicting wildfire in the near future and contactless interaction. We provide an interaction tool to depict the causes and results of the wildfire and promote awareness of the environmental issues by giving forecasting results of the wildfire to the audience. Multimodal interaction allows the audience to dynamically experience the changes of the wildfire over time in two representative locations. (California, United States, and South Korea) The interactive multimodal data visualization and sonification depict the past, present, and future of the wildfire. This data-driven design was installed in an art gallery and presented to audience members. Contactless user interaction with Leap Motion cameras was used during the pandemic period for hygienic interaction. In this paper, we describe the design process and how this interface was developed based on environmental issues, and informal user responses from the art gallery setup are discussed.

Can't Touch This: Rethinking Public Technology in a COVID-19 Era,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501980,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501980,"
 What do pedestrian crossings, ATMs, elevators and ticket machines have in common? These are just a few of the ubiquitous yet essential elements of public-space infrastructure that rely on physical buttons or touchscreens; common interactions that, until recently, were considered perfectly safe to perform. This work investigates how we might integrate touchless technologies into public-space infrastructure in order to minimise physical interaction with shared devices in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on an ethnographic exploration into how public utilities are being used, adapted or avoided, we developed and evaluated a suite of technology probes that can be either retrofitted into, or replace, these services. In-situ community deployments of our probes demonstrate strong uptake and provide insight into how hands-free technologies can be adapted and utilised for the public domain; and, in turn, used to inform the future of walk-up-and use public technologies.

“I Don't Want To Shoot The Android”: Players Translate Real-Life Moral Intuitions to In-Game Decisions in Detroit: Become Human,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502019,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502019,"
 In interactive story games, players make decisions that advance and modify the unfolding story. In many cases, these decisions have a moral component. Examining decision-making in these games illuminates whether players mobilize their real-life morality to make in-game decisions and what impact this has in both the game world and real life. Using mixed-methods consisting of semi-structured interviews and the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ30), we collected data from 19 participants who played the game Detroit: Become Human. We analyzed how participants applied their real-life morals toward in-game decisions using thematic analysis and statistical analysis of the MFQ30 results. Qualitative findings indicate that participants mobilize their moral intuitions to make in-game decisions and how much participants cared about their game characters influenced their choices. We contribute a better understanding of how players react to moral dilemmas in interactive story games for game designers to help them improve player experience.

Permission vs. app limiters: Profiling smartphone users to understand differing strategies for mobile privacy management,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517652,2,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10374188,"
 We conducted a user study with 380 Android users, profiling them according to two key privacy behaviors: the number of apps installed and the Dangerous permissions granted to those apps. We identified four unique privacy profiles: 1) Privacy Balancers (49.74% of participants), 2) Permission Limiters (28.68%), 3) App Limiters (14.74%), and 4) the Privacy Unconcerned (6.84%). App and Permission Limiters were significantly more concerned about perceived surveillance than Privacy Balancers and the Privacy Unconcerned. App Limiters had the lowest number of apps installed on their devices with the lowest intention of using apps and sharing information with them, compared to Permission Limiters who had the highest number of apps installed and reported higher intention to share information with apps. The four profiles reflect the differing privacy management strategies, perceptions, and intentions of Android users that go beyond the binary decision to share or withhold information via mobile apps.

Who Will Support My Project? Interactive Search of Potential Crowdfunding Investors Through inSearch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519725,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02041,"
Crowdfunding provides project founders with a convenient way to reach online investors. However, it is challenging for founders to find the most potential investors and successfully raise money for their projects on crowdfunding platforms. A few machine learning based methods have been proposed to recommend investors’ interest in a specific crowdfunding project, but they fail to provide project founders with explanations in detail for these recommendations, thereby leading to an erosion of trust in predicted investors. To help crowdfunding founders find truly interested investors, we conducted semi-structured interviews with four crowdfunding experts and presents inSearch, a visual analytic system. inSearch allows founders to search for investors interactively on crowdfunding platforms. It supports an effective overview of potential investors by leveraging a Graph Neural Network to model investor preferences. Besides, it enables interactive exploration and comparison of the temporal evolution of different investors’ investment details.

Supporting Real-time Peer-Mentoring of Rural Volunteers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517598,2,https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/49042/1/chi22b_sub3521_cam_i16.pdf,"
 Telephone-driven community forums have been a widely proposed solution to address the unreliable internet connectivity and large geographic scope that characterizes many international NGO contexts. Primarily, these applications support asynchronous activities, such as information portals or forums to access rural journalism, but opportunities for real-time experience sharing remain largely under-explored. In this paper, we explore the potential of such forums to support remote mentoring of NGO volunteers, a practice that requires synchronous, dialogical formats for experience sharing and peer discussion. We engaged 28 participants from a rural Indian NGO in the design of peer-mentoring sessions that leverage synchronous audio discussions, using the structure and format of traditional talk-show radio as a starting point. The participants favored an entertaining approach to mentoring and discussed the logistics required to achieve this within their resource constraints. We conclude with design implications for designing media-driven community engagement platforms and the ethical challenges around protecting marginalized community interests.

Embodied Geometric Reasoning with a Robot: The Impact of Robot Gestures on Student Reasoning about Geometrical Conjectures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517556,2,,"
 In this paper, we explore how the physically embodied nature of robots can influence learning through non-verbal communication, such as gesturing. We take an embodied cognition perspective to examine student interactions with a NAO robot that uses gestures while reasoning about geometry conjectures. College aged students (N = 30) were randomly assigned to either a dynamic condition, where the robot uses dynamic gestures that represent and manipulate geometric shapes in the conjectures, or control condition, where the robot uses beat gestures that match the rhythm of speech. Students in the dynamic condition: (1) use more gestures when they reason about geometry conjectures, (2) look more at the robot as it speaks, (3) feel the robot is a better study partner and uses effective gestures, but (4) were not more successful in correctly reasoning about geometry conjectures. We discuss implications for socially supported and embodied learning with a physically present robot.

Re-imagining the Power of Priming and Framing Effects in the Context of Political Crowdfunding Campaigns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502084,2,https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/get/a/publication/1160.pdf,"
 In recent years, political crowdfunding campaigns have emerged through which politicians raise money to fund their election campaigns. Divisive issues discussed in these campaigns may not only motivate donations but also could have a broader priming effect on people’s social opinions. In the U.S., more than one-third of the population with moderate opinions show a tendency to swing their opinion based on recent and more accessible events. In this paper, we ask: can such campaigns further prime people’s responses to partisan topics, even when we discuss those topics in a non-political context? To answer this question, we analyzed the influence of exposure to a political candidate’s crowdfunding campaign on responses to a subsequently seen, unrelated scientific topic that is not inherently political but is seen as partisan in the U.S. (climate change). We found that exposure to an attitude-inconsistent political candidate’s crowdfunding campaign (a campaign that is counter to someone’s existing political beliefs) can have a significant priming effect on subsequently seen politically charged topics. This effect may occur due to the activation of in-group identity by the candidate’s partisan campaign. Guided by these findings, we investigated elements that can mitigate this self-categorization effect. We found that carefully designed content following framing techniques such as schema framing and threat/safety framing can mitigate people’s sense of self-categorization toward non-political topics.

Algosolve: Supporting subgoal learning in algorithmic problem-solving with learnersourced microtasks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501917,2,https://kixlab.github.io/website-files/2022/chi2022-AlgoSolve-paper.pdf,"
 Designing solution plans before writing code is critical for successful algorithmic problem-solving. Novices, however, often plan on-the-fly during implementation, resulting in unsuccessful problem-solving due to lack of mental organization of the solution. Research shows that subgoal learning helps learners develop more complete solution plans by enhancing their understanding of the high-level solution structure. However, expert-created materials such as subgoal labels are necessary to provide learning benefits from subgoal learning, which are a scarce resource in self-learning due to limited availability and high cost. We propose a learnersourcing workflow that collects high-quality subgoal labels from learners by helping them improve their label quality. We implemented the workflow into AlgoSolve, a prototype interface that supports subgoal learning for algorithmic problems. A between-subjects study with 63 problem-solving novices revealed that AlgoSolve helped learners create higher-quality labels and more complete solution plans, compared to a baseline method known to be effective in subgoal learning.

Understanding Screen-based Dining Practices through the Lens of Mindful Eating,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517651,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/oibrscedw5adbdb6cdhwizuble/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517651,"
Our eating practices are increasingly overshadowed by the presence of screen-based media technologies that conflict with the ideologies of mindful eating. However, little is known about whether and how screens influence our eating behaviors. To contribute to this understanding, we present a rich account of dining practices of ten participants with and without screen. Our study revealed that eating with screens was found more enjoyable than eating alone. Screens can influence one's awareness of hunger and other behaviors like chewing rate and food gaze, whereas screen-media did not trigger any judgements for food. Drawing on the study insights, we highlight the role of technology to support bodily awareness, savoring, a non-judgmental attitude to eating and on rethinking distractions as companions. The outlined considerations encourage a creative yet careful take on making mindful eating more accessible within the realities of screen-based dining cultures.

A Personalized Visual Aid for Selections of Appearance Building Products with Long-term Effects,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517659,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/c4lwczlib5ecllrdccmlel456q/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517659,"
It is challenging for customers to select appearance building products (e.g., skincare products, weight loss programs) that suit them personally as such products usually demonstrate efficacy only after long-term usage. Although e-retailers generally provide product descriptions or other customers’ reviews, users often find it hard to relate to their own situations. In this work, we proposed a pipeline to display envisioned users’ appearance after long-term use of appearance building products to deliver their efficacy on each individual visually. We selected skincare as a case and developed SkincareMirror which predicts skincare effects on users’ facial images by analyzing product function labels, efficacy ratings, and skin models’ images. The results of a between-subjects study (N=48) show that (1) SkincareMirror outperforms the baseline shopping site in terms of perceived usability, usefulness, user satisfaction and helps users select products faster; (2) SkincareMirror is especially effective to males and users with limited product domain knowledge.

 Understanding decision-making in dynamic and complex settings is a challenge yet essential for preventing, mitigating, and responding to adverse events (e.g., disasters, financial crises). Simulation games have shown promise to advance our understanding of decision-making in such settings. However, an open question remains on how we extract useful information from these games. We contribute an approach to model human-simulation interaction by leveraging existing methods to characterize: (1) system states of dynamic simulation environments (with Principal Component Analysis), (2) behavioral responses from human interaction with simulation (with Hidden Markov Models), and (3) behavioral responses across system states (with Sequence Analysis). We demonstrate this approach with our game simulating drug shortages in a supply chain context. Results from our experimental study with 135 participants show different player types (hoarders, reactors, followers), how behavior changes in different system states, and how sharing information impacts behavior. We discuss how our findings challenge existing literature.

VolunteerSpot: Helping connect organizations in need of help with those seeking to give.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3514486,1,,"
Gratitude, according to Oxford Language, is “the quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness.” One way to express gratitude is through community service, however, we found that high school and college students find it difficult to access service opportunities, especially when busy with school and other extracurricular activities. After completing eight in-depth interviews, we found students had difficulty in finding opportunities that sparked their interest, contacting organizations, as well as keeping track of their hours for organizations such as service clubs or college Greek life. To solve these problems for students, we created VolunteerSpot: an app that allows high school and college students to easily find service opportunities at the tip of their finger. VolunteerSpot utilizes an interface for volunteers, where they can filter through service opportunities by category, and an interface for organizations, who can post job opportunities. The app employs a messaging feature for communication between groups, a review widget, and can filter service opportunities by category and proximity to the user. We hope that by creating VolunteerSpot, students can use our app to give back to their community and express gratitude in an easy and interactive way.

Scalar: Authoring semantically adaptive augmented reality experiences in virtual reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517665,19,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517665,"
Augmented Reality (AR) experiences tightly associate virtual contents with environmental entities. However, the dissimilarity of different environments limits the adaptive AR content behaviors under large-scale deployment. We propose ScalAR, an integrated workflow enabling designers to author semantically adaptive AR experiences in Virtual Reality (VR). First, potential AR consumers collect local scenes with a semantic understanding technique. ScalAR then synthesizes numerous similar scenes. In VR, a designer authors the AR contents’ semantic associations and validates the design while being immersed in the provided scenes. We adopt a decision-tree-based algorithm to fit the designer’s demonstrations as a semantic adaptation model to deploy the authored AR experience in a physical scene. We further showcase two application scenarios authored by ScalAR and conduct a two-session user study where the quantitative results prove the accuracy of the AR content rendering and the qualitative results show the usability of ScalAR.

Machine-Mediated Teaming: Mixture of Human and Machine in Physical Gaming Experience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517555,2,,"
Technological advancement has opened up opportunities for new sports and physical activities. We introduce a concept called machine-mediated teaming, in which a human and a surrogate machine form a team to participate in physical sports games. To understand the experience of machine-mediated teaming and the guidelines for designing the system to achieve the concept, we built a case study system based on tug-of-war. Our system is a sports game played by two against two. One team consists of a player who actually pulls the rope and another player who participates in the physical game by controlling the machine’s actuators. We conducted user studies using this system to investigate the sport experience in this form and to reveal insights to inform future research on machine-mediated teaming. Based on the data obtained from the user studies, we clarified three perspectives, machine stamina, action space, and explicit feedback, that should be considered when designing future machine-mediated teaming systems. The research presented in this paper offers a first step towards exploring how humans and machines can coexist in highly dynamic physical interactions.

We investigate performance characteristics when switching between four pointing methods: absolute touch, absolute pen, relative mouse, and relative trackpad. The established “subtraction method” protocol used in mode-switching studies is extended to test pairs of methods and accommodate switch direction, multiple baselines, and controlling relative cursor position. A first experiment examines method switching on and around the horizontal surface of a tablet. Results find switching between pen and touch is fastest, and switching between relative and absolute methods incurs additional time penalty. A second experiment expands the investigation to an emerging foldable all-screen laptop form factor where switching also occurs on an angled surface and along a smoothly curved hinge. Results find switching between trackpad and touch is fastest, with all switching times generally higher. Our work contributes missing empirical evidence for switching performance using modern input methods, and our results can inform interaction design for current and emerging device form factors.

 We found significant gaps in the climates and built environments used as settings for studies of HCI outdoors. The experience of using a computer outdoors varies widely depending on location-specific factors such as weather and the availability of electricity. We surveyed 699 papers from CHI venues and found 101 studies involving a person and a computer interacting outdoors for which we could determine the study location. We categorized each study location by climate using the Köppen-Geiger scheme and by built environment using the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum. 91 of 101 studies took place in temperate or continental climates and 82 took place in urban settings. Emerging understanding of the ongoing impacts of climate change increases the importance of investigating HCI outdoors in a wider range of weather conditions. While some primitive natural settings have been preserved against development at great cost, we found no studies of HCI outdoors in those settings.

GRATIFOOD,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3514493,1,,"
We often take things for granted. One such thing is food. A lot of effort goes on in bringing the plate of food to our tables, and we recognize that effort when we cook for ourselves, but often we neglect that when we eat at restaurants. Invisible Workers (People working behind the scenes) ranging from farmers, people from production, distribution, storing, stocking, and many more to the chefs that cook our food are some of the people that have put a lot of effort into the food on our plates. The goal of this paper is to acknowledge and make the effort of invisible workers visible by raising awareness and offering a means to express gratitude. As a specific case, we decided to focus on workers at Indiana University Diners that represent a part of a huge population of invisible workers. Our design uses a Kiosk based system that will allow students who eat at Indiana university diner to share gratitude that will reach the invisible workers via diverse ways such as email, audio, etc.

 With increased public scrutiny of policing and growing calls for community-based violence prevention, street outreach programs that hire residents to mediate conflicts in their neighborhoods are gaining support. To understand how street outreach workers (SOWs) use information and communication technologies (ICTs) and how they envision future ICTs that better support their work, we interviewed 25 SOWs across three organizations. Results suggest that SOWs leverage ICTs to: 1) identify and mediate conflict; 2) support collaboration and teamwork; and 3) invoke community connections and trust. SOWs posit that new ICTs could provide a seamless infrastructure for communication among SOWs and between community members, assist with training to sharpen conflict negotiation skills, and provide insight on effective conflict mediation strategies.

'Are They Doing Better In The Clinic Or At Home?': Understanding Clinicians' Needs When Visualizing Wearable Sensor Data Used In Remote Gait Assessments For …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501989,3,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10332621,"
 Walking impairment is a debilitating symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disease affecting 2.8 million people worldwide. While clinicians’ in-person observational gait assessments are important, research suggests that data from wearable sensors can indicate early onset of gait impairment, track patients’ responses to treatment, and support remote and longitudinal assessment. We present an inquiry into supporting the transition from research to clinical practice. Co-design by HCI, biomedical, neurology and rehabilitation researchers resulted in a data-rich interface prototype for augmented gait analysis based on visualized sensor data. We used this as a prompt in interviews with ten experienced clinicians from a range of MS rehabilitation roles. We find that clinicians value quantitative sensor data within a whole patient narrative, to help track specific rehabilitation goals, but identify a tension between grasping critical information quickly and more detailed understanding. Based on the findings we make design recommendations for data-rich remote rehabilitation interfaces.

A layered authoring tool for stylized 3d animations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501894,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501894,"
Guided by the 12 principles of animation, stylization is a core 2D animation feature but has been utilized mainly by experienced animators. Although there are tools for stylizing 2D animations, creating stylized 3D animations remains a challenging problem due to the additional spatial dimension and the need for responsive actions like contact and collision. We propose a system that helps users create stylized casual 3D animations. A layered authoring interface is employed to balance between ease of use and expressiveness. Our surface level UI is a timeline sequencer that lets users add preset stylization effects such as squash and stretch and follow through to plain motions. Users can adjust spatial and temporal parameters to fine-tune these stylizations. These edits are propagated to our node-graph-based second level UI, in which the users can create custom stylizations after they are comfortable with the surface level UI. Our system also enables the stylization of interactions among multiple objects like force, energy, and collision. A pilot user study has shown that our fluid layered UI design allows for both ease of use and expressiveness better than existing tools.

Designing technology for emergency medical services (EMS) can be difficult, for example, due to limited access to domain experts. To support designers who aim to engage in a participatory design process in EMS environments, we created and evaluated the Contextual Secondary Video Toolkit (CSVT). This method uses secondary video material and design cards that allow domain experts to identify and prioritise challenges in their work environment and generate design ideas that address them. We illustrate the effects of the CSVT on design processes by analysing four workshops during which aeromedical EMS staff explored the potential of augmented reality to support their work. Our results indicate that the CSVT can support reflection about work practices, aid the generation of design ideas, and facilitate genuine participation. Furthermore, our data indicates that the use of secondary video in design projects is appropriate and even has certain advantages compared to primary field video.

It also inspired an unprecedented level of providing access to digital devices to communities and individuals lacking prior access. The situation and circumstances provide a unique opportunity to understand digital divides through a new lens. In this work, we contribute a contemporaneous understanding of digital divides beyond access by qualitatively analyzing over 300 calls made to a volunteer-based community IT help desk. We highlight the intertwined network of challenges leading to ecosystem digital divides and contribute new insights into how the complex socio-technical systems of practice, and the tools to support them, must adapt to bridge digital divides more effectively.

SonarID: Using Sonar to Identify Fingers on a Smartwatch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501935,2,http://www.whereveriam.org/work/UNIST/Kim-CHI22.pdf,"
The diminutive size of wrist wearables has prompted the design of many novel input techniques to increase expressivity. Finger identification, or assigning different functionality to different fingers, has been frequently proposed. However, while the value of the technique seems clear, its implementation remains challenging, often relying on external devices (e.g., worn magnets) or explicit instructions. Addressing these limitations, this paper explores a novel approach to natural and unencumbered finger identification on an unmodified smartwatch: sonar. To do this, we adapt an existing finger tracking smartphone sonar implementation—rather than extract finger motion, we process raw sonar fingerprints representing the complete sonar scene recorded during a touch. We capture data from 16 participants operating a smartwatch and use their sonar fingerprints to train a deep learning recognizer that identifies taps by the thumb, index, and middle fingers with an accuracy of up to 93.7%, sufficient to support meaningful application development.

Visualizing urban accessibility: Investigating multi-stakeholder perspectives through a map-based design probe study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517460,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517460,"
Urban accessibility assessments are challenging: they involve varied stakeholders across decision-making contexts while serving a diverse population of people with disabilities. To better support urban accessibility assessment using data visualizations, we conducted a three-part interview study with 25 participants across five stakeholder groups using map visualization probes. We present a multi-stakeholder analysis of visualization needs and sensemaking processes to explore how interactive visualizations can support stakeholder decision making. In particular, we elaborate how stakeholders’ varying levels of familiarity with accessibility, geospatial analysis, and specific geographic locations influences their sensemaking needs. We then contribute 10 design considerations for geovisual analytic tools for urban accessibility communication, planning, policymaking, and advocacy.

“It's A Drag”: Exploring How to Improve Parents' Experiences of Managing Mobile Device Use During Family Time,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517501,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/tmcv6dgtmnezbmhyubbzmktaiq/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517501,"
Research reveals that managing mobile device use during family time can be a source of stress for parents. In particular, it can create conflict in their relationships. As such, there is a need to understand how these problematic experiences might be addressed by new approaches to technology design. This paper presents a study in which 14 parents were prompted to reflect on how their experiences and relationships could be improved by four design proposals. These proposals resulted from ideation workshops involving 12 professional designers, and were presented as scenario-based storyboards during interviews. Our interviews revealed three design approaches that appealed to parents. We describe seven benefits that parents imagined these approaches would have, and discuss ways in which they should be further explored. Thus, we contribute to a more complete understanding of how technology design might better support parents’ aspirations for how devices are used within the family.

“Guilty of Talking Too Much”: How Psychotherapists Gamify Therapy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517437,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/7c72ljluu5eljbpwhay54qvb7e/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517437,"
Traditionally, game designers have driven the development process of psychotherapeutic games with psychotherapists playing a consultant role. In contrast, our study explores psychotherapists independently designing digitally gamified psychotherapy. Our workshop participants consisted of six psychotherapists who created gamified digital therapies with the design prompt of anxiety disorder. We analyze the resulting six prototypes from a game design and psychotherapy perspective. We present insights into strategies for digitally gamifying therapy and identify challenges and opportunities for the future of gamified psychotherapy, grounded in the experiences of psychotherapists designing such therapies. This study also reflects on the use of user-friendly development tools for independently curating gamified digital therapies, especially by non-technical users such as psychotherapists.

“I Shake The Package To Check If It's Mine” A Study of Package Fetching Practices and Challenges of Blind and Low Vision People in China,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502063,2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02704,"
With about 230 million packages delivered per day in 2020, fetching packages has become a routine for many city dwellers in China. When fetching packages, people usually need to go to collection sites of their apartment complexes or a KuaiDiGui, an increasingly popular type of self-service package pickup machine. However, little is known whether such processes are accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) city dwellers. We interviewed BLV people (N=20) living in a large metropolitan area in China to understand their practices and challenges of fetching packages. Our findings show that participants encountered difficulties in finding the collection site and localizing and recognizing their packages. When fetching packages from KuaiDiGuis, they had difficulty in identifying the correct KuaiDiGui, interacting with its touch screen, navigating the complex on-screen workflow, and opening the target compartment. We discuss design considerations to make the package fetching process more accessible to the BLV community.

Beyond Virtual Bazaar: How Social Commerce Promotes Inclusivity for the Traditionally Underserved Community in Chinese Developing Regions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517487,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517487,"
 The disadvantaged population is often underserved and marginalized in technology engagement: prior works show they are generally more reluctant and experience more barriers in adopting and engaging with mainstream technology. Here, we contribute to the HCI4D and ICTD literature through a novel “counter” case study on Chinese social commerce (e.g., Pinduoduo), which 1) first prospers among the traditionally underserved community from developing regions ahead of the more technologically advantaged communities, and 2) has been heavily engaged by this community. Through 12 in-depth interviews with social commerce users from the traditionally underserved community in Chinese developing regions, we demonstrate how social commerce, acting as a “virtual bazaar”, brings online the traditional offline socioeconomic lives the community has lived for ages, fits into the community’s social, cultural, and economic context, and thus effectively promotes technology inclusivity. Our work provides novel insights and implications for building inclusive technology for the “next billion” population.

Investigating clutching interactions for touchless medical imaging systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517512,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517512,"
Touchless input could transform clinical activity by allowing health professionals direct control over medical imaging systems in a sterile manner. Currently, users face the issues of being unable to directly manipulate imaging in aseptic environments, as well as needing to touch shared surfaces in other hospital areas. Unintended input is a key challenge for touchless interaction and could be especially disruptive in medical contexts. We evaluated four clutching techniques with 34 health professionals, measuring interaction performance and interviewing them to obtain insight into their views on clutching, and touchless control of medical imaging. As well as exploring the performance of the different clutching techniques, our analysis revealed an appetite for reliable touchless interfaces, a strong desire to reduce shared surface contact, and suggested potential improvements such as combined authentication and touchless control. Our findings can inform the development of novel touchless medical systems and identify challenges for future research.

A state-based medication routine framework,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517519,2,https://blogs.iu.edu/claracaldeira/files/2022/03/MedicationFramework-CHI22.pdf,"
Forgetfulness is a primary factor of medication nonadherence, a problem that contributes to worse health outcomes and increased mortality among people with chronic conditions. Common strategies to address forgetfulness, such as timed reminders, have limited effectiveness. However, there is limited information about why these strategies fail. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with people who take medications daily and miss doses at least twice a month. We contribute a state-based Medication Routine Framework composed of four states (Wellness, New Task, Erratic, and Disruption) in two axes (regularity and time scale). Because most nonadherence due to forgetfulness occurs in nonroutine states (i.e., Erratic and Disruption state), we argue that improving technology for medication adherence requires designing for these states. In this paper, we describe each state in detail and discuss opportunities for adapting medication reminder strategies to overcome the challenges of nonroutine states.

"Exploring Technology-Mediated Parental Socialisation of Emotion: Leveraging an Embodied, In-situ Intervention for Child Emotion Regulation",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502130,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502130,"
 Emotion-related parent-child interactions during early childhood play a crucial role in the development of emotion regulation, a fundamental life skill central to well-being. However, limited work in HCI has explored how technology could support parents in adopting supportive emotion socialisation practices. In this paper, we explore how an embodied, in-situ intervention in the form of a smart toy can impact emotion-related parent-child interactions in the home. We draw on (1) interviews with 29 parents of young children who had the smart toy for at least 1 month; (2) co-design workshops with 12 parents and 8 parenting course facilitators. We discuss how the smart toy impacted parent-child interactions around emotions for a subset of families, and draw on workshop data to explore how this could be designed for directly. Finally, we propose a set of design directions for technology-enabled systems aiming to elicit and scaffold specific parent-child interactions over time.

“A Voice that Suits the Situation”: Understanding the Needs and Challenges for Supporting End-User Voice Customization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501856,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/yk7chjm5bnb33la2rgwk5evi5e/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501856,"
 Although there is a potential demand for customizing voices, most customization is limited to the visual appearance of a figure (e.g., avatars). To better understand the users’ need, we first conducted an online survey with 104 participants. Then we conducted a semi-structured interview with a prototype with 14 participants to identify design considerations for supporting voice customization. The results show that there is a desire for voice customization especially for non-face-to-face conversations with someone unfamiliar. In addition, the findings revealed that different voices are favored for different contexts from a better version of one’s own voice for improving delivery to a completely different voice for securing identity. As future work, we plan to extend this study by investigating voice synthesis techniques for end-users who wish to design their own voices for various contexts.

A study of solar cooking: exploring climate-resilient food preparation and opportunities for HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517557,3,https://sandsystems.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3491102.3517557.pdf,"
As parts of our planet continue to experience extreme heat waves, it is more urgent than ever for human-food interaction research to examine climate-resilient and sustainable food practices. Our work, conducted in the hottest city in the USA, focuses on solar cooking as a set of creative DIY activities that use extreme heat and mitigate human impact on the environment. We report on a summer-long study whereby 7 enthusiasts built solar ovens from scratch and experimented with solar recipes ranging from slow-cooked pork and chicken to bread, kale chips, brownies, jerky, and fruit rollups. Our findings depict solar cooking as a form of iterative DIY, which, through its challenges and creative workarounds, serves as a point of engagement with both food and extreme heat. We reflect on solar cooking as a climate-resilient food practice and conclude with design considerations for HCI to support solar cooking as a habitual community practice.

Cicero: A declarative grammar for responsive visualization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517455,4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08314,"
 Designing responsive visualizations can be cast as applying transformations to a source view to render it suitable for a different screen size. However, designing responsive visualizations is often tedious as authors must manually apply and reason about candidate transformations. We present Cicero, a declarative grammar for concisely specifying responsive visualization transformations which paves the way for more intelligent responsive visualization authoring tools. Cicero’s flexible specifier syntax allows authors to select visualization elements to transform, independent of the source view’s structure. Cicero encodes a concise set of actions to encode a diverse set of transformations in both desktop-first and mobile-first design processes. Authors can ultimately reuse design-agnostic transformations across different visualizations. To demonstrate the utility of Cicero, we develop a compiler to an extended version of Vega-Lite, and provide principles for our compiler. We further discuss the incorporation of Cicero into responsive visualization authoring tools, such as a design recommender.

A Human-Centric Perspective on Fairness and Transparency in Algorithmic Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503811,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00033,"
 Automated decision systems (ADS) are increasingly used for consequential decision-making. These systems often rely on sophisticated yet opaque machine learning models, which do not allow for understanding how a given decision was arrived at. This is not only problematic from a legal perspective, but non-transparent systems are also prone to yield unfair outcomes because their sanity is challenging to assess and calibrate in the first place—which is particularly worrisome for human decision-subjects. Based on this observation and building upon existing work, I aim to make the following three main contributions through my doctoral thesis: (a) understand how (potential) decision-subjects perceive algorithmic decisions (with varying degrees of transparency of the underlying ADS), as compared to similar decisions made by humans; (b) evaluate different tools for transparent decision-making with respect to their effectiveness in enabling people to appropriately assess the quality and fairness of ADS; and (c) develop human-understandable technical artifacts for fair automated decision-making. Over the course of the first half of my PhD program, I have already addressed substantial pieces of (a) and (c), whereas (b) will be the major focus of the second half.

 Typing on mobile devices is a common and complex task. The act of typing itself thereby encodes rich information, such as the typing method, the context it is performed in, and individual traits of the person typing. Researchers are increasingly using a selection or combination of experience sampling and passive sensing methods in real-world settings to examine typing behaviours. However, there is limited understanding of the effects these methods have on measures of input speed, typing behaviours, compliance, perceived trust and privacy. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs of everyday data collection methods. We contribute empirical results from a four-week field study (N=26). Here, participants contributed by transcribing, composing, passively having sentences analyzed and reflecting on their contributions. We present a tradeoff analysis of these data collection methods, discuss their impact on text-entry applications, and contribute a flexible research platform for in the wild text-entry studies.

How much do platform workers value reviews? An experimental method,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501900,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501900,"
 Previous qualitative work has documented that platform workers place an immense importance on their reputation due to the use of algorithmic management by online labor platforms. We provide a general experimental method, which can be used across platforms and time, for numerically quantifying the intensity with which platform workers experience reputation system-based algorithmic management. Our method works via an experiment where workers choose between a monetary bonus or a positive review. We demonstrate this method by measuring the value that freelancers assigned to positive feedback on Upwork in June 2020. The median freelancer in our sample valued a single positive review at ∼ $49 USD. We also find that less experienced freelancers valued a positive review more highly than those with more experience. Qualitative data collected during the experiment indicates that many freelancers considered issues related to reputation system-based algorithmic management while choosing between the monetary reward and the positive review.

Iterative design of gestures during elicitation: Understanding the role of increased production,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501962,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501962,"
Previous gesture elicitation studies have found that user proposals are influenced by legacy bias which may inhibit users from proposing gestures that are most appropriate for an interaction. Increasing production during elicitation studies has shown promise moving users beyond legacy gestures. However, variety decreases as more symbols are produced. While several studies have used increased production since its introduction, little research has focused on understanding the effect on the proposed gesture quality, on why variety decreases, and on whether increased production should be limited. In this paper, we present a gesture elicitation study aimed at understanding the impact of increased production. We show that users refine the most promising gestures and that how long it takes to find promising gestures varies by participant. We also show that gestural refinements provide insight into the gestural features that matter for users to assign semantic meaning and discuss implications for training gesture classifiers.

 Board gaming is a popular hobby that increasingly features the inclusion of technology, yet little research has sought to understand how board game player experience is impacted by digital augmentation or to inform the design of new technology-enhanced games. We present a mixed-methods study exploring how the presence of music and sound effects impacts the player experience of a board game. We found that the soundtrack increased the enjoyment and tension experienced by players during game play. We also found that a soundtrack provided atmosphere surrounding the gaming experience, though players did not necessarily experience this as enhancing the world-building capabilities of the game. We discuss how our findings can inform the design of new games and soundtracks as well as future research into board game player experience.

 By sensing how a user is holding a smartphone, adaptive user interfaces are possible such as those that automatically switch the displayed content and position of graphical user interface (GUI) components following how the phone is being held. We propose ReflecTouch, a novel method for detecting how a smartphone is being held by capturing images of the smartphone screen reflected on the cornea with a built-in front camera. In these images, the areas where the user places their fingers on the screen appear as shadows, which makes it possible to estimate the grasp posture. Since most smartphones have a front camera, this method can be used regardless of the device model; in addition, no additional sensor or hardware is required. We conducted data collection experiments to verify the classification accuracy of the proposed method for six different grasp postures, and the accuracy was 85%.

 By CHI 2022, fifteen years will have passed since the emergence of Sustainable HCI (SHCI), which now constitutes an important subfield of HCI. In this paper, we draw on two SHCI corpora to ask: Has SHCI progressed? How has the field responded to prominent critiques? Have we identified and adopted constructive strategies for impacting environmental unsustainability? We further show the wide array of competencies SHCI researchers have been called to develop, and how this has been reflected in subsequent work. Our analysis identifies significant shifts in the SHCI landscape, toward research that is diverse and holistic, but also away from efforts to address the urgent climate crisis. We posit that SHCI has tended to take on far more than it could reasonably expect to deliver, and propose ‘Green Policy informatics’ as a pathway that enables SHCI to leverage a more traditional HCI skillset in addressing climate change.

Towards Equitable Futures in Frontline Health: Design of Intelligent Systems for Supporting (Gendered) Care Work in Resource-Constrained Settings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503808,0,,"
 Frontline health workers in many countries are responsible for filling gaps in essential primary health infrastructure, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their work increasingly involves the use of purportedly “intelligent” systems or data collection for such systems, to support diagnosis, disease forecasting, and information delivery. My research aims to inform the design of data-driven and automated systems in frontline health work, particularly for women workers in low-level and precarious roles in the Global South. Drawing from literature in the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), gender and development studies, and health informatics, I will critically examine health workers’ experiences and relationships with “intelligent” systems, and engage in the participatory design of technology that might better serve worker needs while strengthening the frontline health ecology overall.

 Our physical environments integrate more and more sensing, processing, and communications technology toward the realization of the vision of Ambient Intelligence (AmI). At the same time, virtual worlds are increasingly more linked to physical spaces by means of applications delivering the vision of Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR). In this context, several opportunities emerge at the intersection of these two visions of computing. The goal of this course is to achieve the realization that AmI and MR are two sides of the same coin in order to deliver a fresh perspective to HCI researchers and practitioners interested in designing interactive experiences beyond the desktop and mobile computing paradigms by employing the concepts, principles, and methods of AmI and MR.

This study presents the evaluation of ability-based methods extended to keyboard generation for alternative communication in people with dexterity impairments due to motor disabilities. Our approach characterizes user-specific cursor control abilities from a multidirectional point-select task to configure letters on a virtual keyboard based on estimated time, distance, and direction of movement. These methods were evaluated in three individuals with motor disabilities against a generically optimized keyboard and the ubiquitous QWERTY keyboard. We highlight key observations relating to the heterogeneity of the manifestation of motor disabilities, perceived importance of communication technology, and quantitative improvements in communication performance when characterizing an individual's movement abilities to design personalized AAC interfaces.

# facebookdown: Time to panic or detox? Understanding users' reactions to social media outage,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519674,0,,"
Non-use, particularly involuntary non-use, is an under-researched topic in HCI research, even though it has become quite common nowadays due to frequent digital outages. How do users react to social media outage? Do they become anxious? Or, do they enjoy these brief episodes of social media detox? To answer these questions, we conducted a topic modeling analysis of 223,815 tweets that used the hashtag #facebookdown during the major Facebook outage on 10/4/2021. We uncovered 10 major themes of users’ reactions towards social media outage. Results showed that most users complained, mocked and showed desperation about the outage situation, and during the outage period, increased their quest for other social-media alternatives. Also, surprisingly, many users celebrated the detox from Facebook rather than wishing it to come back as soon as possible. Results offer design implications for practitioners who would like to better respond to future outages.

"Analyzing Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Users' Behavior, Usage, and Interaction with a Personal Assistant Device that Understands Sign-Language Input",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501987,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/lpnbscpfijhodlxax2pctdepwa/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501987,"
 As voice-based personal assistant technologies proliferate, e.g., smart speakers in homes, and more generally as voice-control of technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous, new accessibility barriers are emerging for many Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) users. Progress in sign-language recognition may enable devices to respond to sign-language commands and potentially mitigate these barriers, but research is needed to understand how DHH users would interact with these devices and what commands they would issue. In this work, we directly engage with the DHH community, using a Wizard-of-Oz prototype that appears to understand American Sign Language (ASL) commands. Our analysis of video recordings of DHH participants revealed how they woke-up the device to initiate commands, structured commands in ASL, and responded to device errors, providing guidance to future designers and researchers. We share our dataset of over 1400 commands, which may be of interest to sign-language-recognition researchers.

Two-handed Design: Development of Food Personality Framework Using Mixed Method Needfinding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503554,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/84638511/chi22extendedabstracts_7_CHI22_Case_study_final_draft_.pdf,"
 In this case study, we present a mixed methodology approach to needfinding, integrating in-depth qualitative interview data with machine learning-powered analysis of a larger dataset. The research is motivated by the high failure rates and low involvement of consumers in the food startup industry’s product design process. To help food startups design products in a more consumer-friendly and timely manner, we are developing a novel framework called the Food Personality Framework (FPF). This framework categorizes eaters according to their eating habits, preferences, motivations and constraints. To better understand the complex relationships between motivations, we chose Grounded Theory as the most pertinent approach and interviewed 14 singles with full autonomy over their food choices. We further leveraged the availability of large online food-related datasets to inform and reinforce our findings from the qualitative work. We analyzed 6687 user behaviors of Food.com, a popular recipe recommendation site, according to the 18 influencers of food choice identified from the qualitative interviews. We found three meaningful clusters of user behavior: Minimalists, Social Butterflies and Conscious eaters. The interview data, thus, enabled grounded classification of the large scale user behavior and provided a grounded way to interpret the relationship among the top motivators identified in each clusters. The cluster analysis will inform future sampling of interviewees and will provide new insightful questions for the qualitative research. The case study delineates a dynamic interplay of qualitative and quantitative data used to investigate human food choice, a novel domain in the Human-Food Interaction literature.

 Advanced technologies are increasingly enabling the creation of freeform devices: interactive devices with non-rectangular form-factors. We explore the applications they inspire and how users may interact with such freeform devices. In a week-long design workshop, we invited non-specialist designers to invent freeform devices and reflect on their myriad form factors and the applications they engender. We clustered their concepts into Introspection, Community and Magic Exploration applications, allowing to understand the perspective of non-specialists on freeform devices in real life.

Visualizing Uncertainty in Multi-Source Mental Health Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519844,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519844,"
 Self-tracking technologies, especially those facilitating support from social systems, are becoming more common for treating serious mental illnesses in both clinical and informal contexts. A recently proposed feature is co-tracking, where data is gathered not only from the perspective of the user managing their condition, but also from their close contacts. The proposed system therefore supports multiple perspectives (data streams) about the same variable of interest (i.e., an individual’s mood). However, the subjective and reciprocal nature of mental health data gives rise to challenges in visualizing uncertainty that must be addressed before clinical use. Here, we create an application-specific typology of uncertainty for visualizing multi-source mental health data, and propose design solutions to communicate this uncertainty. Via a case study of mood tracking with bipolar disorder, we present an interactive visualization prototype for understanding dynamic mood states in close relationships, moving toward a real-world implementation of a co-tracking informatics system.

As concerns around climate change escalate, the need to address the environmental impacts of computing becomes more dire. While urgent action is needed, there is also opportunity to rectify longstanding inequities and injustices present in the relationship between computing and the environment. The aim of this one-day hybrid workshop is to gather researchers and practitioners and develop a material ethics of computing. We frame material ethics as a shared understanding of the relations between material and labor that shape digital infrastructures. Through presentations, discussions, and facilitated activities, we aim to build a research community to understand how computing facilitate sites of environmental damage and degradation, and also spaces for justice, change, and hope.

Watch Your Flavors: Augmenting People's Flavor Perceptions and Associated Emotions based on Videos Watched while Eating,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519846,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meetha-James/publication/360266068_Watch_Your_Flavors_Augmenting_People%27s_Flavor_Perceptions_and_Associated_Emotions_based_on_Videos_Watched_while_Eating/links/63fd09140cf1030a5657e57e/Watch-Your-Flavors-Augmenting-Peoples-Flavor-Perceptions-and-Associated-Emotions-based-on-Videos-Watched-while-Eating.pdf,"
 People engage in different activities while eating alone, such as watching television or scrolling through social media on their phones. However, the impacts of these visual contents on human cognitive processes, particularly related to flavor perception and its attributes, are still not thoroughly explored. This paper presents a user study to evaluate the influence of six different types of video content (including nature, cooking, and a new food video genre known as mukbang) on people’s flavor perceptions in terms of taste sensations, liking, and emotions while eating plain white rice. Our findings revealed that the participants’ flavor perceptions are augmented based on different video content, indicating significant differences in their perceived taste sensations (e.g., increased perception of salty and spicy sensations). Furthermore, potential future implications are revealed to promote digital commensality and healthier eating habits.

Should Siri be a Source or Medium for Ads? The Role of Source Orientation and User Motivations in User Responses to Persuasive Content from Voice Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519667,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/w4lvu7ot4ndm7mp4ie3obhv4ay/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519667,"
As demonstrated by users’ resistance to ads on Google Home in 2017, persuasive communications from voice assistants (VAs) can be seen as inappropriate. But, they may be better received if the VAs are not the sources but mere media for ads, as happens with radio. User motives may play a role as well, with those who use VAs primarily for information resenting ads more than those who see their VAs as social companions. To test such propositions, we conducted a scenario-based user study (N = 264) in which Siri acted as either a source of ads or as a medium for delivering ads by a human spokesperson. Findings suggest that for informationally motivated users, Siri as ad source causes reactance via lowered sense of control over the interaction. On the other hand, for those with social motives, it increases social presence and positively affects user experience of the interaction.

Automated mapping of competitive and collaborative overlapping talk in video meetings.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519612,0,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2022/03/Margariti-CHI22-LBW-CameraReady.pdf,"
Video meetings are notorious for difficulties with conversational turn-taking, which has impacts on inclusion and outcomes. We present a scalable automatic process to categorize turn-taking patterns in remote meetings based on eyes-off analysis of meeting transcripts. Drawing on a series of remote meetings (10 series, 34 total meetings) recorded in July-August 2021 by employees of a global technology company, we identified and parametrized patterns of cooperative and competitive overlaps of turns. The results show initial success characterizing people's behaviours as either likely to continue or cede turns based on either the amount of overlap that they produce during other's turns or the amount of overlap they experience in their own turns. With further development and validation, this method could be used to measure inclusion in remote and hybrid meetings.

RaITIn: Radar-Based Identification for Tangible Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519808,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519808,"
Radar is primarily used for applications like tracking and large-scale ranging, and its use for object identification has been rarely explored. This paper introduces RaITIn, a radar-based identification (ID) method for tangible interactions. Unlike conventional radar solutions, RaITIn can track and identify objects on a tabletop scale. We use frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensors to classify different objects embedded with low-cost radar reflectors of varying sizes on a tabletop setup. We also introduce Stackable IDs, where different objects can be stacked and combined to produce unique IDs. The result allows RaITIn to accurately identify visually identical objects embedded with different low-cost reflector configurations. When combined with a radar’s ability for tracking, it creates novel tabletop interaction modalities. We discuss possible applications and areas for future work.

Gesture Elicitation as a Computational Optimization Problem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501942,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501942,"
 Gesture elicitation studies are commonly used for designing novel gesture-based interfaces. There is a rich methodology literature on metrics and analysis methods that helps researchers understand and characterize data arising from such studies. However, deriving concrete gesture vocabularies from this data, which is often the ultimate goal, remains largely based on heuristics and ad hoc methods. In this paper, we treat the problem of deriving a gesture vocabulary from gesture elicitation data as a computational optimization problem. We show how to formalize it as an optimal assignment problem and discuss how to express objective functions and custom design constraints through integer programs. In addition, we introduce a set of tools for assessing the uncertainty of optimization outcomes due to random sampling, and for supporting researchers’ decisions on when to stop collecting data from a gesture elicitation study. We evaluate our methods on a large number of simulated studies.

A Case Study on the Rapid Development of Natural and Synergistic Multimodal Interfaces for XR Use-Cases,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503552,0,https://downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/2022-chi-case-study-mmi-zimmerer.pdf,"
 Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) supporting the synergistic use of natural modalities like speech and gesture have been conceived as promising for spatial or 3D interactions, e.g., in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (XR for short). Yet, the currently prevailing user interfaces are unimodal. Commercially available software platforms like the Unity or Unreal game engines simplify the complexity of developing XR applications through appropriate tool support. They provide ready-to-use device integration, e.g., for 3D controllers or motion tracking, and according interaction techniques such as menus, (3D) point-and-click, or even simple symbolic gestures to rapidly develop unimodal interfaces. A comparable tool support is yet missing for multimodal solutions in this and similar areas. We believe that this hinders user-centered research based on rapid prototyping of MMIs, the identification and formulation of practical design guidelines, the development of killer applications highlighting the power of MMIs, and ultimately a widespread adoption of MMIs. This article investigates potential reasons for the ongoing uncommonness of MMIs. Our case study illustrates and analyzes lessons learned during the development and application of a toolchain that supports rapid development of natural and synergistic MMIs for XR use-cases. We analyze the toolchain in terms of developer usability, development time, and MMI customization. This analysis is based on the knowledge gained in years of research and academic education. Specifically, it reflects on the development of appropriate MMI tools and their application in various demo use-cases, in user-centered research, and in the lab work of a mandatory MMI course of an HCI master’s program. The derived insights highlight successful choices made as well as potential areas for improvement.

Multifractal Mice: Operationalising Dimensions of Readiness-to-hand via a Feature of Hand Movement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517601,3,https://psyarxiv.com/729xw/download,"
The philosophical construct readiness-to-hand describes focused, intuitive, tool use, and has been linked to tool-embodiment and immersion. The construct has been influential in HCI and design for decades, but researchers currently lack appropriate measures and tools to investigate it empirically. To support such empirical work we investigate the possibility of operationalising readiness-to-hand in measurements of multfractality in movement, building on recent work in cognitive science. We conduct two experiments (N=44, N=30) investigating multifractality in mouse movements during a computer game, replicating prior results and contributing new findings. Our results show that multifractality correlates with dimensions associated with readiness-to-hand, including skill and task-engagement, during tool breakdown, task learning and normal play. We describe future possibilities for the application of these methods in HCI, supporting such work by sharing scripts and data (https://osf.io/2hm9u/), and introducing a new data-driven approach to parameter selection.

Evolution of the Competencies to Embrace Digital Technology for Sustainable Development,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519730,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalia-Dneprovskaya/publication/360269083_Evolution_of_the_Competencies_to_Embrace_Digital_Technology_for_Sustainable_Development/links/6273e50c107cae29198be2c5/Evolution-of-the-Competencies-to-Embrace-Digital-Technology-for-Sustainable-Development.pdf,"
The paper aims to highlight the way how competencies are changing, following technological progress and new tasks for sustainable development. New social challenges demand a new generation of competencies to apply technologies to produce positive effects on the wellbeing of society. There are known approaches to describing the competencies based on the assumption that they are applicable to any industry, but they are not. We suggest considering the quantity and quality of competencies in the context of industry, identifying the special abilities for its improvement with help of digital technologies. The industrial transformation promotes sustainability if it is based on a deep understanding of technology and industry. The result of this research is the designed concept of competencies for digital transformation based on a variety of industries. This is a preliminary step for advancing the existing concepts of digital competencies to transform the industry to support sustainable development.

Emerging Telepresence Technologies in Hybrid Learning Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503728,0,https://clok.uclan.ac.uk/42000/1/42000.pdf,"
 The last several years have seen a strong growth of telerobotic technologies with promising implications for many areas of learning. HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on user experiences and user interfaces of telepresence robots. However, only a few telerobot studies have addressed everyday use in real-world learning environments. In the post-COVID 19 world, sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen challenges to learning in hybrid learning environments constitute a unique frontier where robotic and immersive technologies can mediate learning experiences. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods for use of immersive and telerobotic technologies in real-world learning environments. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on robot-mediated learning in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts regarding telerobots for learning.

Trading Accuracy for Enjoyment? Data Quality and Player Experience in Data Collection Games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502025,2,https://files.de-1.osf.io/v1/resources/9fqve/providers/osfstorage/624c0dc9746f59053b4a6583?format=pdf&action=download&direct&version=1,"
 Games have become a popular way of collecting human subject data, based on the premise that they are more engaging than surveys or experiments, but generate equally valid data. However, this premise has not been empirically tested. In response, we designed a game for eliciting linguistic data following Intrinsic Elicitation – a design approach aiming to minimise validity threats in data collection games – and compared it to an equivalent linguistics experiment as control. In a preregistered study and replication (n=96 and n=136), using two different ways of operationalising accuracy, the game generated substantially more enjoyment (d=.70,.73) and substantially less accurate data (d=-.68, -.40) – though still more accurate than random responding. We conclude that for certain data types data collection games may present a serious trade-off between participant enjoyment and data quality, identify possible causes of lower data quality for future research, reflect on our design approach, and urge games HCI researchers to use careful controls where appropriate.

Exploring Technology Usage of Southeast Asian Elderly Women for Better Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519675,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/86747073/3491101.pdf,"
 The elderly population worldwide got immensely affected by the increased isolation and risk for complications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, elderly women get more affected by social isolation and distress irrespective of health factors. We aim to understand how urban elderly women in Southeast Asia – typically highly dependent on the other family members due to cultural practices – took care of their mental health with uncertainty and distress using technology during the social distance period. Through 19 semi-structured interviews with participants from six Southeast Asian countries and analyzing the data using thematic analysis, we surfaced that our participants started learning different technology with great enthusiasm and used them for their mental well-being during the pandemic period. This paper portrays how our participants enhanced interpersonal bonding, cultivated self-care and creative outlets, and facilitated positivism around their social circle using different technology platforms to mitigate their stress and uncertainty during the pandemic. Our participants’ technology usage for better mental well-being during the COVID-19 period provides HCI researchers with valuable design guidelines. Here, we contribute by expanding the HCI community’s understanding of technology design within the intersection of the elderly population and mental health for the Southeast Asian cultural context.

The LilyTiny: A Case Study in Expanding Access to Electronic Textiles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503579,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily-Lovell-6/publication/360408199_The_LilyTiny_A_Case_Study_in_Expanding_Access_to_Electronic_Textiles/links/62eb25d6505511283e8ad4d5/The-LilyTiny-A-Case-Study-in-Expanding-Access-to-Electronic-Textiles.pdf,"
 The LilyTiny sewable microcontroller was created ten years ago, in an effort to make electronic textiles more accessible. At the time, e-textiles was gaining traction as a means to invite more diverse participation in computing, but financial and instructional barriers stood in the way of broader adoption. In addition, there existed a scaffolding gap between projects involving lights, batteries, and thread – and those requiring programming (i.e. leveraging the LilyPad Arduino and/or additional sensors or outputs). In an effort to expand access to electronic textiles, we designed the LilyTiny, an inexpensive, pre-programmed sewable microcontroller which controls assorted LED patterns, and which later became available for purchase through SparkFun. Alongside the LilyTiny, we released a free workshop guide for educators which details five low-cost activities that can be taught without any prior electronics experience.  This paper summarizes our development of the LilyTiny and companion curriculum – and reflects on whether we met our stated goal of expanding access to electronic textiles in the decade since. We share and discuss some measures of impact, including a survey of derivative products and a multi-year analysis of sales data from the LilyTiny’s sole distributor SparkFun Electronics.

TriboTouch: Micro-Patterned Surfaces for Low Latency Touchscreens,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502069,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3502069,"
 Touchscreen tracking latency, often 80ms or more, creates a rubber-banding effect in everyday direct manipulation tasks such as dragging, scrolling, and drawing. This has been shown to decrease system preference, user performance, and overall realism of these interfaces. In this research, we demonstrate how the addition of a thin, 2D micro-patterned surface with 5 micron spaced features can be used to reduce motor-visual touchscreen latency. When a finger, stylus, or tangible is translated across this textured surface frictional forces induce acoustic vibrations which naturally encode sliding velocity. This acoustic signal is sampled at 192kHz using a conventional audio interface pipeline with an average latency of 28ms. When fused with conventional low-speed, but high-spatial-accuracy 2D touch position data, our machine learning model can make accurate predictions of real time touch location.

Fabricate It or Render It? Digital Fabrication vs. Virtual Reality for Creating Objects Instantly,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516510,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146146/3491101.3516510.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
 In the technical human-computer interaction (HCI) community, two research fields that gained significant popularity in the last decade are digital fabrication and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Although the two fields deal with different technical challenges, both aim for a single end goal: creating ”objects” instantly – either by fabricating them physically or rendering them virtually. In this panel, we will discuss the pros and cons of both approaches, discuss which one may prevail in the future, and what opportunities exist for closer collaboration between researchers from the two research fields.

Runners want to actively explore unknown environments without the fear of getting lost. We conducted a survey to better understand runners’ needs and practices in this context. The survey results emphasized the interest in flexible exploration. To address this interest, we designed FlexNav, a system that supports exploratory running through flexible tours that link the best runnable zones in a neighbourhood. FlexNav provides adaptive navigation support enabling runners to follow such tours without continually getting disruptive directions. We tested it with runners to assess its usability. The results confirm the usefulness of the system and the users' preference for flexible tours over fully specified tours with turn-by-turn guidance. Our study highlights the subjective nature of runnable zones and the subtle balance between guidance and exploration.

VR-Based Kinematic Assessments: Examining the Effects of Task Properties on Arm Movement Kinematics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519841,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/stjojonjnjfm3aarucv2ucwouu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519841,"
In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise as a means of delivering rehabilitative care to restore arm function in stroke patients. At the same time, limitations of traditional clinical scales for measuring arm function recovery have led to the more widespread use of kinematic metrics. These metrics quantify useful properties of patients’ movements using motion tracking data captured while the patient performs different types of assessment tasks. Given modern consumer VR systems already collect the data needed to calculate many common kinematic metrics, these systems could eventually be used to both deliver stroke rehabilitation programs and administer kinematic assessments to monitor patients’ recovery. However, it is not yet clear how the properties of VR-based assessment tasks may systematically impact the values of kinematic metrics used to assess arm function post-stroke. To begin addressing this question, we examined the influence of two task properties (movement direction and hand dominance) on a set of 10 kinematic metrics during a discrete reaching task performed by healthy participants using an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. Our findings indicate that all 10 metrics were significantly impacted by these task properties, confirming that kinematic metrics captured in this context are sensitive to task properties. Our results also provide an initial account of how the metrics were influenced by each task property and highlight needs for future work to further understand the influence of assessment task properties on VR-based kinematic assessments.

“Sometimes I feel that I'm being left behind”: Exploring Computing Device Use by People with Upper Extremity Impairment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519647,0,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10347152,"
 In this paper, we explore how computing device use by people with upper extremity impairment (UEI) was affected by COVID-19. Someone with UEI has reduced use of their shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, and/or fingers. We conducted six (6) semi-structured interviews with participants with UEI in the US. We found that people with UEI increased computing device use during COVID-19 not only for remote interactions but also in person. Additionally, social distancing for COVID-19 safety created the need for new assistive technology (AT), authentication requirements, and communication platforms, which introduced their own accessibility barriers. We also found that personal protective equipment (PPE) created new barriers during computing device use, which often caused people with UEI to choose COVID-19 safety over the usability of their computing devices. Based on these findings, we describe future opportunities to make computing devices more accessible for people with UEI to manage the shifts in computing device use introduced by COVID-19.

 We present SipBit, a sensing platform that digitally recognizes beverages and their attributes, an essential component in facilitating novel human-food interactions. SipBit consists of an electrical impedance measurement unit and a recognition method based on deep learning techniques. First, impedance measurements of a beverage are acquired using Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy. Then, a multi-task network cascade algorithm was employed to identify eight different beverage types in various volume levels and sugar concentrations. Results show that the multi-task network cascade discriminates beverage types with an accuracy of 96.32%, and estimates volumes with a root mean square error of 13.74ml and sugar content with a root mean square error of 7.99gdm− 3. Future work will include: 1) developing utensils embedded with SipBit for automatic beverage and attribute recognition, and 2) further developing SipBit to recognize additional beverage types and their attributes, thus enabling a new avenue for designing human-food interactive technologies.

Promoting healthy and active lifestyles is an important objective for many governing agencies. The design of active urban environments can be an effective tool to encourage more active behaviors and water features can attract people, improving their experience of the urban space. To explore the potential of these concepts, we designed Fontana; an interactive public installation that aims to stimulate physical activity and social connectedness in the urban outdoor space, using the multidimensional attractiveness of water. We focus on the use of embedded interactive technology to promote physical activity, using water as a linking element between users. Adopting a research-through-design approach, we explored how such installations can nudge people into an active behavior while additionally strengthening social connectedness, using inclusive design principles. We report on insights gathered through this case study and findings of a preliminary user test, discussing the implications of this work for design researchers and practitioners.

 COVID-19 has been known to have a disproportionate impact on African Americans in the United States. Although studies have been conducted on the reasons for this disparity, there has been less focus on how the African American population sought trustworthy health information using technology. This is important because African Americans’ mistrust of the medical system has been suggested as a possible reason for the disproportionate impact. Therefore, we conducted interviews with 18 African Americans with chronic conditions to discover what types of challenges they faced while searching for trustworthy information on COVID-19 and the strategies they used to overcome these challenges. We found that participants actively evaluated the credibility of different information sources, searched for first-hand information from people they could relate to, and tried to avoid or reduce media consumption to prevent information overload.

Designing for Knowledge Construction to Facilitate the Uptake of Open Science: Laying out the Design Space,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517450,2,https://scholar.archive.org/work/4xsdfnq5yjg6xaovbpruepqn2e/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517450,"
 The uptake of open science resources needs knowledge construction on the side of the readers/receivers of scientific content. The design of technologies surrounding open science resources can facilitate such knowledge construction, but this has not been investigated yet. To do so, we first conducted a scoping review of literature, from which we draw design heuristics for knowledge construction in digital environments. Subsequently, we grouped the underlying technological functionalities into three design categories: i) structuring and supporting collaboration, ii) supporting the learning process, and iii) structuring, visualising and navigating (learning) content. Finally, we mapped the design categories and associated design heuristics to core components of popular open science platforms. This mapping constitutes a design space (design implications), which informs researchers and designers in the HCI community about suitable functionalities for supporting knowledge construction in existing or new digital open science platforms.

 Care work is often moralized as essential to the functioning of society, but has long been undervalued economically and politically, contributing to a global care crisis and prompting increased control and extraction of care work to stabilize capitalist systems. The role of emerging technologies in these politics of care is understudied, particularly in the Global South. My research looks at why and how emerging technologies are being introduced into care work in health in India and Kenya, uncovering the implications this has for how care work is done, care workers’ lives, and organizations deploying the technology. Drawing on cases of both harm and opportunity effected by technology, my work offers an empirical understanding of the role of technology in the politics of care work, and the implications this can have for the future of care work amidst a global care crisis.

Grasping the Grammar with Moovy: a Tangible User Interface to Train Linguistic Skills in Children,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519733,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/5qknxfxisfh2jex6livd6zdrgq/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519733,"
 Linguistic skills are the building blocks of one of the most resourceful abilities of human beings: communication. Compromised linguistic skills significantly reduce the understanding or exchanging of meaningful messages and information. Children with difficulties in this area are often enrolled in extensive speech therapy programs and, nowadays, such issues affect also bilingual children with a migrant background, impacting their quality of life. Our research explores a Tangible User Interface developed on a new paradigm we postulated called ”Embodied Argument Movement”. In this paper, we present Moovy, an engaging table-top game for rehabilitating challenging morphosyntactic constructs and improving language skills. We performed two pilot studies with 13 children; one to test the User Experience and the other to assess Moovy’s efficacy and the paradigm soundness. Preliminary results suggest that Moovy could make a difference in speech-therapies programs, fostering children to continue their therapy willingly and successfully.

Social Control Interaction Framework: Design to Technically Support a Group of Users in Making Control Decisions Together,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503802,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/lflhyror7fffvisnvzcecvanou/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503802,"
 Entertainment is enjoyable and helps people to feel socially connected with others. However, the control of entertainment applications in group situations is often restricted to one person. This especially limits group decision-making where people sit in close proximity such as in the living room or inside a car. Restricting users in group decision-making can cause interpersonal conflicts and frustration. To overcome these aspects, my PhD research aims to articulate design principles to support social control. I specifically focus on distributing control across group members to support collaborative group decision-making and enhance social connectedness. To achieve this, I will design entertainment-oriented social control services for the car and the living room. Based on the exploration and designs for the car domain, I will transfer the gained knowledge to the living room, to verify and generalize my findings. This should support in drawing an overall conclusion for the design of general social control entertainment services. Thus, my dissertation contributes to the understanding of the design for future, entertainment-oriented, distributed control systems to best support group collaboration.

Feasibility Studies in Indoor Localization through Intelligent Conversation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519617,0,https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8318&context=sis_research,"
 We propose a model to achieve human localization in indoor environments through intelligent conversation between users and an agent. We investigated the feasibility of conversational localization by conducting two studies. First, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with N = 7 participants and studied the feasibility of localizing users through conversation. We identified challenges posed by users’ language and behavior. Second, we collected N = 800 user descriptions of virtual indoor locations from N = 80 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants to analyze user language. We explored the effects of conversational agent behavior and observed that people describe indoor locations differently based on how the agent presents itself. We devise “Entity Suitability Scale,” a concrete and scalable approach to obtain information to support localization from the myriad of indoor entities users mention in their descriptions. Through this study, we lay foundation to our proposed paradigm of conversational localization.

Helping voice shoppers make purchase decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519828,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519828,"
 Online shoppers have a lot of information at their disposal when making a purchase decision. They can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. Voice shopping (purchasing items via a Voice assistant such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) is different. Voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel is limited in terms of the amount of information people can and are willing to absorb. Because of this, the system should choose the single most effective nugget of information to help the customer, and present the information succinctly. In this paper we report on a within-subject user study (N = 24), in which we employed three template-based methods that use information from customer reviews, product attributes and search relevance signals to generate helpful supporting information. Our results suggest that: (1) supporting information from customer reviews significantly improves participants perception of system effectiveness (helping them make good decisions); (2) supporting information based on search relevance signals improves user perception of system transparency (providing insight into how the system works). We discuss the implications of our findings for providing supporting information for customers shopping by Voice.

What Kinds of Experiences Do You Desire? A Preliminary Study of the Desired Experiences of Contributors to Location-Based Mobile Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519744,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/34nlftzquzfaniuhn2ho56arjy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519744,"
 Mobile crowdsourcing enables people to learn location-related information from others with diverse experiences and opinions. However, little research has investigated the expected quality of the location-related information users of mobile-crowdsourcing platforms, and the levels and types of relevant experience such users expect crowd members to possess, respectively. To fill this gap, we first conducted an interview study with 22 participants, which yielded five key information properties of the answers to location-based questions: objectivity, relativity, specificity, temporal regularity, and variability. Based on his//her stated perceptions of these properties of the requested information, we deemed each participant to desire at least one, and up to 10 main qualities of the information, and seven main aspects of contributors’ experience. A follow-up survey study was then used to quantify the characteristics of a list of location-related information according to the information properties that the 139 respondents perceived that information to have.

"A Collaborative System of Flying and Ground Robots with Universal Physical Coupling Interface (PCI), and the Potential Interactive Applications",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519766,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519766,"
 Flying and ground robots complement each other in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. We propose a collaborative system combining flying and ground robots, using a universal physical coupling interface (PCI) that allows for momentary connections and disconnections between multiple robots/devices. The proposed system may better utilize the complementary advantages of both flying and ground robots. We also describe various potential scenarios where such a system could be of benefit to interact with humans - namely, remote field works and rescue missions, transportation, healthcare, and education. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of such systems and consider deeper questions which should be studied in future work.

Calmbots: Exploring Possibilities of Multiple Insects with On-hand Devices and Flexible Controls as Creation Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516387,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/w5w6ry4jcrakdigan4kqwfvk7q/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3516387,"
 We introduce ”Calmbots” that are insects-based interfaces comprising multiple functions, i.e., drawing, display, transportation, or haptics. We explore possibilities of multiple insects as co-creation interfaces making artworks through insects indirectly, in contrast with BioArt where artworks are made by biological technology. Considering scalability, sustainability, or promotability of applying insects-based devices on creation activities in daily life situations, we utilize on-hand and efficient control system by AR markers and radio-based station, and propose efficient ways of controlling multiple insects reaching goals and transporting objects, and customize flexible option parts. In robust experimental trials, our results showed effective control on a group of three or five cockroaches with at-least 60% reaching accuracy, mobility on carpeted or cable-lines floor, and possible continuous control under certain time duration. Participants in a user study felt positive with Calmbots’ functions and expected more performance or appearance on activities or creation in daily life.

 This workshop transnationally triangulates race, capital, and technology to understand how colonialism and imperialism linger and mutate across various sites and scales. Furthermore, it brings together transnational HCI work that engages with critical ethnic studies as well as postcolonial and decolonial studies to intervene on the field’s long-standing epistemology and site focus on the West and fixation on the nation-state at large. Attention to colonial residual, geopolitical tensions, and historical specificities brings HCI in conversation with geopolitical shifts and their very real impacts on the practice and theory of technology design, while troubling the presumptions of who “gets to be human” in HCI. We invite papers and presentations that seek to: 1) triangulate sites of study; 2) draw from different disciplines, theoretical approaches, and methodologies; and 3) engage themes of transnational capital, race, and technology.

Contemporary 360° video players do not provide ways to let people explore the videos together. Tourgether360 addresses this problem for 360° tour videos using a pseudo-spatial navigation technique that provides both an overhead “context” view of the environment as a minimap, as well as a shared pseudo-3D environment for exploring the video. Collaborators appear as avatars along a track depending on their position in the video timeline and can point and synchronize their playback. In this work, we describe the intellectual precedents for this work, our design goals, and our implementation approach of Tourgether360. Finally, we discuss future work based on this prototype.

Expressive Auditory Gestures in a Voice-Based Pedagogical Agent,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517599,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/ghcdhxvx2zf2toqihkpfl2pt5m/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517599,"
 In this paper, we explore how expressive auditory gestures added to the speech of a pedagogical agent influence the human-agent relationship and learning outcomes. In a between-subjects experiment, 41 participants assumed the role of a tutor to teach a voice-based agent. The agent used either: expressive interjections (e.g.,“yay”, “hmm”, “oh”), brief expressive musical executions, or no auditory gestures at all (control condition), throughout the interaction. Overall, the results indicate that both gestures can positively affect the interaction, but in particular, interjections can significantly increase feelings of emotional rapport with the agent and enhance motivation in learners. The implications of our findings are discussed as our work adds to the understanding of conversational agent design and can be useful for education as well as other domains in which dialogue systems are used.

Mask removal isn't always convenient in public!–The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Device Usage and User Authentication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519804,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alia-Saad-5/publication/359730700_Mask_removal_isn%27t_always_convenient_in_public_-The_Impact_of_the_Covid-19_Pandemic_on_Device_Usage_and_User_Authentication/links/624bf57e21077329f2f3e8bc/Mask-removal-isnt-always-convenient-in-public-The-Impact-of-the-Covid-19-Pandemic-on-Device-Usage-and-User-Authentication.pdf,"
 The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our everyday lives and demands everyone to take countermeasures such as wearing masks or disinfecting their hands. However, while previous work suggests that these countermeasures may profoundly impact biometric authentication, an investigation of the actual impact is still missing. Hence, in this work, we present our findings from an online survey (n=334) on experienced changes in device usage and failures of authentication. Our results show significant changes in personal and shared device usage, as well as a significant increase in experienced failures when comparing the present situation to before the Covid-19 pandemic. From our qualitative analysis of participants’ responses, we derive potential reasons for these changes in device usage and increases in authentication failures. Our findings suggest that making authentication contactless is only one of the aspects relevant to encounter the novel challenges caused by the pandemic.

“Where did you first meet the owner?”–Exploring Usable Authentication for Smart Home Visitors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519777,0,http://florian-alt.org/unibw/wp-content/publications/prange2022chiea.pdf,"
 Visitors in smart homes might want to use certain device features, as far as permitted by the device owner (e.g., streaming music on a smart speaker). At the same time, protecting access to features from attackers is crucial, motivating a need for authentication. However, it is unclear if and how smart home visitors should authenticate as they usually do not have access to respective interfaces. We explore considerations for the design of authentication for visitors evolving around, e.g., the visitors themselves as well as the environment and concrete mechanisms. Moreover, we suggest a concrete idea: security questions to authenticate visitors in smart homes. In an interview study (N = 24), we found that owners and visitors appreciated the low effort and would adapt our approach. We conclude with future research directions that we hope will spark further discussions around the design of authentication for smart homes, considering visitors and owners alike.

” It Deserves to Be Further Developed”: A Study of Mainstream Web Interface Adaptability for People with Low Vision,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519622,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519622,"
 To provide accessible but also usable web interfaces to people with low vision (PLV), academics and regulators provide guidelines in the form of adaptation techniques, as well as adaptable interfaces. Following these recommendations, practitioners developed mainstream solutions such as the Microsoft Immersive Reader. With this kind of solution, PLV can adapt or customize web user interfaces in terms of style and structure. This study aims to explore the adaptation carried out by PLV. A mixed methods research design, including both accessibility and usability concerns, allowed us to capture the user interactions, observe them, and access their expressed perception of usability. Findings show the universal nature of mainstream solutions does not support the diversity of PLV. We believe that universal adaptability features better benefit users with less severe and more common visual impairments. Finally, we discuss potential improvements and future work to support a wider range of PLV.

“I Wanted to See How Bad it Was”: Online Self-screening as a Critical Transition Point Among Young Adults with Common Mental Health Conditions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501976,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501976,"
 Young adults have high rates of mental health conditions, yet they are the age group least likely to seek traditional treatment. They do, however, seek information about their mental health online, including by filling out online mental health screeners. To better understand online self-screening, and its role in help-seeking, we conducted focus groups with 50 young adults who voluntarily completed a mental health screener hosted on an advocacy website. We explored (1) catalysts for taking the screener, (2) anticipated outcomes, (3) reactions to the results, and (4) desired next steps. For many participants, the screener results validated their lived experiences of symptoms, but they were nevertheless unsure how to use the information to improve their mental health moving forward. Our findings suggest that online screeners can serve as a transition point in young people’s mental health journeys. We discuss design implications for online screeners, post-screener feedback, and digital interventions broadly.

Supporting Shy & Neurodivergent Children in Social Play,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503800,0,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10349038,"
There is an opportunity to support shy and neurodivergent children in the development of critical executive function (EF) skills through social play. Through a within-subjects study at a preschool and a remote Zoom observation case study of neurodivergent children and their parents, I have identified the potential for StoryCarnival, a system that supports evidence-based sociodramatic play activities through e-book stories, a play-planning app, and a tangible, adult-controlled voice agent, to empower shy children to more confidently engage with their peers, to motivate neurodivergent children through various modalities, to encourage neurodivergent children to engage in symbolic play, and to afford children different types of agency in different settings. Through my future work, I hope to confirm the validity of these findings and examine the potential for StoryCarnival to support inclusive play in mixed-abilities groups through a large-scale deployment study and field studies.

This research introduces “Tribo Tribe”, a technique for fabricating 3D tangible interactive interfaces capable of sensing movement inputs through ubiquitous materials. Tribo Tribe is built on the working principle of Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENG) to enable self-powered sensing to 3D systems. We introduce a tool kit that facilitates designers and makers to easily customise both prototyping and sensing through TENG technology. We also demonstrate four design possibilities for different fields to illustrate how Tribo Tribe can instrument TENG into 3D physical interactive prototypes (Figure 1).

Harmonized Banner Creation from Multimodal Design Assets,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519610,0,,"
Designing aesthetically pleasing single-page graphic designs (”banners”) that appeal to the target recipients is non-trivial and requires considerable human effort. Designers often start by collecting assets like background images, inspirational banners, and relevant taglines/textual phrases, and iterate over variants of the designs by testing different combinations of these assets for their current task. To expand creative processes beyond professionals, it is crucial to accelerate this tedious process of creating design variants. To this end, we propose an algorithm that takes as input multiple image and text elements to generate several visually pleasing banner designs harmonized for text colors, font styles, and the placement of these multimodal assets. The generated layout accounts for background image saliency and uses this to select typographic and color variants yielding the harmonized outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in generating aesthetic banners with the help of a crowdsourced experiment.

Gaze-based anxiety sensitive virtual social communication platform for individuals with autism,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519855,1,https://scholar.archive.org/work/62cboiab4jbxdlv6m5hu4t2z7m/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519855,"
Difficulties in social communication along with impairments in understanding other's emotions and exhibiting atypical gaze behavior while avoiding social cues are common concerns in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such deficits are reported to be related with social anxiety. Social anxiety often deters the process of skill learning. Given the dramatic rise in the prevalence of ASD and limited availability of trained therapists, getting access to technology-assisted platforms that can estimate one's anxiety and autonomously vary the task challenges for effective skill learning is critical. The potential of gaze-related indices to serve as biomarkers to one's anxiety, and advancement in computing technologies allowing real-time access to gaze-related social signals, we have designed a Virtual Reality (VR)-based anxiety-sensitive social communication task platform. This features a Rule Generator that is used to offer tasks based on the composite effect of task performance and estimated anxiety from one's gaze in an individualized manner. Results of a study with 10 individuals with ASD showed that the anxiety-sensitive system showed promise in eliciting improved task performance and increased looking towards the face region of a communicator displaying emotional expression in comparison to the currently existing system that is blind to one's anxiety. This paves the way towards design of a complementary tool for the therapists.

 UI designers often correct false affordances and improve the discoverability of features when users have trouble determining if elements are tappable. We contribute a novel system that models the perceived tappability of mobile UI elements with a vision-based deep neural network and helps provide design insights with dataset-level and instance-level explanations of model predictions. Our system retrieves designs from similar mobile UI examples from our dataset using the latent space of our model. We also contribute a novel use of an interpretability algorithm, XRAI, to generate a heatmap of UI elements that contribute to a given tappability prediction. Through several examples, we show how our system can help automate elements of UI usability analysis and provide insights for designers to iterate their designs. In addition, we share findings from an exploratory evaluation with professional designers to learn how AI-based tools can aid UI design and evaluation for tappability issues.

 The ability to successfully infer private behavioral intentions using publicly-available digital records has a far-reaching impact. Unlike other private attributes such as demographic attributes, an intention oftentimes leads to a near-future behavior. Prior knowledge about such future behaviors can be seen as “actionable intelligence” and constitutes a significantly bigger risk to users’ privacy than knowledge of non-behavioral attributes. In this paper, we present a novel, multidisciplinary methodology for behavioral-intention inference. Using Bayesian-Networks, we model a behavioral intention using a set of causes that influence the intention’s formation, a set of effects that are caused by the intention, and various dependency relations within and between those sets. Unlike the methodologies used in prior attribute-inference works, which are oftentimes tailored to a single target attribute, our methods can be applied to different types of intentions from a diverse set of domains as we demonstrate by applying our model to multiple real-world intention-inference tasks.

 This work presents NERO, a game concept using the player’s active emotional input to map the emotional state of the player to representative in-game characters. Emotional input in games has been mainly used as a passive measure to adjust for game difficulty or other variables. However the player has not been given the possibility to explore and play with one’s emotions as an active feature. Given the high subjectivity of felt emotions we wanted to focus on the player’s experience of emotional input rather than the objective accuracy of the input sensor. We therefore implemented a proof-of-concept game using heart-rate as a proxy for emotion measurement and through repeated player tests the game mechanics were revised and evaluated. Valuable insight for the design of entertainment-focused emotional input games were gained, including emotional connection despite limited accuracy, influence of the environment and the importance of calibration. The players overall enjoyed the novel game experience and their feedback carries useful implications for future games including active emotional input.

 This workshop engages the phenomenon of synesthesia to explore how translating between sensory modalities might uncover new ways to experience and represent data: What does it mean to taste a timeline, hear a network, or touch a categorical scale? We employ the method of sketching, which traditionally favors visual representations, and consider what it means to ‘sketch’ in other modalities like sound, taste, and touch. Through a series of rapid, playful activities ideating data representations across sensory modalities, we will explore how the affordances of sketching—like intentional ambiguity—might help designers creatively map data to experience. We will also discuss challenges for sensory sketching in remote, collaborative environments and brainstorm suggestions for digital tools. The outcome of this workshop will be a series of exercises and examples that serve as a toolkit for designers, researchers, and data practitioners to incorporate sketching across the senses into their work.

 I aim to understand how individuals may be motivated non-financially to collaborate in maintaining evolving information asynchronously. I have developed two systems, Drafty and Sketchy, that provide evidence of achieving this goal at differing timescales. In Drafty, unpaid contributors voluntarily update a tabular dataset of Computer Science professor profiles at a multi-year timescale. In Sketchy, university students simultaneously sketch and co-inspire each other during voluntary UI/UX sketching activities at a sub-hour timescale. I seek to integrate lessons from both systems to develop a theoretical framework that uses a feedback cycle to provide users with practical random examples from evolving information to motivate new contributions. I will further develop this theoretical framework by extending Drafty to generate insights to automatically attract visitors and create the Virtual Readability Lab (VRL) to help users improve their reading performance through personalized readability tests and deepen our understanding of information design human performance. Both systems will give users the agency to seek randomized insights within a naturalistic setting to motivate continuous contributions to each system’s evolving information.

 Augmented reality (AR) has a diverse range of applications, including language teaching. When studying a foreign language, one of the biggest challenges learners face is memorizing new vocabulary. While augmented holograms are a promising means of supporting this memorization process, few studies have explored their potential in the language learning context. We demonstrate the possibility of using flashcard along with an expressive holographic agent on vocabulary learning. Users scan a flashcard and play an animation that is connected with an emotion related to the word they are seeing. Our goal is to propose an alternative to the traditional use of flashcards, and also introduce another way of using AR in the association process.

Many smartwatches are now equipped with front-facing cameras that can detect users’ faces and track the devices’ spatial location relative to the faces in mid-air space. This space can be used as virtual placeholders for user interfaces where users can access them by moving their watch. In this paper, we present a novel face-centered spatial user interface for smartwatches that leverages the mid-air space for augmenting virtual user interfaces. With a pilot study, we first examine the suitable mid-air space that users can access during active use while wearing smartwatches. Next we conduct an online survey investigating users’ attitudes towards using the space to access mid-air user interfaces. More specifically, we focus on the social acceptance of face-centered spatial user interfaces in different locations and in front of different audiences. Results indicate that participants welcomed the idea of face-centered spatial user interfaces, however, the acceptance varied based on where and in front of whom they are using the space.

When the stretch alarm is given, users hold CareMouse and do exercises, and the system collects the wrist movement data and determines whether they follow the accurate stretching motions based on a machine learning algorithm, enabling real-time guidance. We conducted a preliminary user study to understand the users’ perception and user experience of the system. Our results showed the feasibility of CareMouse in guiding stretching exercises interactively. We provided design implications for the augmentation of existing tools when offering auxiliary functions.

Joint media engagement (JME) provides digital interaction and becomes a convenient tool for collaborative storytelling. However, the person perspectives, reusability, and modifiability of the story contents are rarely discussed; also parents may lack the skills of professional story-making. Therefore, we propose an object-oriented three-dimensional (3D) storytelling system, which provides an interactive educational media space for parent-child storytelling. The system supports manipulating reusable character objects and narrating stories from the 1st and 3rd person perspectives in an intuitive manner. Parents can create stories freely based on the background of famous fairy tales and incorporate family education. Our goal is to create a storytelling system for educational entertainment that is fun and conducive to free expression and creativity.

RumorLens: Interactive Analysis and Validation of Suspected Rumors on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519712,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03098,"
With the development of social media, various rumors can be easily spread on the Internet and such rumors can have serious negative effects on society. Thus, it has become a critical task for social media platforms to deal with suspected rumors. However, due to the lack of effective tools, it is often difficult for platform administrators to analyze and validate rumors from a large volume of information on a social media platform efficiently. We have worked closely with social media platform administrators for four months to summarize their requirements of identifying and analyzing rumors, and further proposed an interactive visual analytics system, RumorLens, to help them deal with the rumor efficiently and gain an in-depth understanding of the patterns of rumor spreading. RumorLens integrates natural language processing (NLP) and other data processing techniques with visualization techniques to facilitate interactive analysis and validation of suspected rumors. We propose well-coordinated visualizations to provide users with three levels of details of suspected rumors: an overview displays both spatial distribution and temporal evolution of suspected rumors; a projection view leverages a metaphor-based glyph to represent each suspected rumor and further enable users to gain a quick understanding of their overall characteristics and similarity with each other; a propagation view visualizes the dynamic spreading details of a suspected rumor with a novel circular visualization design, and facilitates interactive analysis and validation of rumors in a compact manner. By using a real-world dataset collected from Sina Weibo, one case study with a domain expert is conducted to evaluate RumorLens. The results demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.

 Text summarization is an example of a complex algorithm with a single direct input to output user operation. As different types of users e.g. students, journalists, etc. adopt these algorithms, it is imperative that user experience with text summarization AI systems is modified to allow agency. To explore this, we designed an interactive multi-document summarization system, called Living Documents, that allows agency over the summarization process. We evaluated this system in a preliminary study with 25 students identified from Prolific. The students perform summarization tasks using the control functions in our system. Results from this study show that these functions contributed to the user’s understanding of how summarization works and this understanding slightly impacts user trust in our system positively. We discuss our experience designing for user control of a normally automated, complex process that produces immutable output and the future implications for other applications.

ParaSight: Enabling Privacy-preserving Sensing Data Sharing via Device-to-device Utterance-based Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519757,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/z44j35zi2vevtjgwxxlnyiutci/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519757,"
Privacy-invasive sensors such as cameras and microphones in smart devices (e.g., Facebook Portal, Google Nest Hub Max, Amazon Echo Show) are now ubiquitous in a user’s private setting, which raises users’ privacy concerns of always listening and monitoring. To address such privacy concerns, we developed ParaSight, a smart speaker add-on device that communicates to users sensing data transfer. ParaSight transmits the information yet speaks out loud what is being transmitted to a smart speaker connected to a server via utterances by leveraging the smart speaker’s ability to understand human languages. Communicating sensing data as utterances brings two benefits: (i) a user can hear and understand what data, and when, are being transferred as utterances are human-understandable; (ii) raw data are processed locally and only filtered signals can be uploaded to a server. ParaSight, for example, can receive and locally process raw data of a user’s audio and video data (e.g., snoring sound, workout video), and only transmit the filtered data to a server. We demonstrate two work-in-progress applications—snoring detection and home training applications—to show ParaSight’s use cases.

Towards Conviviality in NavigatingHealth Information on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517622,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517622,"
 HCI is increasingly concerned with health information quality and spread of misinformation on social media. Despite many major platforms having been adopted across the world, the situated evaluation and sharing of health information is underexplored across diverse health systems and cultural and political contexts. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we study the navigation of health information on social media in urban and rural South India, backdropped by plural knowledges around health and the specific politics and sociality of health and social media in this setting. We use Ivan Illich’s concept of tools for conviviality [49] to distinguish between how people creatively use tools versus how tools manage and impose values on people—participants aimed to use health information towards care beyond institutionalized healthcare, but insidious misinformation and information-sharing practices served to commodify, spark uncertainty in, and discipline caring behavior. We use our findings to expand understandings of the use of health information on social media and how positionality shapes how people are affected by and respond to misinformation. We also draw attention to the structural aspects of health misinformation in the Indian context and how the design of social media platforms might play a role in addressing it.

Conversation-Based Hybrid User Interface for Structured Qualitative Survey: A Pilot Study Using Repertory Grid,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519690,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/qhuk4h3a2bbm5p4sie6alsz3mu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519690,"
 Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) have the potential to substantially influence current practice in diverse application fields, one important example being the way in which online surveys are conducted. Currently, CUIs are mainly applied to help improve the user experience with quantitative surveys. We describe the development of a Hybrid User Interface (HUI) prototype that combines a Graphical User interface (GUI) and a CUI to conduct a fully automated but structured qualitative survey according to the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT). This paper describes a pilot study that we conducted to inform the design of the HUI and to converge to a prototype that is sufficiently mature and robust to be used in a more extensive follow-up study. Our experiences with developing this HUI may help others avoid pitfalls and profit from the tools and lessons we have learned as part of our design process.

Accessing Intimate Interactions: Investigating the need for More Inclusive Sex Education Resources,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519747,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/vdhcgabay5b3no2ifmdc7xeb44/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519747,"
Misconceptions surrounding disability and sexuality are still prevalent and people with disabilities are often depicted as asexual and incapable to lead fulfilling sex lives. As a result, many individuals with disabilities struggle to access adequate sex education with negative consequences such as unplanned pregnancies, body image issues and sexual exploitation. To explore needs and practices for accessing relevant and reliable information about disability and sexuality, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. Results show that there are several topics which participants thought should be better explored in the context of disability and sexuality, but most available sex education resources are not inclusive. Moreover, people with disabilities, especially when young or less used to self-advocate for their own needs, face difficulties engaging in meaningful conversations around sexuality. Based on the results of our research, we make recommendations for areas where HCI research could significantly contribute to make intimate interactions more accessible.

Making Access: Increasing Inclusiveness in Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503696,1,https://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/files/146264810/3491101.3503696.pdf,"
 In this one-day workshop we are going to make access. We aim to counteract the phenomenon that access to making (e.g., in makerspaces, fablabs, etc.) is not equally distributed, with certain groups of people being underrepresented (e.g., women*1). After brief introductions from participants and a set of three impulse keynotes, we will envision and “make” interventions together, such as speculative or provocative objects and actions. The workshop takes a constructive stance with the goal to not rest on empirical and theoretical findings or individual experiences, but to translate those into viable interventions. These serve as exemplars of findings with the clear goal of being deployed soon after.

SignFind: A Synchronized Sign Language and Chinese Character Teaching Game for Chinese Deaf Children Using Gesture Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519697,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/lstc35njjbhj7lh7kz5ln2oavi/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519697,"
This paper presents a targeted system to help Chinese deaf children learn both sign language and Chinese characters in early language learning. The system combines sign recognition and in-air writing techniques with games so that children can practice sign language and Chinese character writing at the same time. Sign recognition is used to assess the accuracy of sign language and in-air writing records the process of writing Chinese characters. In addition, the game adds to the learning fun and makes children more willing to complete learning tasks. We have developed a prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of a simultaneous Chinese sign language and Chinese character teaching system based on gesture recognition and in-air writing. We expect that this system will increase children's willingness and efficiency to learn sign language and Chinese characters, and eventually be used to assist in early language education for deaf children in the Chinese region.

 Research in surgical intervention and technology development is increasingly interdisciplinary. Despite the great potential of working in this way, recent research suggests that interdisciplinary collaborations and competing stakeholder interests can be challenging to initiate and manage, with the result that knowledge and expertise from different fields are not always well integrated. The aim of this workshop is to bring together stakeholders from HCI, surgical science, and surgical practice and technology to investigate the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration, specifically identifying actionable strategies to coordinate and improve efforts towards designing, developing, evaluating, and iterating on the next generation of surgical solutions. The workshop will address current limitations in interdisciplinary collaboration, and identify opportunities for surgical technology stakeholders to make contributions across the entire development life cycle. In the longer term, the workshop will contribute towards the development of a pragmatic collaboration framework encompassing diverse research paradigms, compatible with surgical practice, and supportive of longitudinal evaluation.

Evoker: Narrative-based Facial Expression Game for Emotional Development of Adolescents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516486,0,,"
Evoker is a narrative-based facial expression game. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents should be wearing masks in their daily lives. However, wearing masks disturbs emotional interaction through facial expressions, which is a critical component in emotional development. Therefore, a negative impact on adolescent emotional development is predicted. To solve this problem, we design a narrative-based game Evoker that uses real-time facial expression recognition. In this game, players are asked to identify an emotion from narrative contexts in missions, and make a facial expression appropriate for the context to clear the challenges. Our game provides an opportunity to practice reading emotional contexts and expressing appropriate emotions, which has a high potential for promoting emotional development of adolescents.

“How much connection did you get?” Drinking Journaling Data through Hot Cocoa,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519800,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519800,"
 What if you could get a taste of your own thoughts? We propose a new system in HCI that uses computational tools to map text onto flavors and thus allow users to ”eat their words” in the form of a custom hot cocoa blend created from written journal entries, helping people engage in reflection. Our more open-ended approach to computer-augmented reflection explores new tangible mediums and methods to facilitate a sense of playful fluidity in machine interactions. A deep learning pipeline is developed that finds meaning within user journals by identifying similar poems/stories/texts in a pre-collected corpus. A dispenser outputs a drink mix with flavors based on these discovered meanings, and prints a receipt to help users make sense of their experience. To encourage disclosure and create a reflective mood, we model our experience based on journaling at an intimate cafe. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates strong promise in this approach.

 HCI research often involves accessing and storing information in databases. However, in case of a database node failure, researchers could experience significant work delays, monetary costs, and data loss. How can researchers who have little or no knowledge of systems and infrastructures ensure that their data collection source is reliable and maximally available for accessing and storing data? To answer this question, we surveyed 11 HCI researchers. Using the findings from the survey, we developed Styx++—an easy-to-integrate open-source solution that bundles together existing tools and concepts, providing HCI researchers with a reliable distributed system for their database needs. Styx++ is a hybrid solution involving both the Paxos and Chain Replication Protocol, providing strong consistency and high availability to minimize the risks of single-point failures in a traditional database system setup. Our evaluation of Styx++ against benchmark solutions shows promising results of an increase in reliability without substantial performance degradation.

Cost-effective and Collaborative Methods to Author Video's Scene Description for Blind People.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503814,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/ivtfgbfvrbd2rnhghmdjrayarm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503814,"
 The majority of online video content remains inaccessible for blind people due to the lack of audio descriptions. Content creators have traditionally relied on professionals to author audio descriptions, but their service is costly and not readily available. In this research, I introduce four threads of research that I will conduct for my Ph.D. dissertation, aimed to create methods and tools that are both time- and cost-effective in providing good quality audio descriptions. They are: (i) The development and evaluation of mixed-ability collaboration authoring tool, (ii) The formative study to uncover the feedback pattern from the reviewer, (iii) the evaluation and generation of real-time supports for novice authors to write AD, and (iv) the design, development, and evaluation of a system that demonstrate the utility of semi-automatically authoring AD. I believe these four research threads help me to uncover a cheaper solution to generate audio description. Hence, motivating the content creator to include this accessibility feature in the video production process and making the existing and upcoming videos accessible.

With the development of low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping techniques, as well as widely available mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, smart watches), projects related to the design and fabrication of personal health sensing applications, either on top of existing device platforms (e.g. mHealth), or as stand-alone devices, have emerged in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in novel sensing and interface technologies, accessibility studies and system design open up new possibilities and can bring in different perspectives for personal health sensing. We believe that joining the forces in such interdisciplinary work is a key to moving the field of personal health sensing forward. This Special Interest Group aims to bring in researchers from different fields, identify the significance and challenges of the personal health sensing domain, discuss potential solutions and future research directions, and promote collaborative research opportunities.

"Monitoring pets, deterring intruders, and casually spying on neighbors: Everyday uses of smart home cameras",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517617,20,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3517617,"
The increased adoption of smart home cameras (SHCs) foregrounds issues of surveillance, power, and privacy in homes and neighborhoods. However, questions remain about how people are currently using these devices to monitor and surveil, what the benefits and limitations are for users, and what privacy and security tensions arise between primary users and other stakeholders. We present an empirical study with 14 SHC users to understand how these devices are used and integrated within everyday life. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews, we investigate users’ motivations, practices, privacy concerns, and social negotiations. Our findings highlight the SHC as a perceptually powerful and spatially sensitive device that enables a variety of surveillant uses outside of basic home security—from formally surveilling domestic workers, to casually spying on neighbors, to capturing memories. We categorize surveillant SHC uses, clarify distinctions between primary and non-primary users, and highlight under-considered design directions for addressing power imbalances among primary and non-primary users.

 Social robots can be applied in different settings to enhance experiences for humans. Understanding physical and behavioural aspects of robot design is important to promote acceptance in human-robot interaction. In this study, we focus on robot initiative-taking as a behavioural aspect and investigate how it influences human perception and emotion during human-robot interaction. We built on previous work using questionnaires to evaluate user impressions in the presence or absence of robot activeness (initiative-taking). We also used Galvanic skin response (GSR) as a physiological measure to gauge participants’ emotion during interaction. Questionnaire analysis confirmed that generally active robot behaviour improved human impression. Moreover, the order of interaction seems to matter for participants to take more notice of robot initiative-taking. GSR analysis supported the questionnaire results, showing that on average participants were more emotionally aroused during an active interaction and that order of interaction somewhat mattered.

 Thermal cues in the car can be used as an alternative to audio and vibration feedback to lessen the burden on the often overloaded visual channel. This paper presents an investigation of a heated car seat to evaluate the effectiveness of the heating for feedback purposes. The temperature changes of a heated car seat were measured without and with seated passengers to assess the heating capabilities in general and to understand the temperature interaction with a seated person. A user study (N=12) investigated the recognition times during a simulated driving task. Temperature changes during driving simulation were detected on average in under 1min, with an average increase of around 0.33℃ on the backrest (0.36℃ on seat). These initial results can be used as basis and inspiration for further investigations to lessen the visual channel with thermal cues.

“A Second Voice”: Investigating Opportunities and Challenges for Interactive Voice Assistants to Support Home Health Aides,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517683,1,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10347428,"
Home health aides are a vulnerable group of frontline caregivers who provide personal and medically-oriented care in patients’ homes. Their work is difficult and unpredictable, involving a mix of physical and emotional labor as they adapt to patients’ changing needs. Our paper presents an exploratory, qualitative study with 32 participants, that investigates design opportunities for Interactive Voice Assistants (IVAs) to support aides’ essential care work. We explore challenges and opportunities for IVAs to (1) fill gaps in aides’ access to information and care coordination, (2) assist with decision making and task completion, (3) advocate on behalf of aides, and (4) provide emotional support. We then discuss key implications of our work, including how materiality may impact perceived ownership and usage of IVAs, the need to carefully consider tensions around surveillance, accountability, data collection, and reporting, and the challenges of centering aides as essential workers in complex home health care contexts.

 We describe how sheets of metalized mylar can be cut and then “inflated” into complex 3D forms with electrostatic charge for use in digitally-controlled, shape-changing displays. This is achieved by placing and nesting various cuts, slits and holes such that mylar elements repel from one another to reach an equilibrium state. Importantly, our technique is compatible with industrial and hobbyist cutting processes, from die and laser cutting to handheld exacto-knives and scissors. Given that mylar film costs <$1 per m2, we can create self-actuating 3D objects for just a few cents, opening new uses in low-cost consumer goods. We describe a design vocabulary, interactive simulation tool, fabrication guide, and proof-of-concept electrostatic actuation hardware. We detail our technique’s performance metrics along with qualitative feedback from a design study. We present numerous examples generated using our pipeline to illustrate the rich creative potential of our method.

 Humans are unique in working collaboratively by sharing and understanding intentions. However, digital collaboration is daunting, especially in creative design life cycles, due to non-linear workflows and lack of micro-alignments coupled with the need for robust network connectivity. We present a formative study with creatives to identify key themes in conflicts that arise in this space. We introduce CollabColor, a user interface that aids in resolving conflicts for two users synchronously collaborating on a low-touch creative task. More specifically, given an uncolored line-art on a canvas and a set of reference images from the users as input, we arrive at design goals for an intelligent system that can enhance our interface. We find that such a system must provide non-obtrusive interventions during real-time collaboration to ensure that the final colorization of the art is coherent, and all the users’ aligned preferences are incorporated.

Acu. ation: Real Time Acupoint Stimulation To Mediate The Urge To Smoke.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519636,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/146141/3491101.3519636.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
Acu.ation is an intervention that aims to mediate the urge to smoke by pairing a wearable device that delivers transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) with a mobile application that provides Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP)(Figure 1). Given the pervasiveness of cigarette smoking, high rates of relapse, and limitations of existing treatments, it is critical to explore new methods of relapse prevention. Our solution draws from acupuncture's global use in treating addiction and recent evidence that non-invasive TEAS can reduce the urge to smoke after exposure to a drug-related cue. Specifically, we have designed a device formed to four acupoints (LI4, PC8, PC6, and TH5) located on the wrist and hand, and programmed to deliver 5-15mA stimulation. Through a paired mobile application, individuals are simultaneously guided through an MBRP intervention to help them take control of their response to the trigger. Together, this system provides real-time relief from the urge to smoke so individuals can better engage with cognitive behavioral relapse prevention strategies in high risk moments.

Co-Designing an Experience Sampling Method Digital Platform to Investigate Self-Harm Among Young People,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519861,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/aegqws4x5zeo3jxkaiqhb3qjse/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519861,"
Self-harm is particularly prevalent amongst young people, with adverse consequences in terms of later wellbeing, vocational outcomes, and increased risk of suicide. Although many studies have explored self-harm, it remains difficult to predict and prevent, in part because the mental states that typically precede self-harm are highly variable and triggers can be unclear. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM), where participants are asked to record personal data many times during the day, allows researchers to capture these variable mental states and their relation to self-harming behaviour. We conducted a series of co-design workshops involving young people with lived experience of self-harm and researchers with a special interest in ESM to identify the requirements of both groups for an ESM digital platform for investigating self-harm. We describe their key requirements, some of which are conflicting, and suggest ways that these could be addressed to develop an effective ESM platform.

We demonstrate a novel interface concept in which interactive systems directly manipulate the user's head orientation. We implement this using electrical-muscle-stimulation (EMS) of the neck muscles, which turns the head around its yaw (left/right) and pitch (up/down) axis. As the first exploration of EMS for head actuation, we characterized which muscles can be robustly actuated. Then, we demonstrated how it enables interactions not possible before by building a range of applications, such as (1) directly changing the user's head orientation to locate objects in AR; (2) a sound controller that uses neck movements as both input and output; (3) synchronizing head orientations of two users, which enables a user to communicate head nods to another user while listening to music; and (4) rendering force feedback from VR punches on the head by actuating the user's neck.

"Personas: New Data, New Trends",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503772,0,,"
Personas has evolved since Alan Cooper coined the term in 1999, moving into new domains, new ways of collecting data, and with novel ways of presenting the persona profiles. From the beginning, personas was linked to software design, expressing the need for empathy with end-users. This is still the case today, but we want to show how this is executed in different domains, not only in software, and how different forms of presentation relate to empathy. Thus, the persona course investigates the relationship between data collection, the representation of data as persona profiles, and empathy.

 Now more than ever, people are using online platforms to communicate. Twitch, the foremost platform for live game streaming, offers many communication modalities. However, the platform lacks representation of social cues and signals of the audience experience, which are innately present in live events. For this demonstration, we present an interactive experience that captures the audience energy and response in a game streaming context. We designed a survival shooter game and integrated a custom-communication modality (Commons Sense) in which remote audience attendees’ heart rates will be sensed via webcam, averaged, and fed into a video game as input to affect sound, lighting, and difficulty.

Classy Trash Monster: An Educational Game for Teaching Machine Learning to Non-major Students,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3516487,0,,"
 As machine learning (ML) became more relevant to our lives, ML education for college students without technical background arose important. However, not many educational games designed to suit challenges they experience exist. We introduce an educational game Classy Trash Monster (CTM), designed to better educate ML and data dependency to non-major students who learn ML for the first time. The player can easily learn to train a classification model and solve tasks by engaging in simple game activities designed according to an ML pipeline. Simple controls, positive rewards, and clear audiovisual feedback makes game easy to play even for novice players. The playtest result showed that players were able to learn basic ML concepts and how data can impact model results, and that the game made ML feel less difficult and more relevant. However, proper debriefing session seems crucial to prevent misinterpretations that may occur in the learning process.

 We demonstrate a mobile text entry system that brings full-size ten-finger typing to everyday surfaces, allowing users to type anywhere. Our wearable wristband TapType integrates accelerometers that sense vibrations arising from finger taps against a passive surface, from which our Bayesian neural network estimates a probability distribution over the fingers of the hand. Given a pre-defined key-finger mapping, our text entry decoder fuses these predictions with the character priors of an n-gram language model to decode the input text entered by the user. TapType combines high portability with sustained rapid bimanual input across the full space, which we demonstrate at the example of supplementing text input on mobile touch devices, in eyes-free scenarios using audio feedback, and in a situated Mixed Reality scenario to enable typing outside visual control with passive haptic feedback.

In iterative physical object creation, only the latest design state is manifested in the physical artifact, while information about previous versions are lost. This makes it challenging to keep track of changes and developments in iterative physical design. In this paper, we propose the concept of Tangible Version Control (TVC), inspired by the visualizations of traditional version control systems. In TVC, the real-world artifact itself is used for exploring its alternative versions in physical space, while comparisons to an alternative version are displayed seamlessly on the artifact with the use of augmented reality. Our implementation of TVC includes three different comparison modes, namely SideBySide, Overlay, and Differences. Furthermore, we discuss the anticipated use, opportunities, and challenges of using TVC in the future for individual users as well as for asynchronous collaborative work.

Conditions associated with climate change, such as sea level rise and increasing extreme weather events, can destabilize already vulnerable network and digital infrastructures. While existing infrastructures are in dire need of maintenance, additional infrastructures are simultaneously being built to address imbalances in network access and distribution. My dissertation project attends to these intersecting precarities as a way to reconsider how digital infrastructures can be reworked to address overlapping questions of environmental and digital inequities. My research is situated within marginalized coastal communities in south Louisiana, where legacies of petrochemical extraction has led to deep socioeconomic and ecological disparities, while increased intensity of storms and floods have begun to impede and damage an already sparse network infrastructure. In my project, I use archival, ethnographic, and design research methods to examine longer histories of environmental degradation, investigate current practices of maintaining and developing network infrastructures, and develop approaches for researchers in HCI and related computing fields to re-envision just and equitable network infrastructures.

PriCheck–An Online Privacy Assistant for Smart Device Purchases,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519827,0,https://www.unibw.de/usable-security-and-privacy/publikationen/pdf/volk2022chiea_authorversion.pdf,"
 In this paper, we present PriCheck, a browser extension that provides privacy-relevant information about smart devices (e.g., in an online shop). This information is oftentimes hidden, difficult to access, and, thus, often neglected when buying a new device. With PriCheck, we enable users to make informed purchase decisions. We conducted an exploratory study using the browser extension in a simplified (mock) online shop for smart devices. Participants chose devices with and without using the extension. We found that participants (N = 11) appreciated the usability and available information of PriCheck, helping them with informed decisions for privacy-preserving products. We hope our work will stimulate further discussion on how to make privacy information for novel products available, understandable, and easy to access for users.

Interaction Design for VR Applications: Understanding Needs for University Curricula,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519859,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04386,"
As virtual reality (VR) is emerging in the tech sector, developers and designers are under pressure to create immersive experiences for their products. However, the current curricula from top institutions focus primarily on technical considerations for building VR applications, missing out on concerns and usability problems specific to VR interaction design. To better understand current needs, we examined the status quo of existing university pedagogies by carrying out a content analysis of undergraduate and graduate courses about VR and related areas offered in the major citadels of learning and conducting interviews with 7 industry experts. Our analysis reveals that the current teaching practices underemphasize design thinking, prototyping, and evaluation skills, while focusing on technical implementation. We recommend VR curricula should emphasize design principles and guidelines, offer training in prototyping and ideation, prioritize practical design exercises while providing industry insights, and encourage students to solve VR design problems beyond the classroom.

 Most literature has already shown that virtual reality, concretely, 360-degrees video can have influence on affective skills in multiple applications from education to medicine. This thesis aims to go one step further, real-time 360-degree video communications. Researchers commonly based their experiments on controlled environments and participants with specific characteristics which reduce the reproducibility and ecological validity of the methodologies. We propose to design a methodology based on questionnaires and the use of biosensors to jointly assess technical and socioemotional features in bidirectional immersive communications. For that, we first present some research questions and then choose the tools, stimuli, and use case to answer them. The use case selected as starting point to validate the methodology is tele-education. This thesis is an invitation to leave the comfort zone and question the usage of methodologies that have been highly proven with previous technologies, but which may as well be insufficient to address the challenges of new communications.

A Case Study on Improving Accessibility of Healthcare Care Facility in Low-resource Settings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503557,0,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10152533/1/A%20Case%20Study%20on%20Improving%20Accessibility%20of%20Healthcare%20Care%20Facility%20in%20Low-resource%20Settings.pdf,"
 Accessibility in a hospital is challenging for people in low-income countries due to a lack of accessible mediums to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information. This results in delays and stress but can also result in sub-optimal treatment or sometimes a complete lack of treatment for the visitors. Sensible physical and digital interventions can greatly ease the experience of visitors and reduce the work-related stress of healthcare providers. We present a case study on wayfinding and service design for a mega ophthalmic care facility that has a daily footfall of 2500 patients. From our mixed-methods study we identified: (i) there are very few accessible mediums available to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information; (ii) there is a lack of inclusively designed interventions to accommodate the diversity of visitors; (iii) spatial ambiguity and situational impairment due to crowd density exasperate the situation and (iv) there exist missing as well as misleading information. We developed a spectrum of solutions on the environmental and digital infrastructures available within this context to deliver wayfinding and procedural information. We completed a progressive intervention across digital and physical mediums over a duration of 18 months. This has shown the impact of each medium on visitors’ experience. We found the choice of interface to access information depends on the ease of access, and ease of access depends on visitors’ abilities. Therefore, both the environment and digital mediums are found to be useful for visitors. Based on these empirical findings, we draw recommendations for an inclusive service design that incorporates using elements of the environment, human and digital infrastructure to support a more positive healthcare visitors experience.

 Gameplay spectatorship has developed significantly over the last decade, necessitating the need to design more engaging spectator experiences. In order to do this effectively, however, we must first better understand spectator behavior and motivations. In this paper, we build on the results of a previous work examining interaction preferences of remote livestream spectators depending on their user type, and report a new qualitative study exploring the underlying motivations that shape the experience of those engaged in interactive spectating. Our results highlight five main themes (entertainment, team support, learning, caster, social) that motivate spectators to engage with interactive esports experiences. This work will motivate ongoing research in this domain by promoting conversations about livestream spectator engagement and motivations, and facilitating engaging spectator experiences.

 Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. For example, studies have shown that autistic children are receptive to SARs in therapy, and achieve similar learning outcomes compared to human-delivered therapy. Given the sensitive nature of therapy and the current state of autonomous robots, however, SARs are in practice teleoperated by a therapist who controls their motion and dialogue. This presents an opportunity to produce more effective SAR teleoperation interfaces in the context of therapy for autistic children. In this paper, I outline research for improving teleoperation interfaces of SARs through (1) analyzing current teleoperation usage, (2) interviewing teleoperators about their needs, and (3) implementing and evaluating varied designs for teleoperation interfaces.

Our everyday digital tasks require access to information from a wide range of applications and systems. Although traditional search systems can help find information, they usually operate within one application (e.g., email client or web browser) and require the user’s cognitive effort and attention to formulate proper search queries. In this paper, we demonstrate EntityBot, a system that proactively provides useful and supporting entities across application boundaries without requiring explicit query formulation. Our methodology is to exploit the context from screen frames captured every 2 seconds to recommend relevant entities for the current task. Recommendations are not restricted to only documents but include various kinds of entities, such as applications, documents, contact persons, and keywords representing the tasks. Recommendations are actionable, that is, a user can perform actions on recommended entities, such as opening documents and applications. The EntityBot also includes support for interactivity, allowing the user to affect the recommendations by providing explicit feedback on the entities. The usefulness of entity recommendations and their impact on user behavior has been evaluated in a user study based on real-world tasks. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the system had an actual impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.

Combining Spatial and Non-Spatial Sonification for Sound Localization in Virtual Environment: a Subjective Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519853,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/m4ewpfde6faa7hkkonppgtz65y/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519853,"
 Spatially sonified audio is frequently used in virtual environments to serve as an object localization cue. However, spatializers that are available to the general public typically have their limitations and lead to sound localization errors. By combining it with non-spatial sonification, the technique of encoding information with perceptual attributes of the sound, the localization errors of spatially sonified audio could be reduced. However, the encoded information would require higher mental effort to understand, which could be a concern under high task load. In this paper, we conducted a subjective study to compare spatial sonification against combined auditory cue using spatial and non-spatial sonification for target localization. We tested both methods under low and high task load. Our results show that combined sonification could significantly reduce the errors in localizaiton, but the advantage would be influenced by higher task load. Further, we compared several different non-spatial sonification methods for encoding depth information. Our experiment shows that both pitch and pulse frequency modulation are feasible for presenting depth of the target. Our results could contribute as a first step to a general guideline of designing sonification method as target localization cue.

Increasing the Acceptance of Industrial Robots by Adapting Movement Behavior to Individual User Differences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503812,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/l7i2laqtybbatil47cyepnx4zm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503812,"
 Machines, computers, and robots play an increasingly important role in our personal and professional lives. In manufacturing industries, the direct physical collaboration between workers and robots is already reality today. To understand how humans perceive this collaboration, investigations regarding the effect of different robot behaviors and the characteristics that influence the perception by humans are required. Existing findings on the effect of human attributes and human-like appearance of robots point out several possibilities that improve interactions between humans and robots. However, these studies predominantly focus on humanoid robots. With regard to the increasing number of industrial robots and the arising economic potential of automation, the objective of my research is to gain in-depth understanding of human perception of robot movement behaviors. Achieving this requires insights on possible and perceptible robot behaviors in the non-humanoid field, how they are perceived and how they can be mapped to acceptance by humans. Based on this understanding, resulting interactions can be improved by adapting relevant behavior to the individual’s preferences. In view of new technologies and possibilities, it might even be possible to use real time data to classify humans and let robots adapt their behavior automatically.

While users often share accounts with others, currently most accounts support only single user interactions. Within industry, Netflix and Disney+ providing profiles within accounts are testaments to popular services identifying and responding to user needs in this context but the solutions here are mostly naïve. Within academia, while sharing practices are of interest, the practicalities of dealing with them are yet to be studied. This paper highlights said gap in research and reports the preliminary findings of 4 user focus groups that reveal practical challenges and future expectations around the experience of sharing, social implications and user privacy, which when accounted for would support users in their sharing interactions. We intend to extend these findings by integrating them with expert interviews with ‘makers’ who research and work on said technologies, to produce a holistic set of design recommendations that form a practical guide for support around account sharing.

 Comparing products, features, brands, or ideas relative to one another is a common goal in user experience (UX) and market research. While Likert-type scales and ordinal stack ranks are often employed as prioritization methods, they are subject to several psychometric shortcomings. We introduce the numeric forced rank, a lightweight approach that overcomes some of the limitations of standard methods and allows researchers to collect absolute ratings, relative preferences, and subjective comments using a single scale. The approach is optimal for UX and market research, but is also easily employed as a structured decision-making exercise outside of consumer research. We describe how the numeric forced rank was used to determine the name of a new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) feature, present the findings, and make recommendations for future research.

Understanding and Designing for Accessibility in Audio Production among People with Vision Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503806,0,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10346429,"
Specialized software tools have become essential to many forms of content creation, yet poor accessibility of these tools has led to unequitable opportunities for disabled content creators. My doctoral research contributes to our knowledge of accessibility in computer-supported content creation by studying the context of audio production by people with vision impairments. Through interviews, observations, and content analysis, I develop a comprehensive understanding of how accessibility unfolds during various stages of audio content production for blind audio producers – from learning the tools and practices to developing and exhibiting professional expertise while also pushing back against ableist productivity standards and stereotypes. Critically reflecting upon these insights, I am developing a system to scaffold accessible learning of audio production software in a way that recognizes and leverages the expertise and practices developed by blind audio production trainers. The final phase of my dissertation will evaluate this system with both blind trainers and learners to understand how interactive technologies can promote accessible learning in computer-supported content creation.

 Due to public concerns over touch-based disease transmission, tangible and embedded interfaces are perhaps the most unsuited technology during a pandemic. Even so, this case study documents the development and evaluation of such a system from early 2020 when people were told to avoid actions that might spread the virus (e.g., touch). Adding to the challenge, the Lookout was installed outside in a city centre for widespread public use. Despite these challenges, a COVID-safe touchable device was embedded and extensively used. This Case Study reports the co-creation of the device noting COVID restriction adaptations over a nine-month deployment. Our contributions are twofold: the study acts as a case-point of the impact of the unique COVID design context, with lessons for future pandemic scenarios; and, given we had over 10,000 users at a time when people were cautious about using shared devices or services, we surface some design characteristics that can promote the use of public technology.

The Melody of Mysterious Stones is a VR meditation game that utilizes spatial audio technologies. One of the most common mindfulness exercises is to notice and observe five senses including the sense of sound. As a way of helping the players with focusing on their sense of sound, the Melody of Mysterious Stones makes use of spatialized sounds as game elements. Our play tests showed that game players enjoyed playing missions with spatial audio elements. Also, they reported that spatial audio helped them with focusing on their sense of sound and therefore felt more engaged in meditation materials.

 In this paper, we present ChromoPrint, a method which leverages photochromic dyes to convert resin-based 3D printing - a process that traditionally prints objects from a single material and therefore only a single color - into a multi-color 3D printing process. Rather than using a standard single-color resin, our resin contains a mixture of photochromic dyes that can transition into different colors when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. We modify an existing resin printer to incorporate an RGB projection system which can control each of the photochromic dyes in the resin during printing. By saturating the dyes with a UV light prior to mixing into the resin, and then projecting combinations of RGB light onto each layer after it has been UV cured, we can color objects directly during the printing process. We discuss the formulation of the photochromic resin, the modifications to the printer, the user interface that allows a user to apply color to a 3D model, and the software pipeline that outputs the build instructions to the 3D printer, including the exposure times for curing with UV light and for coloring with the RGB projector.

 As COVID-19 spreads across the globe and the number of deaths continues to rise, the heartbreaking experiences are being replaced by collective mourning. As German journalist and pacifist Kurt Tukholsky once said: “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”.  When we look back at the help-seeking posts of those who were lost, those who died of unconfirmed COVID-19 testing reports; those who committed suicide out of despair; those whose life-saving medical equipment were being taken away and those who lost their lives due to overwork and infection from their patients... Many of them were not included in the official statistics, and they are likely to be forgotten over time. They were not being treated fairly when they were alive, and they were not being mentioned after they passed away.  We spoke to one of those families. One daughter said: “After this pandemic, who will remember someone such as my mother – she had nowhere to go for medical treatment; she was rejected by the hospital, and she had to die at home?”  This is one of the reasons why we built this online platform. We want to document as many people who have left us because of the pandemic as possible. Our website also includes the help-seeking information these people posted before they passed away. These are the evidences they have left in a particular moment in this pandemic. We hope to provide a space for family members to express their grief and for the public to mourn the dead. Behind every number is a life.  ”Unfinished Farewell” can be viewed at www.farewell.care and www.jiabaoli.org/covid19

Developing Intentional Relationships with Technologies: Exploring Players' Tension between Play and Non-play and Designing Built-in Interventions to Contribute to …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503815,0,,"
 The dark side of technology, such as technology overuse, has received growing concern. Prior studies have developed a variety of stand-alone techniques to support technology non-use, but few have attempted to build interventions directly into technologies to regulate usage. My research seeks to address this issue in the context of games by exploring the relationship players intend to have with games, especially their desired balance between play and non-play, and designing built-in interventions in games to help support this relationship. I will conduct qualitative interviews to understand players’ ideal relationships with games, and quantitative experiments to investigate the impact of built-in interventions on such relationships. Through these investigations, I attempt to develop a theoretical framework to understand users’ intended relationship with technologies and provide guidance on intervention designs that contribute to digital well-being.

In our evaluation of the B2B e-commerce site of a global manufacturing company we conducted a user test with employees and customers. We found statistically significant differences in usability, user experience and NPS metrics between employees and customers, with the employees being more critical compared to the customers. We postulate and present some evidence that this difference is due to employees implicitly comparing B2B with B2C e-commerce sites and therefore expecting the experience of a B2C site for a B2B site. Such a comparison, fosters a bias, which has implications for businesses that host B2B e-commerce sites. We conclude by sketching recommendations for practitioners on how to go about such a bias.

Lessons Learned Building Low-Cost DIY Tactile Graphics and Conducting a Tactile Drawing Club in Colombia During COVID-19,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503559,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/26uxngwqkrbmdjp4mewfemcvae/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503559,"
 Perceiving images and drawing are fundamental parts of human life, and thus access to them should be a universal right. However, there is a large breach for people with visual impairments to access diverse graphics, let alone drawing. There are several techniques of tactile graphics, such as swell paper, Braille embossing, and thermoform that help to alleviate this gap. However, in developing countries, the high cost and lack of access make them impractical. In this work, we describe our experience improving access to tactile graphics and drawing in Colombia. We created low-cost, effective and efficient, tactile graphics and drawing techniques that improve on current solutions. These techniques were created from the best practices of two projects adapting pieces from the Colombian art heritage [52, 53] for blind and visually impaired people. They were then applied to a third project: running a virtual tactile drawing club with blind and visually impaired participants in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned from these experiences are presented in this paper with the hope they can help the community democratize access to tactile graphics.

How do Users Expect their Smart Memory Vaults to Utilize Their Shared Memories?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519826,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/p6urjeoynzhuraixwvskos5lga/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519826,"
Social media (SM) is a popular accessible form of smart memory vaults. Prior work shows that users are still unable to understand how their shared memories are used by smart systems to create Smart Interactions involving Personal Memories (SIPMs). This can lead to negative social repercussions such as cyberbullying. This work investigates the most memorable SIPMs on Facebook for Egyptian users and their impact on platform usage. We conducted an online survey (N=53) requesting critical incident reports about surprising Facebook SIPMs. The most remembered SIPMs were: customizing advertisements, cuing offline interactions, sharing data with third parties and personalizing the newsfeed. Our results suggest that SIPMs, particularly customized advertisements act as ambient memory augmentation solutions to the users’ shared memories. Additionally, negative platform perception does not necessarily translate into reduction of platform usage. Our work inspires the discussion about users expectations towards ambient usage of their data on smart memory vaults.

 Lecture videos have become a prevalent learning resource, due to the rising popularity of educational video platforms and the necessity for remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, lecture videos limit feasible pedagogical approaches, since there are no interactions that students would engage with and learn from in synchronous classes. In this study, we proposed virtual peers - virtual TAs and students that interact with each other as though they are watching the video for the first time together - to help real students learn from observing their interactions. We conducted two rounds of interviews and participatory designs with instructors and TAs to design an authoring tool that would help them create engaging virtual characters and author five types of pedagogically valuable interactions. The design received favorable preliminary feedback from instructors. They expect the tool to add valuable components that are missing from lecture videos with minimal additional effort on their parts.

In-product feedback mechanisms allow for capturing user feedback while the user is engaging with the product or service. Traditionally in-product feedback has focused on metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) [21] and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) [5] which look to measure customer loyalty or overall product satisfaction. By introducing complementary user experience (UX) metrics that are focused on user outcomes, UX teams have greater insight into measuring the successes or challenges of their users in the context of use. This case study describes and discusses the process employed and the lessons learned while designing and implementing a user-centered in-product feedback system. We specifically call out challenges and opportunities around aligning with business outcomes, navigating current frameworks, unlocking self-serve data to stakeholders, informing strategy, and feeding additional research. In conclusion, we present these learnings as a framework, dubbed BLUE, to help other UX teams create in-product feedback mechanisms.

Recent HCI research has suggested a move from individualistic models of digital care and wellbeing to considering the family unit as a locus of support in this area; however, little work has examined the complex, granular everyday experience of such relationships, and the role of gender, class, and care is underexplored. This study focuses on women's familial relationships through interviews with 6 Irish women about their relationships with their mothers, as well as ways in which they maintain the care of themselves and others within these relationships. Our thematic analysis of this data generated four themes: self-other care, leaky boundaries, changes over the lifecourse, and space and conflict – from which we ideated a series of design concepts, six of which are presented here with critiques from our participants. From this exploratory work, we delineate four directions for future HCI research into women's close relationships.

Towards Supporting Intraoperative Coordination and Entrustment in Surgical Faculty-Resident Dyads: Looking Together≠ Seeing the Same Thing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519791,0,https://xinyuechen-flora.github.io/chi22-lbw-jva.pdf,"
 Laparoscopic surgeries require a high degree of visuo-spatial coordination between attending and resident surgeons. The challenge is intensified when surgeons communicate verbally using visual cues. Most prior work in the space supports attending surgeons to give clearer instructions to residents. However, in order to achieve intraoperative success, shared understanding, coordination and trust between faculty-resident dyads is essential. Our work focuses on unpacking both attending and resident surgeons’ experiences during intraoperative operations. We perform an interview study with 6 attending and 3 resident surgeons, in which we ask participants to share their thoughts on the utility and feasibility of capturing surgical dyads’ joint visual attention (JVA) during live surgeries. We find that attending and resident surgeons have contrasting and complementary views about autonomy, communication and coordination during surgeries. We also see positive attitudes towards capturing surgeons’ visual attention during live surgeries and using the data to support communication, coordination and instruction.

LoFi Sketch: A Large Scale Dataset of Smartphone Low Fidelity Sketches,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519624,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/dhvdkbhemrb2bmafh3ouxjpvgm/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519624,"
 Recent research on automating the transformation of low fidelity (LoFi) sketches to code using Deep Neural Networks require a large-scale dataset for generalizable results. This paper introduces the LoFi sketch dataset, an open-access dataset of hand-drawn smartphone LoFi sketches, to facilitate this research domain. It contains 4,527 LoFi sketches annotated with 21 categories of UI elements. Through annotations, it provides the category, position, and location of 41,560 constituent UI elements. We collected these sketches from 361 participants from 76 countries through questionnaires and by acquiring premade LoFi sketches to ensure the dataset’s diversity and ecological validity. These sketches were drawn using pen, pencil, mouse, touch, and stylus as the input medium and available in raster and vector format. This dataset enables further research on several avenues of AI assistance in UI design, such as UI element detection, sketch completion, UI layout refinement, and Sketch-based image retrieval.

On the Impact of Competitive Gameplay on Text Entry Performance-A Study Based on a Mobile Typing Game,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519641,0,https://deco.inso.tuwien.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/wimmer2022typeclash.pdf,"
 Text entry is a fundamental part of human computer interaction and typing games are a popular way to train and improve text entry skills. To assess the impact of competitive gameplay on text entry performance we conducted a public app store trial. For this purpose TypeClash, a competitive multiplayer mobile typing game was designed, developed and publicly distributed. The results demonstrate a significant effect of competitive gameplay mechanics on text entry performance regarding both speed and accuracy, with competitive gameplay resulting in better text entry performance.

AR Magic Lantern: Group-based Co-Located Augmentation Based on the World-as-Support AR Paradigm,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519918,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/rwllqjxflnfcdefpmlmi6xe6fu/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519918,"
 We present the AR Magic Lantern, an augmented reality flashlight that enables its holders to see and interact with situated virtual content that it projects onto the physical surfaces around them. The AR Magic Lantern tracks its position and orientation, so the projected content is truly a part of the physical space and is thus relevant for all members of a group. This makes it especially suitable for implementations of the World-as-Support AR paradigm, where augmented experiences should be shared and situated. We contribute the design principles and methodology used in the development of the hardware and software of the AR Magic Lantern. We also describe the interactive AR experience that we developed for a local cultural heritage site and which will be demoed during CHI 2022.

Photography Community Codesign (aka Codesign in a Global Pandemic),https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3503573,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/wd4ah5hmofgkpguhcs7tgw7w2q/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3503573,"
 Codesign brings together users and creators of a product to collaboratively determine how that product will manifest. In this case study of codesign, the Adobe Lightroom team collaborated with 12 photographers in a 4-day workshop to envision an in-app community space for photographic expression and learning. We discuss findings from the codesign workshop, including core values for the envisioned photography community: authenticity, connection and growth, and how we translated these themes to the design of the product. This case study demonstrates a successful codesign effort within the context of user-centered design at a large company.

Demonstrating FoolProofJoint: Reducing Assembly Errors of Laser Cut 3D Models by Means of Custom Joint Patterns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519881,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/zeb57zo76vg3lahehjxfp66ljy/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3519881,"
We demonstrate FoolProofJoint, a software tool that simplifies the assembly of laser-cut 3D models and reduces the risk of erroneous assembly. FoolProofJoint achieves this by modifying finger joint patterns. Wherever possible, FoolProofJoint makes similar looking pieces fully interchangeable, thereby speeding up the user's visual search for a matching piece. When that is not possible, FoolProofJoint gives finger joints a unique pattern of individual finger placements so as to fit only with the correct piece, thereby preventing erroneous assembly.

Demonstrating ReCompFig: Designing Dynamically Reconfigurable Kinematic Devices Using Compliant Mechanisms and Tensioning Cables,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519890,0,,"
From creating input devices to rendering tangible information, the field of HCI is interested in using kinematic mechanisms to create human-computer interfaces. Yet, due to fabrication and design challenges, it is often difficult to create kinematic devices that are compact and have multiple reconfigurable motional degrees of freedom (DOFs) depending on the interaction scenarios. In this work, we combine compliant mechanisms (CMs) with tensioning cables to create dynamically reconfigurable kinematic mechanisms. The devices’ kinematics (DOFs) is enabled and determined by the layout of bendable rods. The additional cables function as on-demand motion constraints that can dynamically lock or unlock the mechanism's DOFs as they are tightened or loosened. We provide algorithms and a design tool prototype to help users design such kinematic devices. We also demonstrate various HCI use cases including a kinematic haptic display, a haptic proxy, and a multimodal input device.

GAN'SDA Wrap: Geographic And Network Structured DAta on surfaces that Wrap around,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501928,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10845,"
 There are many methods for projecting spherical maps onto the plane. Interactive versions of these projections allow the user to centre the region of interest. However, the effects of such interaction have not previously been evaluated. In a study with 120 participants we find interaction provides significantly more accurate area, direction and distance estimation in such projections. The surface of 3D sphere and torus topologies provides a continuous surface for uninterrupted network layout. But how best to project spherical network layouts to 2D screens has not been studied, nor have such spherical network projections been compared to torus projections. Using the most successful interactive sphere projections from our first study, we compare spherical, standard and toroidal layouts of networks for cluster and path following tasks with 96 participants, finding benefits for both spherical and toroidal layouts over standard network layouts in terms of accuracy for cluster understanding tasks.

Crossing Data: Building Bridges with Activist and Academic Practices from and for Latin America (Cruzar datos: Tendiendo Puentes con Prácticas Activistas y …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3505222,0,https://scholar.archive.org/work/lpsiyku6dve7tnelwynduzkuqe/access/wayback/https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491101.3505222,"
This workshop proposes a space for Latin American academics and activists engaging with data to think critically about the legitimacy and power dynamics of knowledge production. Given that most research on data, as well as its area of application, have focused on and is informed by the Global North, this workshop sets the spotlight on Latin America and places activist and academic knowledge on equal standing. The organisers are an interdisciplinary group of Latin American scholars and activists, women based in the North and the South, engaging with data across the borderlands of disciplines, practices, migrations, and languages. By hosting the workshop in Spanish (with English interpretation), the organisers aim to create a space where Latin American voices are heard and appreciated, without requiring English proficiency from speakers and participants. We invite the CHI community to cross the borders and join a different conversation, including panels and interactive sessions that will inspire — and challenge — current thinking around data and data practices.  Spanish Version: Este taller propone un espacio para que académicxs y activistas latinoamericanxs que trabajan con datos piensen críticamente en la legitimidad y las dinámicas de poder en la producción de conocimiento. Dado que la mayor parte de las investigaciones sobre datos, así como su área de aplicación, se ha centrado en el Norte Global y ha sido moldeada por éste, este taller pone el foco en América Latina y sitúa el conocimiento activista y académico en igualdad de condiciones. Las organizadoras son un grupo interdisciplinario de académicas y activistas latinoamericanas, con sede en el Norte y en el Sur, que trabajan con datos a través de las fronteras disciplinarias, las prácticas, las migraciones y los idiomas. Al organizar el taller en español (con interpretación en inglés), las organizadoras se proponen crear un espacio en el que se escuchen y aprecien las voces latinoamericanas, sin exigir a ponentes y participantes que dominen el inglés. Invitamos a la comunidad de CHI a cruzar las fronteras y unirse a una conversación diferente, incluyendo paneles y sesiones interactivas que inspirarán  — y desafiarán —  ideas en torno a los datos y las prácticas de datos.
