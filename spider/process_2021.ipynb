      "Competitive VR gaming has emerged as a new trend in recent years, due to the availability of consumer grade VR technologies and the rise of esports as a billion dollar industry. Despite the considerable attention to competitive VR gaming, there is a lack of research on attitudes and experiences that players have with these games. In this qualitative study with a pre-post interview design, we recruited eight competitive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players from a university esports club. We aimed to understand their attitudes towards VR esports and their experiences playing a representative location based VR esports game. Findings showed that players had visceral and positive affective experiences in the game, such as how players map physical movements to the game. These findings can help design future competitive VR esports, while also further contributing to HCI as the first exploration on player experiences with VR esports, laying groundwork for future studies. \n",

      " To quickly and accurately measure psychological well-being has been a challenging task. Traditionally, this is done with self-report surveys, which can be time-consuming and burdensome. In this work, we demonstrate the use of short voice recordings on smartphones to automatically predict well-being. In a 5-day study, 35 participants used their smartphones to make short voice recordings of what they were doing throughout the day. Using these recordings, our model can predict the participants’ well-being scores with a mean absolute error of 14%, relative to the self-reported well-being (“ground truth”). Both audio and text features from the recordings, especially, MFCC and semantic features, are important for prediction accuracy. Based on the work, we provide suggestions for future research to further improve the prediction result.\n",

      " While virtual character embodiment has been studied as a mitigator of singular societal biases in fully immersive VR and empathy games, there have been no major studies on representation featuring standard game play or intersectional identities. In our study, participants played a short 2D video game with racial and gender character manipulations. They then rated a LinkedIn profile application to examine interactions of racial and gender biases. White male participants showed bias against black and female applicants, with the black female applicant experiencing both racial and gender bias. However, participants who embodied certain underrepresented characters in the game displayed reduced biases. Participants’ perceived identification with the characters moderated this effect. The study highlights a lack of homogeneity in the prevalence and potential reduction of different societal biases and incorporates intersectionality to illustrate how multiple parts of a player character’s identity can be used to combat biases.\n",

      "ReWIND is a role-playing game (RPG) designed to enhance the emotion control of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) over the feeling of excessive worry and fear by integrating cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a serious game. The goal of the game is to allow players to virtually encounter different anxiety-causing situations and provide constructive measures to deal with negative feelings following the ABC-model of CBT (antecedent, belief, consequence) along with disputation and new effect. The storyline's foundation focuses on four emotion regulation strategies common in GAD: catastrophizing, rumination, denial, and lack of refocus on planning. Each strategy consists of three scenarios that simulate real-life occurrences where GAD patients might find them hard to overcome. CBT elements are integrated with the diegetic components implemented in the game to provide psychoeducation in a fun way, which can be used to complement counseling.\n",

      " From the perspective of the prevalence of social media rumors, we put forward the concept of cultural heuristic and explore how it influences the attitude and behavior of the Chinese citizens towards rumors when facing epidemic again, i.e., COVID-19. We recruit 12 Chinese citizens to conduct semi-structured interviews, and use grounded theory to analyze the data coding. The results show that China’s unique cultural, social and historical background and collective behavior convey the attitudes and beliefs to rumors thus lead to behavior. This study is an exploration of rumor culture in non-Western society. It can help us have a better understanding of the cultural cognition and value orientation between Chinese citizens and rumors.\n",

      "You may feel special and believe that you are getting personalized care when your doctor remembers your name and your unique medical history. But, what if it is an AI doctor and not human? Since AI systems are driven by personalization algorithms, it is possible to design AI doctors that can individuate patients with great precision. Is this appreciated or perceived as eerie and intrusive, thereby negatively affecting doctor-patient interaction? We decided to find out by designing a healthcare chatbot that identified itself as AI, Human, or Human assisted by AI. In a user study assessing Covid-19 risk, participants interacted twice, 10 days apart, with a bot that either individuated them or not. Data show that individuation by an AI doctor lowers patient compliance. Surprisingly, a majority of participants in the human doctor condition thought that they chatted with an AI doctor. Findings provide implications for design of healthcare chat applications.\n",

      "Wildlife calls are the best witnesses to the health of ecosystems, if only we know how to listen to them. Efforts to understand and inform restoration of healthy ecosystems with environmental audio recordings languish from insufficient tools to learn and identify sounds in recordings. To address this problem, we designed and playtested the Bristle Whistle Challenge prototype with ten players. We explored how to design delightful interactions with audio for gaining awareness of nature sounds and supporting wildlife conservation through citizen science. We found that rather than presenting audio alone, it was necessary to connect sounds to other senses and experiences in creative ways to impart meaning and enhance engagement. We offer recommendations to design creative and contextual interactions with media to build awareness of nature's wonders. We call for greater efforts in interaction design to engage people with nature, which is the key to turning around our environmental crisis.\n",

      " Aimed at breaking up the myth of the “average user”, the notion of personalization promises to solve the contradiction between the population’s heterogeneity and one-size-fits-all security nudges. To further explore the promising avenue, we propose to design personalized security nudges targeted at different mindsets and make the Consideration for Future Consequences (CFC) the testbed. Namely, we designed two CFC-targeted security nudges, Promotion and Prevention, for the individuals who care about future and immediate consequences, respectively. An online survey (N = 145) was conducted to test their effectiveness. Results show that both the nudges can improve users’ security attitudes, while the moderation effects imply that the Promotion nudge is merely effective for the users having deep concerns about future consequences. The findings indicate the feasibility of designing security nudges targeted at future orientations and illustrate the importance of tailoring nudges according to individuals’ differences.\n",

      " The behavior of self-driving cars may differ from people’s expectations (e.g. an autopilot may unexpectedly relinquish control). This expectation mismatch can cause potential and existing users to distrust self-driving technology and can increase the likelihood of accidents. We propose a simple but effective framework, AutoPreview, to enable consumers to preview a target autopilot’s potential actions in the real-world driving context before deployment. For a given target autopilot, we design a delegate policy that replicates the target autopilot behavior with explainable action representations, which can then be queried online for comparison and to build an accurate mental model. To demonstrate its practicality, we present a prototype of AutoPreview integrated with the CARLA simulator along with two potential use cases of the framework. We conduct a pilot study to investigate whether or not AutoPreview provides deeper understanding about autopilot behavior when experiencing a new autopilot policy for the first time. Our results suggest that the AutoPreview method helps users understand autopilot behavior in terms of driving style comprehension, deployment preference, and exact action timing prediction.\n",

From a reference video, cinematic features such as the start frame, end frame, framing, camera movement, and the visual features of the subjects are extracted automatically. The extracted information is used to generate the virtual camera layout, which resembles the camera layout of the reference video. Our method handles stylized as well as human characters with body proportions different from those of humans. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with various reference videos and 3D animation scenes. The user evaluation results show that the generated layouts are comparable to layouts created by the artist, allowing us to assert that our method can provide effective assistance to both novice and professional users when positioning a virtual camera.\n",

We present Spacewalker, a tool that allows designers to rapidly search a large design space for an optimal web UI with integrated support. Designers first annotate each attribute they want to explore in a typical HTML page, using a simple markup extension we designed. Spacewalker then parses the annotated HTML specification, and intelligently generates and distributes various configurations of the web UI to crowd workers for evaluation. We enhanced a genetic algorithm to accommodate crowd worker responses from pairwise comparison of UI designs, which is crucial for obtaining reliable feedback. Based on our experiments, Spacewalker allows designers to effectively search a large design space of a UI, using the language they are familiar with, and improve their design rapidly at a minimal cost.\n",

We conducted interviews with 16 experienced, disabled knitters and analyzed 20 threads from six forums that discussed accessible knitting to identify how and why disabled knitters knit, and what accessibility concerns remain. We additionally conducted an iterative design case study developing knitting tools for a knitter who found existing solutions insufficient. Our innovations improved the range of stitches she could produce.

A wearable worn in such a manner is in direct contact with the user’s skin. We leverage this proximity to test the performance of 10 on-skin sensations (Press, Poke, Pinch, Heat, Cool, Blow, Suck, Vibrate, Moisture and Brush) as methods of notification delivery. We developed prototypes for each stimulus and conducted a user study to evaluate them across 6 locations commonly covered by upper body clothing. Results indicate significant differences in reaction time, error rates and comfort which may influence the design of future under-clothing wearables.\n",

      "Sharing humor within a team can have various benefits. In multilingual teams, however, it is often challenging for nonnative-speaking members (NNS) of the team to fully understand the humor shared among native speakers (NS). In an interview study with 28 NNS, we identified common sources of confusion in humorous interactions. Our study also revealed that the (mis)alignment of people's assumptions of others’ knowledge is key to failed humor and its consequences. NNS felt that NS often assumed everyone shared the knowledge required to understand their humor; thus, cultural references unfamiliar to NNS were a dominant source of confusion. On the other hand, NNS often felt ignorant for not knowing the references required to understand NS humor, as they assumed all the references unfamiliar to them must be generic knowledge known by all NS. We propose design ideas for better alignment of common ground assumptions between NS and NNS to facilitate humor-related communication and alleviate possible negative consequence of failed humor.\n",

This case study describes and discusses the user-centered approach taken to successfully merge two established online LaTeX editors: Overleaf and ShareLaTeX. A mixed methods approach was used to simultaneously ensure broad coverage of the user base (quantitative; relevant because these were established products) and also in-depth understanding of their issues, opinions and motivations (qualitative; relevant to making informed design decisions).

      "Enabling healthier online deliberation around issues of public concerns is an increasingly vital challenge in nowadays society. Two fundamental components of a healthier deliberation are: i. the capability of people to make sense of what they read, so that their contribution can be relevant; and ii. the improvement of the overall quality of the debate, so that noise can be reduced and useful signals can inform collective decision making. Platform designers often resort to computational aids to improve these two processes. In this paper, we examine automated reporting as promising mean of improving sensemaking in discussion platforms. We compared three approaches to automated reporting: an abstractive summariser, a template report and an argumentation highlighting system. We then evaluated improvements in sensemaking of participants and the perception on overall quality of the debate. The study suggests that argument mining technologies are particularly promising computational aids to improve sense making and perceived quality of online discussion, thanks to their capability to combine computational models for automated reasoning with users’ cognitive needs and expectation of automated reporting. \n",

      " The pandemic has caused a significant increase in the use of videoconferencing for oral presentations. Prior work demonstrated that an embodied conversational agent that co-delivers an oral presentation could be used in face-to-face presentations to reduce public speaking anxiety and increase presentation quality. In this work, we evaluate the use of a co-presenter agent in the delivery of virtual presentations given over a videoconferencing system, comparing them to presentations given without the agent. We found that participants were satisfied with the co-presenter agent, and those who liked the agent (scoring above the mean on a composite self-report measure of satisfaction) rated the presentations they gave with the agent as having significantly higher quality compared to those given without the agent. There was evidence the agent helped participants feel less nervous about their talks. Interviews confirmed these findings, and identified additional advantages and disadvantages of using co-presenter agents in virtual presentations.\n",

      " We propose a study on the effects of live streaming on an educational game’s learning outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the call for interactive online learning experiences. There is a growing body of literature examining learning on platforms such as Twitch, and studies have shown that enhancing in-game performance is possible from viewing a stream. However, little work has explored whether learning from live streaming educational games, where in-game performance relates to educational outcomes outside of the game context, is possible. We share the details of our proposed study, in which an educational game called Angle Jungle will streamed to participants, and learning gains will be compared to three non-live streamed conditions. By executing this study, we can understand the benefits and shortcomings of current live streaming interfaces in supporting educational games, paving the way for the design of novel and interactive learning experiences built for live streaming platforms.\n",

      "Out of hospital cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event that requires immediate resuscitation actions. Therefore, digital volunteer responder initiatives integrate nearby users who can be activated anytime, anywhere through mobile technologies to assist in administering first aid. While research has found that such initiatives increases the chances of surviving, we know little about how responders use the digital services, and how they organize themselves before, during, and after responding. We conducted interviews with volunteer responders (N=16) to address how they perceive these initiatives and in particular how they negotiate availability temporally (anytime) and spatially (anywhere) for such life-threatening events. Our findings show that our responders exhibited strong perceptions of how and why one should volunteer. Also, the temporal aspect of being available anytime integrates several dimensions, while being available anywhere is highly related to safety, community and group roles. Finally, we discuss implications for design of volunteer responder initiatives. \n",

While previous research has studied player motivations and experiences for certain categories of digital games, there has yet to be such a study on digital board games, especially in the modern context of smartphone apps. To address this, we conduct a case study of a popular board game, Ludo, to understand players’ opinions of its digital adaptation. For this, we study the functionality and user reviews of nine popular Ludo apps, to assess player opinions of how traditional gameplay has been re-imagined. Based upon our analysis, we conclude with recommendations for improving Ludo apps and other apps, based on random chance board games.\n",

      "Transnational newcomers, i.e., foreign-born populations who move to a new country, rely on consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce (C2C e-commerce) to access local resources for adaptation. However, with low trust among transnational newcomers who enter a new country, they often face difficulties in the adaptation process, and little is known about which determinants affect their trust in C2C e-commerce. Because social identity is often complicated in transnational newcomers’ adaptation process, our work focuses on unpacking shared identity, a key trust antecedent in C2C e-commerce. We interviewed 12 transnational newcomers in the United States to identify the determinants of their shared identity in C2C e-commerce. Our preliminary results suggest that shared identity determinants include geographic proximity, ethnic background, life stage, and socio-economic status. We also uncovered ways that shared identity determinants influence transnational newcomers’ trust in local C2C e-commerce. Our work contributes two research implications to future studies on transnational newcomers’ technology use.\n",

      " This study explores non-verbal co-design techniques with multisensory wearables to give the body a voice. Sessions were led with professional caregivers, parents, and clients with PIMD (profound intellectual and multiple disabilities) to find fundamental building blocks for a common language based on tangible technologies. To provide an agent for communication we employed the tools of extimacy - translating biodata to visual, auditory, or tactile interactive displays. The caregivers expressed the need for action – reaction “Actie Reactie” to keep attention, which was an update from the Multisensory Environment (MSE) rooms previously used to calm. In the co-design sessions, we found the on-the-body wearables held the most focus. The final discovery from the study became the outline for creating a modular, highly personalized kit for a Multisensory Wearable (MSW) to inspire surprise and wonder. \n",

      " The advent of larger machine learning (ML) models have improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various modeling tasks, ranging from computer vision to natural language. As ML models continue increasing in size, so does their respective energy consumption and computational requirements. However, the methods for tracking, reporting, and comparing energy consumption remain limited. We present EnergyVis, an interactive energy consumption tracker for ML models. Consisting of multiple coordinated views, EnergyVis enables researchers to interactively track, visualize and compare model energy consumption across key energy consumption and carbon footprint metrics (kWh and CO2), helping users explore alternative deployment locations and hardware that may reduce carbon footprints. EnergyVis aims to raise awareness concerning computational sustainability by interactively highlighting excessive energy usage during model training; and by providing alternative training options to reduce energy usage.\n",

However, these rural communities, and in particular the marginalized populations within them, could greatly benefit from our work. I believe that one way to set the stage for deeper engagement with rural communities is by creating cultural micro-exposures—small brushes with the everyday realities of a culture or lived experience that is different from one’s own—using technology.\n",

      " Writing research papers can be extremely challenging for new academic authors or entire scientific communities, with their own review and style guidelines like CHI. The impact of everything that we do as researchers is based on how we communicate it. Writing for CHI is a core skill to learn because it is hard to turn a research project into a successful CHI publication. This online edition of the successful CHI paper writing course offers hands-on advice and more in-depth tutorials on how to write papers with clarity, substance, and style. It is structured into four online units with a focus on writing CHI papers.\n",

      " People with visual impairments face challenges in scene and object recognition, especially in unknown environments. We combined the mobile scene detection framework Apple ARKit with MobileNet-v2 and 3D spatial audio to provide an auditory scene description to people with visual impairments. The combination of ARKit and MobileNet allows keeping recognized objects in the scene even if the user turns away from the object. An object can thus serve as an auditory landmark. With a search function, the system can even guide the user to a particular item. The system also provides spatial audio warnings for nearby objects and walls to avoid collisions. We evaluated the implemented app in a preliminary user study. The results show that users can find items without visual feedback using the proposed application. The study also reveals that the range of local object detection through MobileNet-v2 was insufficient, which we aim to overcome using more accurate object detection frameworks in future work (YOLOv5x).\n",

      " While the growth of financial technologies (FinTech) is making the flow of money faster, easier, and more secure, such technologies are often unable to serve many countries due to the global political environment. Despite its severe impact, this issue has remained understudied in the HCI literature. We address this gap by presenting our findings from a three-month-long ethnography with the Iranian community in Toronto, Canada. We present their struggles in transferring money to and from their home country - a process that entails financial loss, fear, uncertainty, and privacy breaches. We also outline the informal workarounds that allow this community to circumvent these challenges, along with the associated hassles. This paper contributes to broadening the scope of FinTech in the HCI literature by connecting it with the politics surrounding transnational transactions. We discuss the design implications of our findings and their contribution to the broader interests of HCI in mobilities and social justice.\n",

      " We have developed a conversational recommendation system designed to help users navigate through a set of limited options to find the best choice. Unlike many internet scale systems that use a singular set of search terms and return a ranked list of options from amongst thousands, our system uses multi-turn user dialog to deeply understand the user’s preferences. The system responds in context to the user’s specific and immediate feedback to make sequential recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64 scenario-based search journeys. When our recommendation system was successfully triggered, we saw both an increase in efficiency and a higher confidence rating with respect to final user choice. We also found that users preferred our system (75%) compared with the baseline.\n",

      "In the field of sports, visually impaired spectators are unfortunately at a disadvantage in terms of understanding the precise developments of a game. To provide such information to them, making play-by-play announcements of the live coverage of the game is the best approach; however, this is infeasible as it is difficult to employ a professional commentator for every game. Therefore, this study proposes a blind football play-by-play system, combining a tactile graphic display function and a position acquisition function, to aid visually impaired spectators understand game developments. To conduct a basic study, an experimental system was developed herein, which detects the positions of the players and ball using image processing technology and deep learning, and shows these positions via a refreshable tactile display. The validity of the proposed system was then established through subjective experiments. This system provides a rich user experience to the spectators as well as being a powerful feedback tool to the players. Moreover, an audio–tactile graphic system, which can be used to overcome tactile cognitive limitations, can be implemented as an application of the system in the future.\n",

      " Smart Helmet is a new wearable device to monitor wildland firefighters’ real-time bio-signal data and alert potential health issues, i.e., dehydration. In this paper, we applied the human-centered design method to develop Smart Helmet for firefighters. We initially conducted multiple rounds of primary research to collect user needs and the deployment constraints by interviewing 80 firefighters. Targeted on dehydration caused by heat exhaustion and overexertion, we developed a smart helmet prototype, named FireWorks, with an array of sensors collecting the firefighter’s bio-signals, including body temperature, heart rate, and motions. When abnormal bio-signal levels are detected, the alert system will notify the firefighter and their supervisor. The notification is achieved by an on-device algorithm that predicts imminent health risks. Further, we designed a mobile application to display real-time and historical bio-signal data as well as alert users about potential dehydration issues. In the end, we ran user evaluation studies and iterated the prototype based on user feedback, and we ran the functional evaluation to make sure all the implemented functions work properly.\n",

In this research, we focused on elucidating the mechanism of such enthusiastic group interaction (collective effervescence) and how technology can contribute to its enhancement. We propose a support system for co-experience and physical co-actions among participants to enhance enthusiastic interaction between performers and audiences during live performances. This system focuses on a physical synchronization between the performer and the audience as the key that generates enthusiastic interaction during a live performance. Also, it supports enhanced bidirectional communication of the performer's actions and the audience's cheering behaviors. An experiment in an actual live performance environment in which collective effervescence was already occurring demonstrated that the bidirectional communication and visualization of physical movements in the proposed system contributed to the further unification of the group.\n",

      " Haptic feedback significantly enhances virtual experiences. However, supporting haptics currently requires modifying the codebase, making it impractical to add haptics to popular, high-quality experiences such as best selling games, which are typically closed-source. We present HapticSeer, a multi-channel, black-box, platform-agnostic approach to detecting game events for real-time haptic feedback. The approach is based on two key insights: 1) all games have 3 types of data streams: video, audio, and controller I/O, that can be analyzed in real-time to detect game events, and 2) a small number of user interface design patterns are reused across most games, so that event detectors can be reused effectively. We developed an open-source HapticSeer framework and implemented several real-time event detectors for commercial PC and VR games. We validated system correctness and real-time performance, and discuss feedback from several haptics developers that used the HapticSeer framework to integrate research and commercial haptic devices.\n",

      " Smart energy management systems incorporate advanced sensing and control technologies that enable users to monitor and reduce their energy consumption through interactive visualisations and automated control features. Plug load management systems (PLMS), in particular, are applications of such systems targeting electrical devices found in homes and workplaces. While past studies have mostly focused on PLMS adoption in homes, past literature indicates several key differences in user motivation as office users typically do not bear the cost of their consumption. This reduces their motivation to embrace such systems, resulting in low adoption rates. In our research, we examined user perception of adopting PLMS in the workplace through a series of focus group discussions and an online survey guided by findings from the focus group discussions. By analysing the quantitative and qualitative responses from 101 participants, we identified six design implications to guide the development of future PLMS in the workplace.\n",

      " In this study, we propose PicPop, a pop-up picture book system that uses mid-air images to make digital images pop out from a flat picture book. The user does not need to wear a special device to have an interactive experience with pop-up picture books that employ the proposed system. A reflective type of paper is used to turn the book into a display surface for projecting mid-air images onto. Furthermore, we realized a reduction in the overall volume of the system as compared to the conventional reflective mid-air image-display method, while retaining the desired luminance of the mid-air images. \n",

      "Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs) teach academic and functional living skills simultaneously to prepare students with vision impairment to be successful and independent. Current educational tools primarily focus on academic instruction rather than this multifaceted approach needed for students. Our work aims to understand how technology can integrate behavioral skills, like independence, and support TVIs in their preferred teaching strategy. We observed elementary classrooms at a school for the blind for six weeks to study how educators design lessons and use technology to supplement their instruction in different subjects. After the observational study, we conducted remote interviews with educators to understand how technology can support students in building academic and behavioral skills in-person and remotely. Educators suggested incorporating audio feedback that motivates students to play and learn consistently, student progress tracking for parents and educators, and designing features that help students build independence and develop collaborative skills.\n",

      "In this dissertation, I present measurement methods to automatically identify manipulative user interfaces—colloquially known as “dark patterns”—at scale on the web. Using these methods, I quantify the prevalence of dark patterns in three studies and show how dark patterns are rampant on the web, thus a pressing concern for society.  First, I examine whether social media content creators, or “influencers,” disclose their relationships with advertisers to their audience. Analyzing over 500K YouTube videos and 2.1M Pinterest pins, I find that only about 10% of all advertising content is disclosed to users. Second, I examine various types of dark patterns in shopping websites. Analyzing data from 11K shopping websites, I discover over 1,800 dark patterns on over 1,200 websites that mislead users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Third, I examine dark patterns in political emails from the 2020 U.S. election cycle. Through an analysis of over 100K emails, I find that over 40% of emails from the median sender contain dark patterns that nudge recipients to open emails or make donations they might otherwise not make. I further outlay the conceptual foundation of dark patterns and articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing the effects of dark patterns. I conclude with how the lessons learned from the studies can be used to build technical defenses and to lay out policy recommendations to mitigate the spread of these interfaces. \n",

      " The current state of audio rendering algorithms allows efficient sound propagation, reflecting realistic acoustic properties of real environments. Among factors affecting realism of acoustic simulations is the mapping between an environment’s geometry, and acoustic information of materials represented. We present a pipeline to infer material characteristics from their visual representations, providing an automated mapping. A trained image classifier estimates semantic material information from textured meshes mapping predicted labels to a database of measured frequency-dependent absorption coefficients; trained on a material image patches generated from superpixels, it produces inference from meshes, decomposing their unwrapped textures. The most frequent label from predicted texture patches determines the acoustic material assigned to the input mesh. We test the pipeline on a real environment, capturing a conference room and reconstructing its geometry from point cloud data. We estimate a Room Impulse Response (RIR) of the virtual environment, which we compare against a measured counterpart.\n",

      " While machine learning algorithms continue to improve, their success often relies upon the data scientists’ ability to detect patterns, determine useful features and visualizations, select good models, and evaluate and iterate upon results. Data scientists often spend a long time making very little progress as they struggle to determine how to proceed. In this respect, the understanding of data scientists’ workflows and challenges has recently attracted a great deal of scholarly interest. However, the literature is mostly based on interviews and qualitative research methodologies. With this in mind, we developed DSWorkFlow, a data collection framework that provides researchers with the ability to observe and analyze data scientists’ cognitive workflows as they develop predictive models. Using DSWorkFlow, researchers can collect data from a Jupyter Notebook, to reconstruct the code execution order and extract relevant information about data scientist workflow alongside the concomitant collection of qualitative data. We tested the framework experimentally with seven data scientists as they each created three machine learning models to inform our extraction algorithms.\n",

      "Effective communication of genetic risk is increasingly important for prevention and treatment of hereditary cancer syndromes. Many individuals do not have access to genetic counselors, or lack the ability to understand and act on genetic risks, due to the complexity of the information. Automated approaches that incorporate animated pedagogical conversational agents may address these barriers. We describe a pedagogical agent that functions in the role of a virtual genetic counselor that discusses hereditary breast cancer risk and motivates women to obtain breast cancer screening. We report the design and evaluation of two prototypes of the virtual counselor. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, and the effectiveness in improving breast cancer genetics knowledge, by adapting the virtual counselor's pedagogical strategies to an individual's comprehension based on dynamic assessments and preferences.\n",

      "The emerging possibilities of multisensory interactions provide an exciting space for disability and open up opportunities to explore new experiences for perceiving one's own body, it's interactions with the environment and also to explore the environment itself. In addition, dynamic aspects of living with disability, life transitions, including ageing, psychological distress, long-term conditions such as chronic pain and new conditions such as long-COVID further affect people's abilities. Interactions with this diversity of embodiments can be enriched, empowered and augmented through using multisensory and cross-sensory modalities to create more inclusive technologies and experiences. To explore this, in this workshop we will explore three related sub-domains: immersive multi-sensory experiences, embodied experiences, and disability interactions and design. The aim is to better understand how we can re-think the senses in technology design for disability interactions and the dynamic self, constructed through continuously changing sensing capabilities either because of changing ability or because of the empowering technology. This workshop will: (i) bring together HCI researchers from different areas, (ii) discuss tools, frameworks and methods, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration.\n",

      "Retail experiences have started adopting Augmented Reality (AR) as a tool to let customers see products in their space before committing to a purchase. Although online retailers use high resolution 3D models to create onsite imagery, limitations in the rendering capabilities of phones require them to optimize models for real-time use, diminishing the visual quality of the experience and widening the gap between what the customer thinks they are buying and what they get. We present Fused Photo, a system that leverages AR to capture the customer’s spatial context and recreate it in a remote rendering environment that then composites photorealistic images of products onto their space. Results show that Fused Photos outperform other AR visualizations in the market both in realism and ability to represent a product’s appearance, while being comparable in quality to photorealistic renders staged manually by artists. \n",

      "Artificial intelligences (AI) are increasingly being embodied and embedded in the world to carry out tasks and support decision-making with and for people. Robots, recommender systems, voice assistants, virtual humans—do these disparate types of embodied AI have something in common? Here we show how they can manifest as “socially embodied AI.” We define this as the state that embodied AI “circumstantially” take on within interactive contexts when perceived as both social and agentic by people. We offer a working ontology that describes how embodied AI can dynamically transition into socially embodied AI. We propose an ontological heuristic for describing the threshold: the Tepper line. We reinforce our theoretical work with expert insights from a card sort workshop. We end with two case studies to illustrate the dynamic and contextual nature of this heuristic.\n",

Users have to make privacy-related decisions already before app installation because once installed, apps can access potential privacy-sensitive data. In this work-in-progress, we present an in-depth investigation of privacy indicator visualizations for mobile app stores. We report the results of two consecutive user studies in which we investigate 1) visual depiction, 2) score, and 3) monetary value of collected data. Our studies reveal that a visual depiction by a privacy meter were easiest to understand for users, scores were easiest to spot, and monetary value was most difficult to interpret and requires further investigation.\n",

      "Human-Drone Interaction is a fast-growing subset of the field of Human-Computer Interaction as drones enable novel and interesting interactions in 3D space as they can be regarded as pixels in physical space. We examine the intersection of drones and play and explore how drones can facilitate playful bodily experiences by pervading the physical space. We focus on “Paida” play to build explorative play experiences that pervade the player's physical environment. This work resulted in three play experiences built around simple interaction methods, in addition to observations from our design process, and three design strategies; drone-based play lends itself to collaborative play, such play benefits from simple designs, and designers benefit from designing for multiple players. From these design strategies, we set a starting point for designing novel, pervasive, and playful interactions whilst regarding drones as pixels in the physical space.\n",

If respect for human wellbeing is to become a genuine priority with measurable impact, then technology will need to change too. Designers are in a position to lead this change by integrating wellbeing psychology into design practice. This course will equip technology-makers with research-based knowledge and skills for practicing “wellbeing supportive design”, and for improving UX across the board by supporting psychological health.\n",

      " Most children who are blind live in low-resource settings and attend schools that have poor technical infrastructure, overburdened teachers, and outdated curriculum. Our work explores the role digital games can play to develop digital skills of such children in the early grades. Recognizing the critical role of teachers in introducing children to technology, we conducted a mixed-methods study to examine which attributes of digital games teachers find useful for children and what challenges they perceive in integrating digital games in schools for the blind. Our findings indicate that teachers prefer games that align well with curriculum objectives, promote learning, improve soft skills, and increase engagement with computers. Despite being overburdened and lacking technological support, teachers expressed strong enthusiasm to integrate these games in school curriculum and schedule. We conclude by discussing design implications for designers of accessible games in low-resource settings. \n",

      "Frequent monitoring of participant compliance is necessary when conducting large-scale, longitudinal studies to ensure that the collected data is of sufficiently high quality. While the need for achieving high compliance has been underscored and there are discussions on incentives and factors affecting compliance, little is shared about the actual processes and tools used for monitoring compliance in such studies. Monitoring participant compliance with respect to multi-modal data can be a tedious process, especially if there are only a few personnel involved. In this case study, we describe the iterative design of an interactive visualization system we developed for monitoring compliance and refined based on changing requirements in an ongoing study. We find that the visualization system, leveraging the digital medium, both facilitates the exploratory tasks of monitoring participant compliance and supports asynchronous collaboration among non-co-located researchers. Our documented requirements for checking participant compliance as well as the design of the visualization system can help inform the compliance-monitoring process in future studies.\n",

      " Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as an approach to understand intelligence in both humans and machines. However, if RL is to have a meaningful impact in human–computer interaction, it is critical that these two threads are integrated. This is required for genuinely interactive RL-based systems which take into account user capacities and preferences. This workshop will build a community and form a research agenda for investigating RL in HCI.\n",

      "People engage in sportive activities for reasons beyond improving their athletic performance. They also seek experiences like fun, adventure, a feeling of oneness, clear their heads, and flow. Since sport is a highly bodily experience, we argue that taking an embodied interaction perspective to inspire interaction design of sports systems is a promising direction in HCI research and practice. This workshop will address the challenges of designing interactive systems in the realm of sports from an embodied interaction perspective focusing on athletes’ experience rather than performance. We will explore how interactive systems enhance sports experience without distracting from the actual goal of the athlete, such as freeing the mind. We will focus on several topics of interest such as sensory augmentation, augmented experience, multi-modal interaction, and motor learning in sports. \n",

      "With a growing interest in HCI around food, there is a trend to combine computing technology and food to facilitate novel eating experiences. However, most current systems tend to superimpose the technology over food rather than consider food itself as a focal interaction material. This paper proposes a more direct computational food integration by conceptualizing the notion of “Cyber Food”, accentuating “food as computational artifact”, where food embodies digital computation that can be ultimately consumed and digested by the human body. With this work, we attempt to open a new pathway to enrich human-food interactions beyond the traditional boundaries between the physical (edible) and digital realms.\n",

      "We present Connected Companion (CoCo), a health tracking wearable that provides users with timely, context-relevant notifications aimed at improving wellness. Traditionally, self-tracking wearables report basic health data such as resting heart rate; these data are visualised and positive behaviours (e.g. exercising often) are encouraged with rudimentary gamification (e.g. award badges) and notification systems. CoCo is the first wearable to combine caffeine, alcohol and cortisol sensors, a context network (which predicts user context), and a wellness model (which establishes per-user wellness measures). Working in tandem these provide users with notifications that encourage discrete behaviours intended to optimise user-wellness per very specific biological and social contexts. The paper describes the (sometimes unexpected) results of a user-study intended to evaluate CoCo's efficacy and we conclude with a discussion about the power and responsibility that comes with attempts to build context-aware computing systems.\n",

      " Hyperscanning is an emerging method for measuring two or more brains simultaneously. This method allows researchers to simultaneously record neural activity from two or more people. While this method has been extensively implemented over the last five years in the real-world to study inter-brain synchrony, there is little work that has been undertaken in the use of hyperscanning in virtual environments. Preliminary research in the area demonstrates that inter-brain synchrony in virtual environments can be achieved in a manner similar to that seen in the real world. The study described in this paper proposes to further research in the area by studying how non-verbal communication cues in social interactions in virtual environments can affect inter-brain synchrony. In particular, we concentrate on the role eye gaze plays in inter-brain synchrony. The aim of this research is to explore how eye gaze affects inter-brain synchrony between users in a collaborative virtual environment. \n",

      "Cognitive load assessment has become an integral part of human-centered design as it enables cognition-aware systems to adapt to users’ needs. Among the range of physiological metrics, task-evoked pupillary responses have been implemented successfully to determine mental workload. Only recently, smooth pursuit eye-movements as another oculomotor indicator was suggested to index cognitive processing demands. The current study provides a comparison of both parameters with regard to the capacity to differentiate task load in an auditory n-back task. Results replicate earlier findings, suggesting pupil diameter to display the level of mental workload. However, task loads during high levels of difficulty are not distinguishable. Task difficulty also influences gaze behaviour during smooth pursuit eye-movements, although far less sensitive. A clear distinction is achieved only between low and high workloads. In contrast, a combination of control measures (reaction times, accuracy rates) is suited to distinguish between all n-back task stages.\n",

      " As machine learning is applied to an increasingly large number of domains, the need for an effective way to explain its predictions grows apace. In the domain of child welfare screening, machine learning offers a promising method of consolidating the large amount of data that screeners must look at, potentially improving the outcomes for children reported to child welfare departments. Interviews and case-studies suggest that adding an explanation alongside the model prediction may result in better outcomes, but it is not obvious what kind of explanation would be most useful in this context. Through a series of interviews and user studies, we developed Sibyl, a machine learning explanation dashboard specifically designed to aid child welfare screeners’ decision making. When testing Sibyl, we evaluated four different explanation types, and based on this evaluation, decided a local feature contribution approach was most useful to screeners.\n",

      "Avatar appearance, especially gender, influences user behavior in virtual environments (VE). However the effect is often examined only as a co-variant. In this paper, we use technology to empower individuals beyond traditional societal gender roles to effectively collaborate in virtual environments. We specifically investigate the impact of the partner’s avatar gender on the quality of collaboration in the VE, while performing an inherently male-dominated task. We designed a virtual garage, where pairs of same (C1) and mixed (C2) gender repair cars collaboratively. We evaluated the interaction using a collaboration questionnaire adopted from Team Effective Questionnaire (TEQ). Our results show that same-gender pairs were perceived as more productive and supportive. We envision that our work aids developers and researchers in enhancing the collaboration quality by supporting group cohesion and positive interactions. \n",

We present a co-design study where we learned about people’s preferences and ideas for customized glucose monitors. We worked with people who have Type 1 Diabetes and learned about their challenges with current glucose monitors and ways to address them in physical product design. To understand people’s perception towards using customizable glucose monitors, we prototyped one simple example toolkit, DiaFit, consisting of multiple modular accessories for assembling glucose monitors. We invited participants to try DiaFit and learned about their acceptability of customizable glucose monitors. We conclude with preliminary lessons learned about customization as an approach to addressing individual differences in the context of health technologies.\n",

      "Conversations with Holocaust survivors are an integral part of education at schools and universities as well as part of the German memory culture. The goal of interactive stereoscopic digital Holocaust testimonies is to preserve the effects of meeting and interacting with these contemporary witnesses as faithfully as possible. These virtual humans are non-synthetic. Instead, all their actions, such as answers and movements, are pre-recorded. We conducted a preliminary study to gauge how people perceive this first German-speaking digital interactive Holocaust testimony. The focus of our investigation is the ease-of-use, the accuracy and relevance of the answers given as well as the authenticity and emotiveness of the virtual contemporary witness, as perceived by the participants. We found that digital 3D testimonies can convey emotions and lead to enjoyable experiences, which correlates with the frequency of correctly matched answers.\n",

Across papers and reports, these visuals demonstrate people’s use of devices, explain systems, or show design spaces. Creating such figures is challenging, and very little is known about the overarching strategies for visually representing interaction scenarios. To mitigate this task, we contribute a unified taxonomy of design elements that compose such figures. In particular, we provide a detailed classification of Structural and Interaction strategies, such as composition, visual techniques, dynamics, representation of users, and many others – all in context of the type of scenarios. This taxonomy can inform researchers’ choices when creating new figures, by providing a concise synthesis of visual strategies, and revealing approaches they were not aware of before. Furthermore, to support the community for creating further taxonomies, we also provide three open-source software facilitating the coding process and visual exploration of the coding scheme.\n",

      " Drug addiction is a chronic disorder associated with many of the emotional or cognitive problems observed in addicted individuals. As a result, drug-addicted patients often display deficits in their mind-body awareness and easily ignore or fail to identify emotional or environmental cues. This study conducted a needs assessment study to gain guidelines for incorporating virtual reality and biofeedback technologies to assist psychotherapists in raising patients’ awareness and identifying their cues in psychotherapy. Our results identify current difficulties to reinforce mind-body awareness and correct attributions of craving stimuli. Also, we summarized concerns and the potential to promote the effectiveness of psychotherapy when applying virtual reality and biofeedback technologies to induce cravings. We also proposed a preliminary design of technology solutions to incorporate clinical-friendly VR-based craving inducing along with real-time biofeedback for enabling psychotherapists to jointly review the induced craving events based on the collected information.\n",
