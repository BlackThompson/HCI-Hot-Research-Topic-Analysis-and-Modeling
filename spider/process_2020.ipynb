      "The Semantic Web can be defined as an extension of the current Web, in which data is given well-defined meaning, better-enabling computers and people to work together. Linked Data (LD) has been envisioned as an essential element for the Semantic Web, listing a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. Enabling humans to interact with this data is a crucial and challenging step to bring the Semantic Web forward. In order to better understand how the Human-Computer Interaction community has contributed to this effort, this late-breaking work presents a review focusing on the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) venues. Our findings show that despite LD being a topic of interest to a variety of stakeholders, there are missing possibilities for end-users to query, browse and visualize LD, underlying the need for further investigations.\n",

      "We describe a Research-through-Design (RtD) project that explores the Internet of Things (IoT) as a resource for children's free play outdoors. Based on initial insights from a design ethnography, we developed four RtD prototypes for social play in different scenarios of use outdoors, including congregating on a street or in a park to play physical games with IoT. We observed these prototypes in use by children in their free play in two community settings, and report on the qualitative analysis of our fieldwork. Our findings highlight the designs' material qualities that encouraged social and physical play under certain conditions, suggesting social affordances that are central to the success of IoT designs for free play outdoors. We provide directions for future research that addresses the challenges faced when deploying IoT with children, contributing new considerations for interaction design with children in outdoor settings and free play contexts.\n",

      "Since its codified genesis in the 18th century, ballet training has largely been unchanged: it relies on the word of mouth expertise passed down generation to generation and on tools that do not adequately support both dancers and teachers. Moreover, top-tier training comes at an exceptional price and only found in a few locations around the world. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI)-based video tools could represent an affordable and non-invasive alternative: they would allow dancers and teachers to quantitatively self-assess as well as enable skilled ballet teachers to connect with a wider audience. In my dissertation research, I study how to design and evaluate AI-based tools for ballet dancers and teachers to quantify performance and facilitate learning.\n",

We describe Metro Futures, a region-wide public consultation on the design of new light rail trains, where we followed an experience-centred co-design approach supported by digital media and tools to develop findings with a core group of 20 ?co-researchers' and ~4000 public participants. The paper discusses how the characteristics of a focus on experience, and collaborative design exploration were achieved with co-researchers and, at scale, through online and face-to-face interactions using various digital media and tools. Whilst not at the depth of smaller scales, there are opportunities to retain characteristics of experience-centred co-design at scale to produce findings that can usefully inform ensuing design work, and avoid the averaging of public contributions often evident in large scale public consultations.\n",

      "IoT devices deliver their functionality by accessing data. Users decide which data they are willing to share via privacy settings interfaces that are typically on the device, or in the app controlling it. Thus, users have to interact with each device or app which is time-consuming and settings might be overlooked. In this paper, we provide a stepping stone into a multi-device interface for adjusting privacy settings. We present three levels of information detail: 1) sensor name 2), sensor name and information about captured data and 3) detailed information on each collected data type including consequences. Through a pre-study with 15 participants, we found that users prefer the access to detailed information because this offers the best decision support. They also wish for a clear status communication, a possibility for rule-based settings, and delegation options.\n",

      "This paper introduces document theory as a mechanism to analyze intimate platforms as sociotechnical systems. The theory, developed in documentation studies and applied to HCI, focuses on the casting mold or how agents, through particular means and modes, produce documents that govern social relations. We studied the process of creating a profile by identifying and mapping out the fields asked among the ten most popular online dating apps in the US. By looking at dating profiles as documents and their creation as a process of documentation, we argue that the current casting mold of these intimate platforms is designed to extract profit via invisibilization of labor in digital networks leading to the emergence of a constrained rational market agent. Our study illustrates how document theory makes visible the assumptions of technological systems, calling on us to imagine alternatives beyond incremental design changes given broader structural realities of market and power.\n",

In this paper, we demonstrate a process for designing crowd work for older adults; identifying their needs, designing an approach to foster their participation, and verifying its effectiveness. We found when older people feel connected to others while doing crowd work, they are highly motivated. Furthermore, gamification is an effective tool for fostering their engagement when aligned with their needs and values, as opposed to the needs and values of younger participants. Lastly, we suggest important considerations and opportunities for designing crowd work approaches for senior citizens.\n",

      "A well-designed control-to-display gain function can improve pointing performance with indirect pointing devices like trackpads. However, the design of gain functions is challenging and mostly based on trial and error. AutoGain is a novel method to individualize a gain function for indirect pointing devices in contexts where cursor trajectories can be tracked. It gradually improves pointing efficiency by using a novel submovement-level tracking+optimization technique that minimizes aiming error (undershooting/overshooting) for each submovement. We first show that AutoGain can produce, from scratch, gain functions with performance comparable to commercial designs, in less than a half-hour of active use. Second, we demonstrate AutoGain's applicability to emerging input devices (here, a Leap Motion controller) with no reference gain functions. Third, a one-month longitudinal study of normal computer use with AutoGain showed performance improvements from participants' default functions.\n",

      "In this work, we present ALEEDSA: the first system for performing interactive machine learning with augmented reality. The system is characterized by the following three distinctive features: First, immersion is used for visualizing machine learning models in terms of their outcomes. The outcomes can then be compared against domain knowledge (e.g., via counterfactual explanations) so that users can better understand the behavior of machine learning models. Second, interactivity with augmented reality along the complete machine learning pipeline fosters rapid modeling. Third, collaboration enables a multi-user setting, wherein machine learning engineers and domain experts can jointly discuss the behavior of machine learning models. The effectiveness of our proof-of-concept is demonstrated in an experimental study involving both students and business professionals. Altogether, ALEEDSA provides a more straightforward utilization of machine learning in organizational and educational practice.\n",

We conducted two user studies to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of Swap compared to traditional text revision techniques. Results showed that Swap reduced efforts in caret control and repetitive backspace pressing during the text revision process. Most participants preferred to use the replacement-based technique rather than backspace and caret. They also commented that the new technique is easy to learn, and it makes text revision rapid and intuitive.\n",

In this paper, we study whether introducing a confidence indicator, a text rating of an algorithm's confidence in its source data alongside rationale for why the data is more or less trustworthy, affects this distrust in Airbnb host profiles believed to be computer-generated. Our results indicate that a low-confidence indicator decreases participant trust in the rental host, but high-confidence indicators have no significant impact on trust. These findings suggest that user trust of AI-generated content can be negatively, but not positively, affected by a confidence indicator.\n",

It is developed by connecting miniaturized flexible printed circuit boards as two-dimensional sensor arrays with stretchable interconnects. The system is embedded in between soft deformable layers, such as textiles or rubbers. The result is a soft sensate surface that can be distributed and conformally wrap and adapt to curved structures. Each node contains a microprocessor together with a collection of nine sensors and a light-emitting diode, providing multimodal data that can be used to detect various deformation, proxemic, tactile, and environmental changes. We show that the electronic skin can sense and respond to a variety of stimuli simultaneously, as well as open up a possibility for sensor-rich virtual and augmented reality-based visualization and interaction.\n",

      "Online fraud is the well-known dark side of the modern Internet. Unsupervised fraud detection algorithms are widely used to address this problem. However, selecting features, adjusting hyperparameters, evaluating the algorithms, and eliminating false positives all require human expert involvement. In this work, we design and implement an end-to-end interactive visualization system, FDHelper, based on the deep understanding of the mechanism of the black market and fraud detection algorithms. We identify a workflow based on experience from both fraud detection algorithm experts and domain experts. Using a multi-granularity three-layer visualization map embedding an entropy-based distance metric ColDis, analysts can interactively select different feature sets, refine fraud detection algorithms, tune parameters and evaluate the detection result in near real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FDHelper through two case studies with state-of-the-art fraud detection algorithms, interviews with domain experts and algorithm experts, and a user study with eight first-time end users.\n",

      "The development of a statistical modeling program requires example data to observe and verify the behavior of the program. Such example data are either taken from an existing dataset or synthesized using commands. Programmers may want to directly design an arbitrary dataset or modify it interactively, but it is difficult to do so in current development environments. We therefore propose combining a code editor with an interactive scatter plot editor to efficiently understand the behavior of statistical modeling algorithms. The user interactively creates and modifies the dataset on the scatter plot editor, while the system continuously executes the code in the editor, taking the data as input, and shows the result in the editor. This paper presents the design rationale behind the system and introduces several usage scenarios.\n",

Yet, little is known about the viability of eye tracking hardware for gaze-guided magnification. We employed a magnification prototype to assess eye tracking quality for low-vision users as they performed reading and search tasks. We show that a high degree of tracking loss prevents current video-based eye tracking from capturing gaze input for low-vision users. Our findings show current technologies were not made with low vision users in mind, and we offer suggestions to improve gaze-tracking for diverse eye input.\n",

HCI has equal potential to find solutions for environmental challenges and script, by design, the behavioral changes needed for sustainable net futures. We explore this dichotomy through the lens of data transmission, examining the energy consumption and environmental impact of web communications. This work begins with a critical revisiting of legacy web design that mines the past for actionable ideas towards sustainable net futures. We query how we can reduce our own net energy consumption, and plot a path to design our low-power website. In addition we speculate on a redesign of the background systems, outlining the practical steps we have taken towards solar, wind, gravity and micro-hydro low-power web hosting solutions.\n",

      "Automated cars will need to observe pedestrians and react adequately to their behavior when driving in urban areas. Judging pedestrian behavior, however, is hard. When approaching it by machine learning methods, large amounts of training data is needed, which is costly and difficult to obtain, especially for critical situations. In order to provide such data, we have developed an online game inspired by Frogger, in which players have to cross streets. Accidents and critical situations are a natural part of the data produced in such a way without anybody getting hurt in reality. We present the design of our game and an analysis of the resulting data and its match to real world behavior observed in previous work. We found that behavior patterns in real and virtual environments correlated and argue that game data could be used to train machine learning algorithms for predicting real pedestrians' walking trajectories when crossing a road. This approach could be used in future automated vehicles to increase pedestrian safety.\n",

Traditional rehabilitative interventions are struggling to meet current demands, and researchers have turned to pre-operative interventions, or prehabilitation, to improve patient functions. However, existing literature primarily discusses efficacy or the use of commercial sensing devices, and lacks a clear comprehension of healthcare professionals' (HPs') needs and perspectives. User-centered stakeholder understandings are crucial for a technology's adoption, but prehabilitation literature lacks such understandings. Therefore we conduct semi-structured interviews with 12 prehabilitation healthcare professionals (HPs) to offer descriptions of care challenges, tool usage, and perspectives regarding suitable and effective technologies. These data can assist designers in fostering prehabilitation processes via tailored prehabilitation tools which meet HPs' needs and expectations.\n",

      "In recent years, in-mold electronics (IME) technique was introduced as a combination of printing electrically functional materials and vacuum plastic forming. IME has gained significant attention across various industries since it enables various electrical functionalities on a wide range of 3D geometries. Although IME shows great application potentials, hardships still exist during design for the manufacturing stage. For example, printed 2D structures experience mechanical bending and stretching during vacuum forming. This results in challenges for designers to ensure precise circuit-to-3D mold registration or to prevent over deformation of circuit and attached components. To this end, we propose a software toolkit that provides real time 2D-to-3D mapping, guided structural and electrical circuit design with interactive user interface. We present a novel software-guided IME process that leads to fully functional 3D electronic structures with printed conductive traces and assembled surface-mount components.\n",

      "Decaying representations gradually make social media content less visible to readers over time, which can help users disassociate from past online activities. We explore whether shrinking, one decaying representation, influences managers' assessments and simulated hiring decisions of job candidates, compared to seeing a full profile or an empty profile with no posts. Our 3 x 2 between-subjects crowdsourced survey (N = 360 US managers) shows that shrunk or empty profiles led to more positive decisions than profiles in their original full format. However, shrunk profiles also further contributed to more positive impressions of the candidates. Shrinking did not help the candidate of either gender more than the other and demographics of managers had limited impact on their assessment. Further, our managers regularly search job candidates' social media profiles in real life, suggesting that shrinking could support users' privacy. We finally present implications for individuals' privacy on social media.\n",

      "Contrary to our anticipation, consumption experiences do not always please us; instead, they sometimes impede our well-being. People often regret using their resources unfavorably (i.e., buyers' remorse or impulse buying) or take the pleasure of having something for granted before long (i.e., hedonic adaptation). Given its effects on optimizing positive experiences, positive emotion regulation can be useful for mitigating these issues. The present paper introduces PurPal, a self-administered behavioral intervention technology that enables users to up-regulate their positive emotions in the context of consumption. PurPal provides adaptive questions associated with users' purchase intentions, which stimulate reflection on possible future positive experiences with purchased items. A user study is planned to validate the efficacy of PurPal in a lab setting. The longer-term goal of the current research is to develop behavioral intervention technologies that support users' emotion regulation processes, enhancing their subjective well-being.\n",

      "Ecoacoustics draws together computer scientists and ecologists to achieve an understanding of ecosystems and wildlife using acoustic recordings of the environment. Computer scientists are challenged to manage increasingly large datasets while developing analytic and visualisation tools. Ecologists struggle to find and use tools that answer highly heterogeneous research questions. These two fields are naturally drawn together at the tool interface, however, less attention has been paid to how their practices influence tool design and use. We interviewed and collected email correspondence from four computer scientists and eight ecologists to learn how their practices indicate opportunities for reconciling difference through design. We found that different temporal rhythms, relationships to data, and data-driven questions demand tool configuration, data integration, and standardisation. This research outlines interfacing opportunities for new ecological research utilising large acoustic datasets, and also contributes to evolving HCI approaches in areas making use of big data and human-in-the-loop processes.\n",

      "The pervasive availability of media in foreign languages is a rich resource for language learning. However, learners are forced to interrupt media consumption whenever comprehension problems occur. We present BrainCoDe, a method to implicitly detect vocabulary gaps through the evaluation of event-related potentials (ERPs). In a user study (N=16), we evaluate BrainCoDe by investigating differences in ERP amplitudes during listening and reading of known words compared to unknown words. We found significant deviations in N400 amplitudes during reading and in N100 amplitudes during listening when encountering unknown words. To evaluate the feasibility of ERPs for real-time applications, we trained a classifier that detects vocabulary gaps with an accuracy of 87.13% for reading and 82.64% for listening, identifying eight out of ten words correctly as known or unknown. We show the potential of BrainCoDe to support media learning through instant translations or by generating personalized learning content.\n",

      "Commercially available EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) wearable headsets are always-on and are thus power hungry, requiring users to charge the headsets multiple times a day. In this paper, we tackle the problem of wake-up command design and detection for BCI headsets, and explore how battery life can be made to last for approximately a whole day. The key challenge that we address is enabling the headset to operate in a near-sleep mode but still reliably detect and interpret an EEG-based wake-up command from the user. Towards addressing the challenge, we present a solution that is built upon eye-blinks. Our core contribution is Trance, a user-friendly and robust wake-up command for BCI headsets that is computationally lightweight. We show using experimental results coupled with multiple data sets collected through user-studies that Trance can extend battery life by approximately 2.7x or to approximately 10 hours for a typical wearable battery, while remaining user-friendly.\n",

Among other forms of collaboration, there is an underdeveloped opportunity for academics to make use of industry events (conferences, meetups, design jams) as a research venue in the context of tool and method development. This paper describes three cases from work in academia-industry engagement over the last decade, in which workshops or experiments have been run at industry events as a way of trialling and developing tools directly with practitioners.

      "Will automated driving help or hurt our efforts to remedy climate change? The overall impact of transportation and mobility on the global ecosystem is clear: changes to that system can greatly affect climate outcomes. The design of mobility and automotive systems will influence key factors such as driving style, fuel choice, ride sharing, traffic patterns, and total mileage. However, to date, there are few research efforts that explicitly focus on these overlapping themes (automated driving & climate changes) within the HCI and AutomotiveUI communities. Our intention is to grow this community and awareness of the related problems. Specifically, in this workshop, we invite designers, researchers, and practitioners from the sustainable HCI, persuasive design, AutomotiveUI, and mobility communities to collaborate in finding ways to make future mobility more sustainable. Using embodied design improvisation and design fiction methods, we will explore the ways that systems affect behavior which then affect the environment.\n",

We studied a biomolecular nano-design lab that works on a current frontier of science - RNA origami - whose researchers depend on computational tools to do their work, yet are not trained as programmers. Using a participatory design process, we developed a computational labbook to concretise what computational media could look like, using the principles of computability, malleability, shareability, and distributability suggested by previous work. We used this prototype to co-reflect with the nanoscientists about how it could transform their practice. We report on the computational culture specific to this research area; the scientists' struggles managing their computational environments; and their subsequent disempowerment yet dependence. Lastly, we discuss the generative potential and limitations of the four design principles for the future of computational media.\n",

      "Playtesting of games often relies on a mixed-methods approach to obtain more holistic insights about and, in turn, improve the player experience. However, triangulating the different data sources and visualizing them in an integrated manner such that they contextualize each other still proves challenging. Despite its potential value for gauging player behaviour, this area of research continues to be underexplored. In this paper, we propose a visualization approach that combines commonly tracked movement data with - from a visualization perspective rarely considered - gaze behaviour and emotional responses. We evaluated our approach through a qualitative expert study with five professional game developers. Our results show that both the individual visualization of gaze, emotions, and movement but especially their combination are valuable to understand and form hypotheses about player behaviour. At the same time, our results stress that careful attention needs to be paid to ensure that the visualization remains legible and does not obfuscate information.\n",

      "One of the utilities of Virtual Reality is to provide its users with new perspectives, which is a promising application for architectural and interior design. In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying spatial scale perception (SSP), the perception of risks, and the ability to detect them in the virtual environment. We conducted a user study where participants experienced four unique perspectives, that of a two-year-old child, an eight-year-old child, an adult and a person in a wheelchair by manipulating their virtual inter-pupillary distance and eye height. We found that varying SSP had significant impacts on the perceived level of risk, heights of the identified risk, and the number of risks discovered. The results yielded empirical evidence to support that experiencing different SSP, can potentially help identify issues during an architectural design process for various groups of users.\n",

Given the high fragmentation and complexity of their work, staying focused on the relevant pieces of information can become quite challenging in today's window-based environments, especially with the ever increasing monitor screen-size. To support developers in staying focused, we conducted a formative study with 18 professionals in which we examined their computer based and eye-gaze interaction with the window environment and devised a relevance model of open windows. Based on the results, we developed a prototype to dim irrelevant windows and reduce distractions, and evaluated it in a user study. Our results indicate that our model was able to predict relevant open windows with high accuracy and participants felt that integrating visual prominence into the desktop environment reduces clutter and distraction, which results in reduced window switching and an increase in focus.\n",

      "Anonymous networks intended to enhance privacy and evade censorship are also being exploited for abusive activities. Technical schemes have been proposed to selectively revoke the anonymity of abusive users, or simply limit them from anonymously accessing online service providers. We designed an empirical survey study to assess the effects of deploying these schemes on 75 users of the Tor anonymous network. We evaluated proposed schemes based on examples of the intended or abusive use cases they may address, their technical implementation and the types of entities responsible for enforcing them. Our results show that revocable anonymity schemes would particularly deter the intended uses of anonymous networks. We found a lower reported decrease in usage for schemes addressing spam than those directly compromising free expression. However, participants were concerned that all technical mechanisms for addressing anonymous abuses could be exploited beyond their intended goals (51.7%) to harm users (43.8%). Participants were distrustful of the enforcing entities involved (43.8%) and concerned about being unable to verify (49.3%) how particular mechanisms were applied.\n",

      "Open Science Hardware (OScH) refers to open-source alternatives for proprietary scientific equipment. While the OScH movement aims to reduce barriers for scientific experimentation both in and beyond professional labs, disseminating OScH for widespread adoption proves to be challenging in practice. To this end, we examined real-world practices related to the dissemination of OScH through a two-part study. First, we developed an open science hardware, a DIY incubator, and disseminated it through the Instructables website and maker workshops. In parallel, we interviewed eight open science hardware practitioners from different parts of the world. Insights from interviews together with our own self-reflections revealed how different OScH dissemination modalities serve unique purposes. Our findings also reveal several challenges for widespread adoption of OScH and the importance of collaborations between OScH developers. We conclude by discussing the opportunities for HCI to lower barriers for customization, support internationalization of OScH, and scaffold proactive distributed collaborations between developers and users.\n",

      "There is widespread concern over the ways speech assistant providers currently use humans to listen to users' queries without their knowledge. We report two iterations of the TalkBack smart speaker, which transparently combines machine and human assistance. In the first, we created a prototype to investigate whether people would choose to forward their questions to a human answerer if the machine was unable to help. Longitudinal deployment revealed that most users would do so when given the explicit choice. In the second iteration we extended the prototype to draw upon spoken answers from previous deployments, combining machine efficiency with human richness. Deployment of this second iteration shows that this corpus can help provide relevant, human-created instant responses. We distil lessons learned for those developing conversational agents or other AI-infused systems about how to appropriately enlist human-in-the-loop information services to benefit users, task workers and system performance.\n",

The digital switch has come with many benefits such as lowering barriers, mobile work environments and mass production for distribution of work. Along with these benefits we also see challenges for art and design work and its future perception in society. As technology takes a more significant role in supporting art and design what will this mean for the individual artist or designer? The focus of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore what the future of digital art and design will hold.

Biases can be present in users, systems and their contents. With HCI being at the forefront of designing and developing user-facing computing systems, we bear special responsibility for increasing awareness of potential issues and working on solutions to mitigate problems arising from both intentional and unintentional effects of cognitive biases. This workshop brings together designers, developers, and thinkers across disciplines to redefine computing systems by focusing on inherent biases in people and systems and work towards a research agenda to mitigate their effects. By focusing on cognitive biases from content or system as well as from a human perspective, this workshop will sketch out blueprints for systems that contribute to advancing technology and media literacy, building critical thinking skills, and depolarization by design.\n",

However, the combination of automation and creativity also raises controversies and resistance in some user groups. This paper considers the case of software-generated visuals in live music performance and tries to make sense of the ambivalent response given by its intended users (i.e., DJs and VJs). We carried out seven face-to-face interviews, an online survey (N = 102) and 25 interviews at a distance to unravel DJs' and VJs' positions on automated visual software. Four core controversies were eventually identified, gravitating around the implications of using such software on DJs' and VJs' identities as artists and on their competitive advantage in their activity sector. The conclusions reconnect these findings with the larger issue of understanding the users' responses to automation.\n",

      "When new things, such as buildings or physical products, are designed, the design process typically explores multiple design alternatives and undergoes several iterations. The associated artefacts typically grow from low-fidelity prototypes, such as paper sketches, to high-fidelity prototypes, such as 3D scale models. While previous work has focused on capturing the design rationale behind the decisions that happen during such a design process, this information typically remains secluded and is not easily accessible for the stakeholders. In this paper, we explore how to augment both physical and digital designs with their associated design rationale and decisions. Our exploratory inquiry with three experts in architecture provides qualitative feedback on our augmented reality tool and concepts. We expect that these preliminary results are valuable for future traceability tools for physical and digital designs, even beyond the domain of architecture.\n",

A good non-visual representation should convey the interrelation of words and support the user in building a practical spatial image of the crossword grid. This paper looks at two approaches to representing a crossword puzzle for visually impaired users: a screen reader based crossword, and an audio-tactile crossword puzzle. We evaluate the designs in a study with 10 visually impaired participants. The audio-tactile representation was found to support the practical use of the crossword's spatial structure while the screen reader based puzzle leveraged participant's prior experience in navigating websites. The paper discusses critical aspects of our study and presents a perspective on the use of multimodal interfaces for such spatial applications.\n",

      "When signing up for new mobile apps, users are often provided the option of using their Facebook or other social media credentials (i.e., single sign-on services; SSO). While SSO is designed to make the login process more seamless and convenient, recent social media data breaches may give pause to users by raising security concerns about their online transactions. In particular, users logging into sensitive services, such as dating apps, may feel hesitant to adopt SSO due to perceived potential data leakage to their social networks. We tested this proposition through a user study (N = 364) and found that individual differences in online security perceptions predict the use of SSO for certain sensitive services (e.g., affair apps), but not others (e.g., matchmaking apps). Informed by theory, potential mediators of this relationship (perceived security, ease of sharing, and usability) were also explored, thus shedding light on psychologically salient drivers of SSO adoption.\n",

      "There is mounting evidence acknowledging that embodiment is foundational to cognition. In HCI, this understanding has been incorporated in concepts like embodied interaction, bodily play, and natural user-interfaces. However, while embodied cognition suggests a strong connection between motor activity and memory, we find the design of technological systems that target this connection to be largely overlooked. Considering this, we are provided with an opportunity to extend human capabilities through augmenting motor memory. Augmentation of motor memory is now possible with the advent of new and emerging technologies including neuromodulation, electric stimulation, brain-computer interfaces, and adaptive intelligent systems. This workshop aims to explore the possibility of augmenting motor memory using these and other technologies. In doing so, we stand to benefit not only from new technologies and interactions, but also a means to further study cognition.\n",

      "Conversational systems are inherently disadvantaged when indicating either what capabilities they have or the state they are in. The notion of habitability, the appropriate balancing in design between the language people use and the language a system can accept, emerged out of these early difficulties with conversational systems. This literature review aims to summarize progress in habitability research and explore implications for the design of current AI-enabled conversational systems. We found that i) the definitions of habitability focus mostly on matching between user expectations and system capabilities by employing well-balanced restrictions on language use; ii) there are two comprehensive design perspectives on different domains of habitability; iii) there is one standardized questionnaire with a sub-scale to measure habitability in a limited way. The review has allowed us to propose a working definition of habitability and some design implications that may prove useful for guiding future research and practice in this field.\n",

      "We present an identification method for 3D-printed objects that uses differences in inner structure patterns formed by printing conditions which we can configure in slicer software. Resonant properties change depending on the shape, material, and boundary conditions of the objects, so that our method identifies objects on the basis of differences in resonant properties caused by different inner structure patterns using a machine-learning algorithm. We measured resonant properties as frequency properties using active acoustic sensing. Our method is applicable to 3D-printed objects with a low filling rate while reducing the workload of modeling the inner structure to be used as a tag. To investigate the feasibility of our method, we conducted two experimental evaluations. The results of one showed that our method can identify eight objects with an average classification accuracy of 99.3%.\n",

      "This paper reports on the exploration of a tablet-based augmented reality (AR) application for use by occupational therapists (OTs). The application enables OTs to support individuals with physical impairment and disability when making home modifications. This is a necessary process that empowers these individuals to compensate for their reduced abilities and to maintain independent living. Through semi-structured interviews and a participatory workshop, current home modifications and the challenges involved in the process of implementation were investigated, and an AR prototype was co-designed with the OTs. They found the AR tool to be potentially beneficial as it allows them to search, find, and select assistive technologies (ATs) for use in homes and to demonstrate the home-modification plans to users. The tool will enable users to envision the most appropriate scenarios when purchasing and utilizing ATs in the home.\n",

To develop a better understanding of the experience of visitors with autism at the Canada Science and Technology Museum, we invited four school children and one adult male for a visit, all of whom identified as being on the spectrum. They were joined by their support persons. We interviewed the adult, his caregiver and the teaching staff accompanying the school children. We analyzed our interviews and observation notes using thematic analysis to formulate key findings and suggestions to enhance the experience for autistic people. They include adding elements at a variety of developmental levels, offering options to reduce sensory stimulation, improving navigational resources and providing more resources for support persons.\n",

      "International Graduate Students (IGS) are an integral part of the United States (US) higher education ecosystem. However, they face enormous challenges while transitioning to the US due to cultural shock, language barriers, and intense academic pressure. These issues can cause poor mental health, and in some cases, increased risk of self-harm. The relative ease of access and ubiquity of social technology have the potential for supporting IGS during socio-cultural transitions. However, little is known about how IGS use social technology for seeking support. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with the IGS in Western Massachusetts to understand how they seek social support. Our preliminary findings indicate that our participants preferred seeking informational and network support through social technology. They expressed that they preferred to seek emotional support in-person and from their close contacts but we found a latent pattern that shows they use technology passively (e.g, following others posts, comments, etc). We also found that over time, their support-seeking preference changes from people of similar ethnicity to people with similar experiences. Finally, we identified language as the primary barrier to actively seek any kind of support through technology.\n",

      "Biases in data, such as gender and racial stereotypes, are propagated through intelligent systems and amplified at end-user applications. Existing studies detect and quantify biases based on pre-defined attributes. However, in real practices, it is difficult to gather a comprehensive list of sensitive concepts for various categories of biases. We propose a general methodology to quantify dataset biases by measuring the difference of its data distribution with a reference dataset using Maximum Mean Discrepancy. For the case of natural language data, we show that lexicon-based features quantify explicit stereotypes, while deep learning-based features further capture implicit stereotypes represented by complex semantics. Our method provides a more flexible way to detect potential biases.\n",

With state-of-the-art hand-tracking technology, direct interaction and manipulation of levitating objects in 3D is now possible. Further, adding game-elements like completing simple tasks can encourage participant exploration of new technologies. We have therefore developed a gesture controlled levitating particle game, akin to the classic wire-loop game, that combines all these elements (levitation, hand-tracking, and gameplay) together with physical obstacles. Further, we have designed a gesture input set that constrains false triggering gestures and dropping of the levitating particle.\n",

      "Computer users commonly experience interaction anomalies, such as the text cursor jumping to another location in a document, perturbed mouse pointer motion, or a disagreement between tactile input and touch screen location. These anomalies impair interaction and require the user to take corrective measures, such as resetting the text cursor or correcting the trajectory of the pointer to reach a desired target. Impairments can result from software bugs, physical hardware defects, and extraneous input. However, some designs alter the course of interaction through covert impairments, anomalies introduced intentionally and without the user's knowledge. There are various motivations for doing so rooted in disparate fields including biometrics, electronic voting, and entertainment. We examine this kind of deception by systematizing four different ways computer interaction may become impaired and three different goals of the designer, providing insight to the design of systems that implement covert impairments.\n",

Parts of the display are hidden during interaction, which can lead to incorrect input. For simplicity, instead of general text input a small set of answer options are often provided, but these are limited and impersonal. In contrast, free-form drawings can answer messages in a very personal way, but are difficult to produce on small displays. To enable precise drawing input on smartwatches we present a magnetic stylus that is tracked on the back of the hand. In an evaluation of several algorithms we show that 3D position estimation with a 7.5x20mm magnet reaches a worst-case 6% relative position error on the back of the hand. Furthermore, the results of a user study are presented, which show that in the case of drawing applications the presented technique is faster and more precise than direct finger input.\n",

New functionality, called STIR/SHAKEN (S/S), hopes to help fix this issue by detecting whether a call is coming from the number it says it is. However, due to the nature of the system, at first only a portion of calls would go through the S/S system. This led us to question whether presenting this information would confuse users more than help. In this paper, we detail the results of online surveys, in-person interviews, and a lab-based simulation. The research recommends \"Valid Number\" for the label on the display and found that even with only 30% of calls being validated, S/S increased trust, answer frequency and consumer satisfaction. Based on these results, the launch of S/S could positively affect the current phone system and re-establish consumer trust.\n",

Our expectation was to find the highest amount of anthropomorphism for Q.bo One due to its humanoid shape, however, findings suggest that the life-likeness of the artifact is not pre-dominantly linked to the appearance, but to its interactivity and attributed agency and gender.\n",

      "Existing smart cane prototypes provide audio and/or haptic feedback to inform people who are blind or visually impaired about upcoming obstacles. However, limited user research is conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the haptic feedback provided by these devices. To better understand the users' perceptions of haptic feedback, we developed a smart cane prototype called Intelligent Mobility Cane (IMC) that consists of 2 haptic vibrators on the handle. They are used to inform different parts of the user's hand that an obstacle is detected. 8 people who are blind and 3 people who have low vision explored the IMC's handset by navigating an indoor obstacle path. The participants provided their feedback on the IMC's haptic notification system with regards to the intensity of the vibration and location of the vibrators and discussed various scenarios where the feedback will or will not be useful to them. In this case study, IMC handle design recommendations based on the participant's feedback and suggestions are presented.\n",

      "When we try to acquire moving targets such as shooting enemies in computer games, the shapes of these targets are often varied. Considering the effects of target shape in moving target selection is essential for predicting user performances such as error rate in user interfaces involving dynamic content. In this paper, we propose a model to be descriptive of the endpoint uncertainty in pointing of moving targets with arbitrary shapes. The model combines the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a Ternary-Gaussian model to describe the impacts of target shape and target motion on selection endpoints of moving targets. Compared to the-state-of-the-art, our model achieved higher performance in the fitting of endpoint distribution and predicting selection error rate.\n",

However, as this landscape is rapidly evolving year by year, what is urgently needed is for designers to speculate, ideate and design for emergent and near-future data trails. This one-day workshop will bring together a wide range of researchers, practitioners and designers working in areas such as smart cities, smart homes, responsible research & innovation, surveillance, privacy, IoT, smart energy and beyond, in order to ideate and design around emergent personal data trails.

However, having discussion and writing separated may result in a final document that has little connection to the discussion that came before. In this work, I build upon a hybrid discussion and document-writing tool called Wikum+ to allow groups to mix having discussions and summarizing those discussions in real-time, until the process results in a final document that incorporates and links all discussion points. I conduct a pilot study where a group used Wikum+ to collaboratively write a proposal, while a control group used a messaging platform along with Google Docs. From analyzing survey and interview results, I found preliminary evidence that Wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized as well as more inclusive of ideas in the final document. Wikum+ allowed for more light-weight coordination and iterative improvements through the incorporation of new ideas.\n",

      "Ray casting is frequently used to point and select distant targets in Virtual Reality (VR) systems. In this work, we evaluate user performance in 3D pointing with two different ray casting versions: infinite ray casting, where the cursor is positioned on the surface of the first object along the ray that said ray points at, and finite ray-casting, where the cursor is attached to the ray at a fixed distance from the controller. Twelve subjects performed a Fitts' law experiment where the targets were placed 1, 2, or 3 meters away from the user. According to the results, subjects were faster and made fewer errors with the infinite ray length. Interestingly, their (effective) pointing throughput was higher when the ray length was constrained. We illustrate the advantages of both methods in immersive VR applications and provide information for practitioners and developers to choose the most appropriate ray-casting-based selection method for VR.\n",

      "Graphical user web interfaces (GUIs) afford visual consumption and sensemaking of information, but present challenges for auditory, and often sequential, information seeking for people using screen readers. Information foraging theory illustrates that users' information behavior is guided by the use of information scent (mostly visual in GUIs) to assess value and cost of accessing information relevant to their goal, and rational decisions to maximize gain of information. Previous research about adaptive browsing behavior of screen reader users is associated with a lack of webpage usability. In this study, we observed and compared the information seeking behavior of ten sighted and ten screen reader users. Findings show that screen reader users demonstrate adapted mental models of the visual information search interface. Additionally, their adaptive search result exploration strategies in the context of query intent highlight key concern areas in specific parts of the search process.\n",

      "As the media landscape is increasingly populated by less than reputable sources of information, educators have turned to argument evaluation training as a potential solution. Unfortunately, the bias literature suggests that our ability to objectively evaluate an argument is, to a large extent, determined by the relationship between our own beliefs and the beliefs latent in the argument we are evaluating. If the argument supports our worldview, we are much more likely to overlook logical errors. Teachers recognize this need to adapt argument evaluation instruction to the specific beliefs of students. For instance, a teacher might intentionally assign a student an argument that the student disagrees with. Unfortunately, this kind of value-adaptive instruction is infrequent due to its unscalability. We propose a novel method for data-driven value-adaptive instruction in instructional technologies. This method can be used to combat bias in real-world contexts and support human reasoning during media consumption.\n",

It is morphable allowing users to sit in various ways. Also, our chair is equipped with two sensors, which collect data stream to distinguish four different states of the chair. Long-term sensor stream can be stored and used to refine the furniture. In this paper, we propose our concept, prototypes, sensing methods and results of experiments.

      "This paper introduces Glissade, a digital pen that generates balance shifting feedback by changing the weight distribution of the pen. A pulley system shifts a brass mass inside the pen to change the pen's center of mass and moment of inertia. When the mass is stationary, the pen delivers a constant yet natural sensation of weight, which can be used to convey a status. The pen can also generate a variety of haptic clues by actuating the mass according to the tilt or rotation of the pen, two commonly-used auxiliary pen input channels. Glissade demonstrates new possibilities that balance shifting feedback can bring to digital pen interactions. We validated the usability of this feedback by determining the recognizability of six balance patterns – a mix of static and dynamic patterns chosen based on our design considerations – in two controlled experiments. The results show that, on average, the participants could distinguish between the patterns with a 94.25% accuracy. At the end, we demonstrate a set of novel interactions enabled by Glissade and discuss the directions for future research.\n",

In two perception studies, we estimated the perception threshold on undetectable slow motions and displacement during an eye blink. In a formative study, we compared users' performance, posture change as well as subjective responses on unobtrusive, swift, and no motions. Based on the result, we designed concept applications and explored potential design space of moving virtual content for unobtrusive posture change.

      "Mobile vocabulary learning interfaces typically present material only in auditory and visual channels, underutilizing the haptic modality. We explored haptic-integrated learning by adding free-form digital annotation to mobile vocabulary learning interfaces. Through a series of pilot studies, we identified three design factors: annotation mode, presentation sequence, and vibrotactile feedback, that influence recall in haptic-integrated vocabulary interfaces. These factors were then evaluated in a within-subject comparative study using a digital flashcard interface as baseline. Results using a 84-item vocabulary showed that the 'whole word' annotation mode is highly effective, yielding a 24.21% increase in immediate recall scores and a 30.36% increase in the 7-day delayed scores. Effects of presentation sequence and vibrotactile feedback were more transient; they affected the results of immediate tests, but not the delayed tests. We discuss the implications of these factors for designing future mobile learning applications.\n",

      "The ScanAllFish project is a large-scale effort to scan all the world's 33,100 known species of fishes. It has already generated thousands of volumetric CT scans of fish species which are available on open access platforms such as the Open Science Framework. To achieve a scanning rate required for a project of this magnitude, many specimens are grouped together into a single tube and scanned all at once. The resulting data contain many fish which are often bent and twisted to fit into the scanner. Our system, Unwind, is a novel interactive visualization and processing tool which extracts, unbends, and untwists volumetric images of fish with minimal user interaction. Our approach enables scientists to interactively unwarp these volumes to remove the undesired torque and bending using a piecewise-linear skeleton extracted by averaging isosurfaces of a harmonic function connecting the head and tail of each fish. The result is a volumetric dataset of a individual, straight fish in a canonical pose defined by the marine biologist expert user. We have developed Unwind in collaboration with a team of marine biologists: Our system has been deployed in their labs, and is presently being used for dataset construction, biomechanical analysis, and the generation of figures for scientific publication.\n",

      "Software agents with truly human-level intelligence may be years or decades away - or a practical impossibility. Yet from an end-user perspective, we already live in an era of seemingly sentient agents. Virtual personal assistants are now ubiquitous on mobile and smart home devices. But as long as human-level artificial intelligence remains speculative, the ability of today's pseudo-sentient agents to understand and fulfill the full range of human user demands is, by definition, limited and failure-prone. We need better strategies for designing natural, graceful, failure-tolerant user experiences with pseudo-sentient agents. To better support researchers and practitioners actively working on this problem, we propose a Special Interest Group at CHI 2020: a pop-up studio to design the near-future of user interactions with pseudo-sentient agents.\n",

With the advancement of 3D fabrication (and future potential for actuated displays,) more installations opt to project geo-visualization data on physical objects to provide an additional layer of context. In this paper, we set out to compare the effectiveness and user engagement of geo-visualizations data projected on either a flat 2D surface or a 3D representation of the terrain. We present our methodology and observations from this study. Our results so far are inconclusive, which leads us the propose that physical geo-visualization is a thriving field for further research.\n",

      "This paper explores the disruptive and transformative effects of digital technology on gendered security asymmetries in Greenland. Through ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Greenland and Denmark, research findings emerged through in-depth interviews, collaborative mappings and field observations with 51 participants. Employing a critical feminist lens, the paper identifies how Greenlandic women develop digital security practices to respond to Greenland's ecologically, politically and socially induced transformation processes. By connecting individual security concerns of Greenlandic women with the broader regional context, the findings highlight how digital technology has created transitory spaces in which collective security is cultivated, shaped and challenged. The contribution to HCI scholarship is therefore threefold: (1) identification and acknowledgement of gendered effects of increased usage of digital technology in remote and hard-to-reach communities, (2) a broader conceptualisation of digital security and (3) a recommendation for more contextualised, pluralistic digitalisation policies and design.\n",

In this study, we examined pronunciation improvements, child engagement over time, and caregiver evaluation performance while using our game. We recruited ten children to play Apraxia World at home during two four-week treatment blocks, separated by a two-week break; nine of ten have completed the protocol at time of writing. In the treatment blocks, children's utterances were evaluated either by caregivers or an automated pronunciation framework. Preliminary analysis suggests that children made significant therapy gains with Apraxia World, even though caregivers evaluated pronunciation leniently. We also collected a corpus of child speech for offline examination. We will conduct additional analysis once all participants complete the protocol.\n",

      "HCI research on mobility and transport has been dominated by a focus on the automobile. Yet urgent environmental concerns, along with new transport technologies, have created an opportunity for new ways of thinking about how we get from A to B. App-based services, innovations in electric motors, along with changing urban transport patterns, are transforming public transit. Technology is creating new collective transit services, as well as new ways for individuals to move, such as through rental, free-floating e-scooters, so called 'micro-mobility'. This workshop seeks to discuss and establish HCI perspectives on these new mobilities - engaging with and even inventing new modes of transport, fostering collaboration between scholars with varied topical interests around mobility. We seek to bring together a group of industry and academic collaborators, bringing new competences to HCI around the exciting opportunities of redesigning our contemporary mobilities.\n",
