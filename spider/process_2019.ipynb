      "Early childhood developmental screening is critical for timely detection and intervention. babyTRACKS (Formerly Baby CROINC, CROwd INtelligence Curation.) is a free, live, interactive developmental tracking mobile app with over 3,000 children's diaries. Parents write or select short milestone texts, like \"began taking first steps,\" to record their babies' developmental achievements, and receive crowd-based percentiles to evaluate development and catch potential delays. Currently, an expert-based Curated Crowd Intelligence (CCI) process manually groups incoming novel parent-authored milestone texts according to their similarity to existing milestones in the database (for example, starting to walk), or determining that the milestone represents a new developmental concept not seen before in another child's diary. CCI cannot scale well, however, and babyTRACKS is mature enough, with a rich enough database of existing milestone texts, to now consider machine learning tools to replace or assist the human curators. Three new studies explore (1) the usefulness of automation, by analyzing the human cost of CCI and how the work is currently broken down; (2) the validity of automation, by testing the inter-rater reliability of curators; and (3) the value of automation, by appraising the \"real world\" clinical value of milestones when assessing child development. We conclude that automation can indeed be appropriate and helpful for a large percentage, though not all, of CCI work. We further establish realistic upper bounds for algorithm performance; confirm that the babyTRACKS milestones dataset is valid for training and testing purposes; and verify that it represents clinically meaningful developmental information.\n",

      "The current Indian education system promotes competition among students, emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence, students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result, a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge, the internet, causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed, we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.\n",

To gain a better understanding of user psychology behind the acceptance of automation in clinics, a 3 (Role: Receptionist, Nurse, Doctor) x 3 (Digital Agent Representation: Human, Avatar, Robot) factorial experiment (N = 283) was conducted. Results suggest that the digital nature of the interaction overpowers any individual role effects, with acceptance depending upon individual traits (belief in machine heuristic; power usage).

      "We propose a DIY process to produce customized paper keyboards with kinesthetic feedback that interact with touchscreens. The process is built using two techniques: kirigami and printable double-layered circuits. Our goal is to improve the extensibility and usability of various interfaces made with 2D paper substrates. First, Our kirigami structures provide kinesthetic sensations whose z-directional key stroke is comparable to that of traditional keyboards. In order to design keys with appropriate stroke and reaction force, we adopted the Rotational Erection System (RES). Second, printable double-layered circuits allow users to easily adjust input layouts. This easy-to-customize keyboard can be especially useful for those who have specific requirements for input devices.\n",

      "When designing comfort and usability in products, designers need to evaluate aspects ranging from anthropometrics to use scenarios. Therefore, virtual and poseable mannequins are employed as a reference in early-stage tools and for evaluation in the later stages. However, tools to intuitively interact with virtual humans are lacking. In this paper, we introduceSmartManikin, a mannequin with agency that responds to high-level commands and to real-time design changes. We first captured human poses with respect to desk configurations, identified key features of the pose and trained regression functions to estimate the optimal features at a given desk setup. The SmartManikin's pose is generated by the predicted features as well as by using forward and inverse kinematics. We present our design, implementation, and an evaluation with expert designers. The results revealed that SmartManikin enhances the design experience by providing feedback concerning comfort and health in real time.\n",

      "Split keyboards are widely used on hand-held touchscreen devices (e.g., tablets). However, typing on a split keyboard often requires eye movement and attention switching between two halves of the keyboard, which slows users down and increases fatigue. We explore peripheral typing, a superior typing mode in which a user focuses her visual attention on the output text and keeps the split keyboard in peripheral vision. Our investigation showed that peripheral typing reduced attention switching, enhanced user experience and increased overall performance (27 WPM, 28% faster) over the typical eyes-on typing mode. This typing mode can be well supported by accounting the typing behavior in statistical decoding. Based on our study results, we have designed GlanceType, a text entry system that supported both peripheral and eyes-on typing modes for real typing scenario. Our evaluation showed that peripheral typing not only well co-existed with the existing eyes-on typing, but also substantially improved the text entry performance. Overall, peripheral typing is a promising typing mode and supporting it would significantly improve the text entry performance on a split keyboard.\n",

      "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is also characterized by its motor fluctuations throughout the day. This makes clinical assessment to be hard to accomplish in an appointment as the patient status at the time may be largely different from his condition two hours before. Clinicians can only evaluate patients from time to time, making symptom fluctuations difficult to discern. The emergence of wearable sensors enabled the continuous monitoring of patients out of the clinic, in a free-living environment. Although, these sensors exist and they are being explored in a research setting, there have been limited efforts in understanding which information and how it should be presented to non-technical people, clinicians (and patients). To fill this gap, we started by performing a focus group with clinicians to capture the information they would like to see devised from free-living sensors, and the different levels of detail they envision. Building on the insights collected, we developed a data-driven platform, DataPark, that presents usable visualizations of data collected from a wearable tri-axial accelerometer. It enables report parameterization and includes a battery of state-of-the-art algorithms to quantify physical activity, sleep, and clinical evaluations. A two-month preliminary deployment in a rehabilitation clinic showed that patients feel rewarded and included by receiving a report, and that the change in paradigm is not burdensome and adds information for clinicians to support their decisions.\n",

      "Game designers use a variety of techniques that mislead players with the goal of inducing play experience. For example, designers may manipulate data displays of player health-showing they have less health than they actually do-to induce tension. While commonly used, players make decisions based on in-game data displays, raising the question of how misrepresentations impact behavior and performance, and whether this might have unintended consequences. To provide a better understanding of how data misrepresentation impacts play, we compare two versions of a game: one that displays health accurately and one that misrepresents health. Our results suggest that even subtle manipulations to data displays can have a measurable effect on behavior and performance, and these changes can help explain differences in experience. We show that data misrepresentations need to be designed carefully to avoid unintended effects. Our work provides new directions for research into the design of misrepresentation in games.\n",

      "Researchers have designed technologies for and with older adults to help them age in place, but there is an opportunity to support older adults in creating customized smart devices for themselves through electronic toolkits. We developed a plan for iterating on Craftec - one of the first electronic toolkits designed for older adults - informed by the results of a participatory design workshop and user evaluation. We focused on supporting older adults to create exemplar artifacts, such as medication adherence systems. We contribute the exemplars and the current plan for components of the Craftec system as a way to support older adults to design technology for themselves.\n",

      "We propose a new text layout that facilitates reading comprehension. By sequentially fading out characters sentence-by-sentence from the beginning of each paragraph, we highlight the paragraph structure of the entire text and the relative positions of the sentences. To evaluate the effectiveness of the paragraph-based faded text in a reading comprehension, we measure the comprehension, eye movements, and recognition for both the proposed method and a conventional standard method. In the proposed method, rates of correct answers to text comprehension questions are improved. Moreover, the proposed method leads to slower reading speeds and better recognition rates for the first sentences of paragraphs, which are displayed in a relatively thicker mode. With the paragraph-based faded text, the reader is naturally facilitated to pay attention to the first sentence of each paragraph, suggesting that this reading style could result in a more accurate text comprehension.\n",

      "In this paper, we propose the integration of audience atmosphere generation techniques into Interactive Storytelling (IS) engines to obtain more realistic and variable Virtual Reality (VR) training systems. We outline a number of advantages of this novel combination compared to current atmosphere generation techniques. The features of recent IS engines can be extended to automatically adapt the atmosphere produced by a group of virtual humans in response to user intervention while staying coherent with the unfolding story of the training scenario. This work is currently being developed in the context of a VR training for teachers, in which they learn to manage a difficult classroom under the guidance of an instructor.\n",

      "My research introduces expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other's psychological states. My prior work has shown the potential for these cues to provide authentic and validating emotional expression, while fostering awareness and social connection between people. In my proposed research, I expand on this work by exploring how social responses to biosignals can benefit communication through empathy-building and social support. This work will scope the design space for expressive biosignals and inform future interventions for a variety of social contexts, including interpersonal relationships and mental health.\n",

      "Parents receive conflicting information on the benefits and burdens of children's technology use, especially novel technologies such as digital home assistants. To understand parents' views, we analyzed relevant Amazon Echo device product reviews posted to Amazon.com, and deployed a User Benefit and Burden Survey to 131 parents on Amazon Mechanical Turk to explore their perspectives of Amazon Echo digital home assistants. Our work explores parents' perceptions of the devices with regards to their children and families, in terms of attributes such as benefits and burdens. This study contributes an empirical, family-centered understanding of and design opportunities for whole home personal assistants in support of a diversity of families.\n",

      "In HCI, the honeypot effect describes a form of audience engagement in which a person's interaction with a technology stimulates passers-by to observe, approach and engage in an interaction themselves. In this paper we explore the potential for honeypot effects to arise in the use of mobile augmented reality (AR) applications in urban spaces. We present an observational study of Santa's Lil Helper, a mobile AR game that created a Christmas-themed treasure hunt in a metropolitan area. Our study supports a consideration of three factors that may impede the honeypot effect: the presence of people in relation to the game and its interactive components; the visibility of gameplay in urban space; and the extent to which the game permits a shared experience. We consider how these factors can inform the design of future AR experiences that are capable of stimulating honeypot effects in public space.\n",

      "Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3], the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore, existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges, such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead, they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI, head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper, we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7], which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely, we consider individuals with wheelchairs, the assistive technology research community, and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors, healthcare professionals, and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews, surveys, demonstrations, and continuous user inputs, aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety, accessibility, and a durable design. Guided by these results, we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.\n",

      "When a non-native speaker talks with a native speaker, he/she sometimes feels hard to take speaking turns due to language proficiency. The resulting conversation between a non-native speaker and a native speaker is not always productive. In this paper, we propose a conversational agent to support a non-native speaker in his/her second language conversation. The agent joins the conversation and makes intervention by a simple script based on turn-taking rules for taking the agent's turn, and gives the next turn to the non-native speaker for prompting him/her to speak. Evaluation of the proposed agent suggested that it successfully facilitated the non-native speaker's participation over 30% of the agent's interventions, and significantly increased the frequency of turn-taking.\n",

      "We report on the design and implementation of a 3-week long summer academy introducing high school students to 3D modeling and 3D printing experiences. Supporting youth in developing 3D modeling knowledge can enhance their capacity to effectively use an array of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and digital fabrication. We used tools and practices from both formal and informal education, such as storylining, to inform the design of the curriculum. We collected data through surveys, artifacts, observations, screen recordings, and group videos. Our findings suggest that (1) emphasizing curricular coherence as a design goal and (2) providing youth with multiple avenues for engaging in 3D modeling can help to: spark youth interest in 3D printing/modeling, maintain youth engagement in learning activities over the course of several weeks, and provide youth with opportunities to develop their spatial thinking skills.\n",

      "This work investigates classification of emotions from MoCap full-body data by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Rather than addressing regular day to day activities, we focus on a more complex type of full-body movement - dance. For this purpose, a new dataset was created which contains short excerpts of the performances of professional dancers who interpreted four emotional states: anger, happiness, sadness, and insecurity. Fourteen minutes of motion capture data are used to explore different CNN architectures and data representations. The results of the four-class classification task are up to 0.79 (F1 score) on test data of other performances by the same dancers. Hence, through deep learning, this paper proposes a novel and effective method of emotion classification, which can be exploited in affective interfaces.\n",

      "The electrocardiogram (ECG), a graphical representation of the heart's electrical activity, is used for detecting cardiac pathologies. Certain medications can produce a complication known as 'long QT syndrome', shown on the ECG as an increased gap between two parts of the waveform. Self-monitoring for this could be lifesaving, as the syndrome can result in sudden death, but detecting it on the ECG is difficult. Here we evaluate whether using pseudo-colour to highlight wave length and changing the coordinate system can support lay people in identifying increases in the QT interval. The results show that introducing colour significantly improves accuracy, and that whilst it is easier to detect a difference without colour with Cartesian coordinates, the greatest accuracy is achieved when Polar coordinates are combined with colour. The results show that applying simple visualisation techniques has the potential to improve ECG interpretation accuracy, and support people in monitoring their own ECG.\n",

      "Many traditional HCI methods, such as surveys and interviews, are of limited value when working with preschoolers. In this paper, we present anchored audio sampling (AAS), a remote data collection technique for extracting qualitative audio samples during field deployments with young children. AAS offers a developmentally sensitive way of understanding how children make sense of technology and situates their use in the larger context of daily life. AAS is defined by an anchor event, around which audio is collected. A sliding window surrounding this anchor captures both antecedent and ensuing recording, providing the researcher insight into the activities that led up to the event of interest as well as those that followed. We present themes from three deployments that leverage this technique. Based on our experiences using AAS, we have also developed a reusable open-source library for embedding AAS into any Android application.\n",

      "Interactive spherical displays offer unique educational and entertainment opportunities for both children and adults in public spaces. However, designing interfaces for spherical displays remains difficult because we do not yet fully understand how users naturally interact with and collaborate around spherical displays. This paper reports current progress on a project to understand how children (ages 8 to 13) and adults interact with spherical displays in a real-world setting. Our initial data gathering includes an exploratory study in which children and adults interacted with a prototype application on a spherical display in small groups in a public setting. We observed that child groups tended to interact more independently around the spherical display, whereas adult groups interacted with the sphere in a driver-navigator mode and did not tend to walk around the sphere. This work will lay the groundwork for future research into designing interactive applications for spherical displays tailored towards users of all age groups.\n",

      "Medical images contain important information for diagnosis and preoperative planning in modern medicine. Interacting with these images still happens mostly with a mouse, abstract gestures or handles. In a focus group with five surgeons, we evaluate the possibilities of 3D printed organ models for interaction in VR for the use case of surgery planning. The surgeons rate the approach as highly useful and highlighted the advantage of easier grasping the space relations, which would greatly improve the planning phase of surgery.\n",

      "Understanding users' perceptions of suspected computer-security problems can help us tailor technology to better protect users. To this end, we conducted a field study of users' perceptions using 189,272 problem descriptions sent to the customer-support desk of a large anti-virus vendor from 2015 to 2018. Using qualitative methods, we analyzed 650 problem descriptions to study the security issues users faced and the symptoms that led users to their own diagnoses. Subsequently, we investigated to what extent and for what types of issues user diagnoses matched those of experts. We found, for example, that users and experts were likely to agree for most issues, but not for attacks (e.g., malware infections), for which they agreed only in 44% of the cases. Our findings inform several user-security improvements, including how to automate interactions with users to resolve issues and to better communicate issues to users.\n",

      "Caregiving to a person with Alzheimer's can be a very demanding task, both from physical and psychological perspectives. Technological responses to support caregiving, and improve the quality of life of people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers are lacking. Using a research through design approach, we devised a robot focused on empowering people with Alzheimer and fostering their autonomy, from the initial sketch to a working prototype. MATY is a robot that encourages communication with relatives and promotes routines by eliciting the person to take action, using a multisensorial approach (e.g., projecting biographical images, playing suggestive sounds, or emitting soothing aromas). The paper reports the iterative, incremental design process performed together with stakeholders. We share first lessons learned in this process with HCI researchers and practitioners designing solutions, particularly robots, to assist people with dementia and their caregivers.\n",

      "We present a method we propose called FabAuth for identifying 3D-printed objects, which utilizes the differences in the resonant properties of such objects. We focus on changing the internal structures of each object made through a 3D printing process to assign a unique resonant property to it even if multiple objects have the same appearance. To identify the objects, the method identifies resonant property differences by using vibration that can pass through 3D-printed objects. The method can be applied even to low-filled 3D-printed objects as long as an acoustic wave can travel through the objects from one sensor to another. To validate the method's feasibility, we conducted a preliminary experiment to confirm whether it can be applied to low-filled 3D-printed objects and found that its average classification accuracy reached 92.2%.\n",

      "This paper explores teachers' expected and perceived gains from classroom participation in design projects. The results indicate that teachers hope the experience will be fun for the children, and that it will increase both children's and their own knowledge about technology. Although they consider learning goals important, these do not necessarily have to be communicated to the children, since the teachers experience that the children are learning several skills anyway. However, early involvement in the definition of learning goals could make participation more beneficial. The teachers also see several gains from partication for themselves, especially related to using a design approach in the classroom. We discuss the implications of these finding and suggest a way to increase the user gains for both children and teachers by considering the opportunity to use classroom participation as a way to support teachers' competence development, thereby fulfilling the promise of mutual learning as advocated in Participatory Design.\n",

      "As the distinctions of formation structure between Chinese and Western languages, learners take more effort in grasping correct formation structure and pronunciation when they are studying Chinese character. Various Chinese character learning systems have already been proposed in order to help the learners recognize the character, but ignore its handwriting and cultural background. We here present a learning system for learners to study Chinese character better. To increase the effectiveness in learning Chinese character, we combine pronunciation and character writing with the integrated use of computer, projector and camera in this design. This system eases the learners to understand the meaning, cultural background and formation structure of character by using the morphological and phonetic animation projection and handwriting instruction. In comparison with screen-writing systems, this system provides a more authentic learning experience for learners through simulating the learning process of writing on real paper. We anticipate our system to be a starting point to explore the instruction in Chinese character in the field of its formation structure, pronunciation and handwriting, and to be used in the classroom or at home in the future.\n",

      "The way information systems are designed has a crucial effect on users' privacy, but users are rarely involved in Privacy-by-Design processes. To bridge this gap, we investigate how User-Centered Design (UCD) methods can be used to improve the privacy of systems' designs. We present the process of developing A/P(rivacy) Testing, a platform that allows designers to compare several privacy designs alternatives, eliciting end-users' privacy perceptions of a tested system or a feature (Figure 1). We describe three online experiments, with 959 participants, in which we created and validated the reliability of a scale for Users' Perceived Systems' Privacy (UPSP), and used it to compare between privacy designs alternatives by using scenarios and different variants. We show that A/B testing is applicable for privacy purposes and that our scale is differentiating between designs that perceived as legitimate and designs that may violate users' expectations.\n",

      "We have recently seen the emergence of new platforms that aim to provide remotely located entrepreneurs and startup companies with support analogous to that found within traditional incubation or acceleration spaces. This paper offers an understanding of these 'virtual hubs', and the inherently socio-technical interactions that occur between their members. Our study analyzes a sample of existing virtual hubs in two stages. First, we contribute broader insight into the current landscape of virtual hubs by documenting and categorizing 25 hubs regarding their form, support offered and a selection of further qualities. Second, we contribute detailed insight into the operation and experience of such hubs, from an analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews with organizers and participants of virtual hubs. We conclude by analyzing our findings in terms of relational aspects of non-virtual hubs from the literature and remediation theory, and propose opportunities for advancing the design of such platforms.\n",

This study highlights our attempt to create a new notification rule to reduce this crowdedness, which can be recognized by both senders and recipients. We developed an MIM app that provides only one notification per conversation session, which is a group of consecutive messages distinguished based on a ten-minute silence period. Through the two-week field study, 20,957 message logs and interview data from 17 participants revealed that MIM notifications affect not only the recipients' experiences before opening the app but also the entire conversation experience, including that of the senders. The new notification rule created new social norms for the participants' use of MIM. We report themes about the changes in the MIM experience, which will expand the role of notifications for future MIM apps.\n",

      "We present VibEye: a vibration-mediated recognition system of objects for tangible interaction. A user holds an object between two fingers wearing VibEye. VibEye triggers a vibration from one finger, and the vibration that has propagated through the object is sensed at the other finger. This vibration includes information about the object's identity, and we represent it using a spectrogram. Collecting the spectrograms of many objects, we formulate the object recognition problem to a classical classification problem among the images. This simple method, when tested with 20 users, shows 92.5% accuracy for 16 objects of the same shape with various materials. This material-based classifier is also extended to the recognition of everyday objects. Lastly, we demonstrate several tangible applications where VibEye provides the needed functionality while enhancing user experiences. VibEye is particularly effective for recognizing objects made of different materials, which is difficult to distinguish by other means such as light and sound.\n",

      "While learning science research has explored approaches improving students' problem solving skills by introducing tools that support students in metacognitive reflection, this work has focused on problems with clear solutions, rather than addressing the question of how metacognitive reflection can help students develop their self-regulation skills, which help students understand and control their learning environment through planning, practice, and self-evaluation. This paper presents Muse, an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) program, which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.\n",

While tactile cues based on vibration may indicate direction, they do not convey the direction of movement. We would like to propose the use of inflatables as an alternative form of actuation to express such information through pressure. Inspired by notions from embodied interaction and somaesthetic design, we present in this paper a research through design (RtD) project that substitutes directional metaphors with push against the body. The result, Flow, is a wearable designed to cue six movements of the wrist/forearm to support the training of elementary sensory-motor skills of physical activities, such as foil fencing. We contribute with the description of the design process and reflections on how to design for tactile motion instructions through inflatables.\n",

      "If social, economic and environmental sustainability are linked, then support for the increasing number of non-profit groups and member-owned organizations offering what Trebor Scholz has called \"platform cooperativism\" [17] has never been more important. Together, these organizations not only tackle issues their members identify in the world of work, but also provide network-driven collections of shared things (e.g., books, tools) and resources (e.g., woodworking spaces, fab labs) that benefit local communities, potentially changing, not just use of resources at community level, but socio-economic structures on the ground (e.g., [15]). In contrast to for-profit services often associated with the sharing economy (e.g., Uber, Airbnb), platform co-ops attempt to advocate ecological, economic and social sustainability, with the goal to promoting a fairer distribution of goods and labor, ultimately creating a stronger sense of community. While some HCI sub-communities (e.g., CSCW) have started to explore this emergent phenomenon, especially leveraging ethnographic research methods, researchers have called for more diverse HCI approaches to address the growing scope of challenges within platform co-ops, member-driven exchange systems, and cooperativism more broadly. This SIG aims to bring together researchers from different HCI sub-communities to identify future research directions in HCI around cooperativism and platforms.\n",

      "Room-scale virtual reality games allow players to experience an unmatched level of presence. A major reason is the natural navigation provided by physical walking. However, the tracking space is still limited, and viable alternatives or extensions are required to reach further virtual destinations. Our current work focuses on traveling over (very) large distances--an area where approaches such as teleportation are too exhausting and WIM teleportations potentially reduce presence. Our idea is to equip players with the ability to switch from first-person to a third-person god-mode perspective on demand. From above, players can command their avatar similar to a real-time strategy game and initiate travels over large distance. In our first exploratory evaluation, we learned that the proposed dynamic switching is intuitive, increases spatial orientation, and allows players to maintain a high degree of presence throughout the game. Based on the outcomes of a participatory design workshop, we also propose a set of extensions to our technique that should be considered in the future.\n",

      "Leaderboards are a workhorse of the gamification literature. While the effect of a leaderboard has been well studied, there is much less evidence how one's peer group affects the treatment effect of a leaderboard. Through a pre-registered field experiment involving more than 1000 users on an online movie recommender website, we expose users to leaderboards, but different sets of users are exposed to different peer groups. Contrary to what a standard behavioral model would predict, we find that a user's contribution increases when their peer's scores are more dispersed. We also find that decreasing average peer contributions motivates a user to contribute more. Moreover, these effects are themselves mediated by group size. This sheds new light on existing theories of motivation and demotivation with regards to leaderboards, and also illustrates the potential of using personalized leaderboards to increase contributions.\n",

      "Involving end-users is considered key to successful design of technology. It can be challenging, however to involve end-users when designing healthcare technology, due to the limited availability of patients because of their condition or treatment. This is especially difficult when co-designing healthcare technology, which often requires several end-users to collaborate in group activities such as ideation exercises and brainstorms. In an exploration of co-design methods that do not require participants to be co-located, this paper describes initial results from a small-scale ideation workshop in the context of fertility treatment. Preliminary data analysis suggests that user-generated card-based ideation could be used to inspire ideation while transferring knowledge and ideas between participants who are not co-located. This approach could benefit researchers in several healthcare technology settings that use co-design, and other domains where availability of participants is limited.\n",

There are, however, other ways to provide users with motivation or meaning during normal computer interactions, such as using emotional reinforcement. This could provide a powerful new tool to allow the positive effects of gamification to reach wider contexts. This paper investigates the design and evaluation of a mobile to-do list application, 'Tamu To-Do', which utilises gamified emotional reinforcement, as seen in Figure 1. A week-long field study (N=9) recorded user activity and impressions with the application. The results supported emotional reinforcement's potential as a gamification strategy to improve user motivation and engagement.\n",

The paper more specifically proposed a method to extract diverse perspectives (called views) from experimental data. The current paper provides three improvements of this existing method by: 1) showing that a little-known approach for clustering attributes, called VARCLUS, can be applied and extended to provide a more optimal algorithm, 2) showing how the VARCLUS method can be applied to perform both within- and across-subject analysis, and 3) providing access to the VARCLUS method by incorporating it in ILLMO, a user-friendly and freely available program for interactive statistics.\n",

Such areas are difficult to estimate and standing in one may have consequences for worker safety and for the productivity of the robot. We investigate the use of multimodal (auditory and/or visual) head-mounted AR displays to warn about entering hazard zones while performing an independent navigation task. As a first step in this research, we report a design-research study (including a user study), conducted to obtain a visual and an auditory AR display subjectively judged to approach equivalence.

This paper presents design and experimental implications when evolving from prior simulator to on-road scenarios. We ran a controlled study (N=40) testing a haptic guided breathing system in a closed circuit under stress and not-stressed driving conditions. Preliminary results validate prior findings about the efficacy and safety of the intervention. Initial qualitative analysis shows an overall positive acceptance, and no safety-critical incidents (e.g., hard brakes or severe lane departures) -- all participants graded the intervention as safe for real traffic applications. Going further, additional analysis is needed before exposing commuters to the intervention on public roads.\n",

While gestures provide users with advantages to express themselves, they also introduce challenges regarding accuracy and memorability. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a gesture's orientation on how well the gesture can be performed. We conducted a study in which participants performed systematically rotated unistroke gestures. For straight lines as well as for compound lines, we found that users tend to align gestures with the primary axes. We show that the error can be described by a Clausen function with R² = .93. Based on our findings, we suggest design implications and highlight the potential for recognizing flick gestures, visualizing gestures and improving recognition of compound gestures.\n",

      "Email is an essential tool for communication and social interaction. It also functions as a broadcast medium connecting businesses with their customers, as an authentication mechanism, and as a vector for scams and security threats. These uses are enabled by the fact that the only barrier to reaching someone by email is knowing his or her email address. This feature has given rise to the spam email industry but also has another side-effect that is becoming increasingly common: misdirected email, or legitimate emails that are intended for somebody else but are sent to the wrong recipient. In this paper we present findings from an interview study and survey focusing on characteristics of misdirected email messages, possible reasons why they happen, and how people manage these messages when they receive them. Misdirected email arises as a result of signifiers (usernames) which were selected by people for social and self-representation purposes, that are also used by machines for addressing. Because there is no mechanism for dealing with misdirected emails in a systematic way, individual recipients must choose whether to take action and how much effort to put forth to prevent potential negative consequences for themselves and others.\n",

      "Since its inception in the early 1980's, HCI and UX have sought wider recognition and influence. Now digital transformation, a pervasive shift in the role of information technology, will offer both practitioners and researchers far more influential roles in organizations. This shift, which is taking place in industry, education and government is part of a larger shift to a global, digitally connected society. This panel builds on the theme of CHI'19 - Weaving the Threads - through its focus on how HCI/UX, research and practice will be integrated as organizations transform into digitally-driven entities. The panel brings together thought leaders with backgrounds in both academia and industry. With extensive audience participation, we will explore the implications of digital transformation on the roles of HCI/UX, the challenges, and the new skills needed to support a culture change and collaborate with a wider range of stakeholders. It is our hope that this panel can become a jumping off point for future work, built on our belief that HCI/UX are vital drivers of new technologies, and of beneficial societal transformations. Through national agencies and, perhaps in time, becoming part of the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda, would position HCI/UX to fulfill its role as a key driver of both business and social transformation.\n",

SIIDs are a great concern when considering the ubiquitousness of technology in a wide range of contexts. Considering our daily reliance on technology, and mobile technology in particular, it is increasingly important that we fully understand and model how SIIDs occur. Similarly, we must identify appropriate methods for sensing and adapting technology to reduce the effects of SIIDs. In this workshop, we will bring together researchers working on understanding, sensing, modelling, and adapting technologies to ameliorate the effects of SIIDs. This workshop will provide a venue to identify existing research gaps, new directions for future research, and opportunities for future collaboration.\n",

      "The design of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) has mostly focused on applications for adults, but VUIs provide potential advantages to young children in enabling concurrent interactions with the physical and social world. Current applications for young children focus on media playing, answering questions, and highly-structured activities. There is an opportunity to go beyond these applications by using VUIs to support high-quality, creative social play. In this paper, we describe our first step in pursuing this opportunity with 24 design sessions guided by a partnership with eight 3 to 4 year old children. In a social play setting, we learned that children wanted to physically interact with the voice agents and VUIs could redirect behaviors and promote social interactions.\n",

      "Co-located games that bring players together have strong potential for supporting children's collaborative competencies. However, there is a challenge how to make results from research work related to this within Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) field easily transferable to future CCI research. Pursuing this challenge, we combined levels of Collaborative Activity (CA) with the design tool gameplay design patterns (GDPs). This combination was used to support comparative play tests of a co-located game with children who have learning difficulties. We report our observations on using our approach, arguing that the possibility of making patterns based on CA concepts such as Reflective Communication points towards collaborative GDPs. Furthermore, this study presents an exemplar that as a flexible and extensible tool GDPs can be used with different theories and models in the CCI field.\n",

Based on recent research investigating scalable behavioral health interventions and therapeutic best practices for Native American (NA) communities, we propose ARORA, a social and emotional learning intervention delivered over a networked mobile game that uses geosocial gaming mechanisms enhanced with augmented reality technology. Focusing on the Navajo community, we take a community-based participatory research approach to include NA psychologists, community health workers, and educators as co-designers of the intervention activities and gaming mechanisms.

Sonification and auditory graphs have been the primary methods of representing data through sound. However, the representation of mathematical elements of graphs is still unexplored. The experiments in this paper investigate optimal methods for representing mathematical elements of graphs with sound. The results indicate that the methods of design in this study are effective for describing mathematical elements of graphs, such as axes, quadrants and differentiability. These findings can help visually impaired learners to be more independent, and also facilitate further studies on assistive technology.\n",

      "Multi-touch gestures can be very difficult to program correctly because they require that developers build high-level abstractions from low-level touch events. In this paper, we introduce programming primitives that enable programmers to implement multi-touch gestures in a more understandable way by helping them build these abstractions. Our design of these primitives was guided by a formative study, in which we observed developers' natural implementations of custom gestures. Touch groups provide summaries of multiple fingers rather than requiring that programmers track them manually. Cross events allow programmers to summarize the movement of one or a group of fingers. We implemented these two primitives in two environments: a declarative programming system and in a standard imperative programming language. We found that these primitives are capable of defining nuanced multi-touch gestures, which we illustrate through a series of examples. Further, in two user evaluations of these programming primitives, we found that multi-touch behaviors implemented in these programming primitives are more understandable than those implemented with standard touch events.\n",

Strong of its form factor and affordance, the keycube offers advantages with regards to mobility, comfort, learnability, privacy and playfulness. Thus, the combination creates a novel text-entry interface convenient for many use cases across the whole reality-virtuality continuum.\n",

However, existing information channels for public policies deliver only few stakeholders' voices, thus failing to provide a diverse knowledge base for personal deliberation. This paper presents an initial design of PolicyScape, an online system that supports personal deliberation on public policies by helping citizens explore diverse stakeholders and their perspectives on the policy's effect. Building on literature on crowdsourced policymaking and policy stakeholders, we present several design choices for crowdsourcing stakeholder perspectives. We introduce perspective-taking as an approach for personal deliberation by helping users consider stakeholder perspectives on policy issues. Our initial results suggest that PolicyScape could collect diverse sets of perspectives from the stakeholders of public policies, and help participants discover unexpected viewpoints of various stakeholder groups.\n",

However, we could find no empirical evidence for this criticism. In this research, we collect monthly demographic data over a two-year period for a large online content publisher and generate fifteen personas each month following an identical algorithmic approach. We then compare the sets of personas month-over-month, year-over-year, and over the whole two-year period. Findings show that there is an average 18.7% change in personas monthly, a 23.3% change yearly, and a 47% change over the entire period. Findings support the critique that personas do change over time and also highlight that changes in the underlying data can occur within a relatively short period. The implication is that organizations using personas should employ ongoing data collection to detect possible persona changes.\n",
