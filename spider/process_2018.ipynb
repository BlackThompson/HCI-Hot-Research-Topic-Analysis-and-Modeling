      "Recently, voice-based intelligent agents (VIAs), such as Alexa, Siri, and Bixby, are becoming popular. One of the interaction challenges with VIAs is that it is difficult to deliver rich information, experience, and meaning via voice-only communication channels. We propose interactive thermal augmentation to address VIA's interaction challenges. We developed a prototype system and conducted a user study to investigate the effects of thermal interaction in a VIA interaction context. The preliminary study results revealed that: 1) the thermal interface helped the participants to understand the information better; 2) the integration of heat and sound sensation provided an immersive and engaging experience; 3) a thermal stimulus worked as an additional feedback channel that supplements the voice interface. We discuss potentials and considerations when adopting thermal interaction to enrich people's experiences with a VIA.\n",

      "Braille input enables fast nonvisual entry speeds on mobile touchscreen devices. Yet, the lack of tactile cues commonly results in typing errors, which are hard to correct. We propose Hybrid-Brailler, an input solution that combines physical and gestural interaction to provide fast and accurate Braille input. We use the back of the device for physical chorded input while freeing the touchscreen for gestural interaction. Gestures are used in editing operations, such as caret movement, text selection, and clipboard control, enhancing the overall text entry experience. We conducted two user studies to assess both input and editing performance. Results show that Hybrid-Brailler supports fast entry rates as its virtual counterpart, while significantly increasing input accuracy. Regarding editing performance, when compared with the mainstream technique, Hybrid-Brailler shows performance benefits of 21% in speed and increased editing accuracy. We finish with lessons learned for designing future nonvisual input and editing techniques.\n",

      "Rich metadata is becoming a key part of the broadcast production pipeline. This information can be used to deliver compelling new consumption experiences which are personalized, location-aware, interactive and multi-screen. However, media producers are struggling to generate the metadata required for such experiences, using inefficient post-production solutions which are limited in how much of the original context they can capture. In response, we present Media of Things (MoT), a tool for on-location media productions. MoT enables practical and flexible generation of sensor based point-of-capture metadata. We demonstrate how embedded ubiquitous sensing technologies such as the Internet of Things can be leveraged to produce context rich, time sequenced metadata in a production studio. We reflect on how this workflow can be integrated within the constraints of broadcast production and the possibilities that emerge from access to rich data at the beginning of the production lifecycle to produce well described media for reconfigurable consumption.\n",

      "The widespread use of text-based search in user interfaces has led designers in visualization to occasionally add search functionality to their creations. Yet it remains unclear how search may impact a person's behavior. Given the unstructured context of the web, users may not have explicit information-seeking goals and designers cannot make assumptions about user attention. To bridge this gap, we observed the impact of integrating search with five visualizations across 830 online participants. In an unguided task, we find that (1) the presence of text-based search influences people's information-seeking goals, (2) search can alter the data that people explore and how they engage with it, and (3) the effects of search are amplified in visualizations where people are familiar with the underlying dataset. These results suggest that text-search in web visualizations drives users towards more diverse information seeking goals, and may be valuable in a range of existing visualization designs.\n",

      "Video summaries are a popular way to share important events, but creating good summaries is hard. It requires expertise in both capturing and editing footage. While hiring a professional videographer is possible, this is too costly for most casual events. An alternative is to place 360 video cameras around an event space to capture footage passively and then extract regular field-of-view (RFOV) shots for the summary. This paper focuses on the problem of extracting such RFOV shots. Since we cannot actively control the cameras or the scene, it is hard to create \"ideal' shots that adhere strictly to traditional cinematography rules. To better understand the tradeoffs, we study human preferences for static and moving camera RFOV shots generated from 360 footage. From the findings, we derive design guidelines. As a secondary contribution, we use these guidelines to develop automatic algorithms that we demonstrate in a prototype user interface for extracting RFOV shots from 360 videos.\n",

      "The design, development and deployment of new technology is a form of intervention on the social, psychological and physical world. Whether explicitly intended or not, all digital technology is designed to support some vision of how work, leisure, education, healthcare, and so on, is organised in the future [11]. For example, most efforts to make commercial systems more usable, efficient and pleasurable, are ultimately about the vision of increased profits as part of a capitalist society. This workshop will bring together researchers, designers and practitioners to explore an alternative, post-capitalist, \"grand vision\" for HCI, asking what kind of futures the community sees itself as working towards.

Their shared principle is that while individual candidate results may likely be insufficient, they often complement each other so that they can be combined into something better than any of the individual results---the very spirit of collaborative working. For one, we extend a standard polygon-drawing interface to allow workers to annotate negative space, and combine the work of multiple workers instead of relying on a single best one as commonly done in crowdsourced image segmentation. For the other, we present a method to combine multiple automatic propagation algorithms with the help of the crowd. Such combination requires an understanding of where the algorithms fail, which we gather using a novel coarse scribble video annotation task. We evaluate our ensemble methods, discuss our design choices for them, and make our web-based crowdsourcing tools and results publicly available.\n",

We argue that more attention is needed for system sharing, especially because interfaces are known to influence coordination of shared use. In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of this relation. To do so, we design three interfaces for a shared lighting system that vary in the type of social information they allow people to share with others and in their overall interaction style. We systematically compare longitudinal and real-life use of the interfaces, evaluating (1) people's appraisal of three types of social information and (2) the influence of an interaction style on coordination of shared use. The results disclose relations between the interface and the amount of verbal communication, consideration, and accountability. With this work, we urge the need for interaction designers to consider shared use.\n",

      "Although a light becomes an important design element, there are little techniques available to explore shapes and light effects in early design stages. We present c.light, a design tool that consists of a set of modules and a mobile application for visualizing the light in a physical world. It allows designers to easily fabricate both tangible and intangible properties of a light without a technical barrier. We analyzed how c.light contributes to the ideation process of light design through a workshop. The results showed that c.light largely expands designers' capability to manipulate intangible properties of light and, by doing so, it facilitates collaborative and inverted ideation process in early design stages. It is expected that the results of this study could enhance our understanding of how designers manipulate light in a physical world in early design stages and could be a good stepping stone for future tool development.\n",

      "The mission of animators is to create nuanced, high-quality character motions. To achieve this, the careful editing of animation curves---curves that determine how a series of keyframed poses are interpolated over time---is an important task. Manual editing affords full and precise control, but requires tedious and nonintuitive trials and errors. Numerical optimization can automate such exploration; however, automatic solutions cannot always be perfect, and it is difficult for animators to control optimization owing to its black-box behavior. In this paper, we present a new framework called optimization-guided motion editing, which is aimed at maintaining a sense of full control while utilizing the power of optimization. We have designed interactions and developed a set of mathematical formulations to enable them. We discuss the framework's potential by demonstrating several usage scenarios with our proof-of-concept system, named OptiMo.\n",

      "Almost all research output includes tables, diagrams, photographs and even sketches, and papers within HCI typically take advantage of including these figures in their files. However the space given to non diagrammatical or tabular figures is often small, even in papers that primarily concern themselves with visual output. The reason for this might be the publishing models employed in most proceedings and journals: Despite moving to a digital format which is unhindered by page count or physical cost, there remains a somewhat arbitrary limitation on page count. Recent moves by ACM SIGCHI and others to remove references from the maximum page count suggest that there is movement on this, however images remain firmly within the limits of the text. We propose that images should be celebrated - not penalised - and call for not only the adoption of the Pictorials format in CHI, but for images to be removed from page counts in order to encourage greater transparency of process in HCI research.\n",

      "This paper presents Rolling-Menu, a technique for selecting toolbar items, based on the use of roll gestures with a multidimensional device, the Roly-Poly Mouse (RPM). Rolling-Menu reduces object-command transition, resulting in a better integration between command selection and direct manipulation of application objects. Selecting a toolbar item with Rolling-Menu requires rolling RPM in a predefined direction corresponding to the item. We propose a design space of Rolling-Menu that includes different roll mapping and validation modes. A first user's study, with a simple toolbar containing up to 14 items, establishes that the best version of Rolling-Menu takes, on average, up to 29% less time than the Mouse to select a toolbar item. Moreover accuracy of the selection with Rolling-Menu is above 90%. Both the validation mode and the mapping between roll direction and toolbar items influence the performance of Rolling-Menus. A second study compares the three best versions of Rolling-Menu with the Mouse to select an item in two types of multidimensional toolbars: a toolbar containing dropdown lists, and a grid toolbar. Results confirm the advantage of Rolling-Menu over a Mouse.\n",

There are several promising models for stroking motions, such as crossing tasks, which require endpoint accuracy of a stroke, or steering tasks, which require continuous accuracy throughout the trajectory. However, a task requiring users to repeatedly steer through constrained path segments has never been studied, although such operations are needed in GUIs, e.g., for selecting icons or objects on illustration software through lassoing. We empirically confirmed that the interval, trajectory width, and obstacle size significantly affect the movement speed. Existing models can not accurately predict user performance in such tasks. We found several unexpected results such as that steering through denser objects sometimes required less times than expected. Speed profile analysis showed the reasons behind such behaviors, such as participants' anticipation strategies. We also discuss the applicability of exiting performance models and revisions.\n",

      "A major goal of collaborative ideation is improving the creativity of the ideas generated. Recent approaches enhance creativity by showing users similar ideas during productive ideation and diverse ideas when they reach an impasse. However, related work either demands a higher mental effort from users to assess similarity or yields only a limited number of similarity values. Furthermore, idea relationship is only considered in one dimension (similarity). In our research in progress, we introduce a new approach called concept validation. It enables us to (1) capture the conceptualization of users' ideas and (2) assess multi-dimensional relationships between all ideas in near real-time. We conducted a study with 90 participants to validate the suitability of our approach. The results indicate that adding the extraction of semantic concepts to the ideation process has no negative impact on number and creativity of ideas generated. This signifies an important step towards our vision of an idea-based knowledge graph used by an interactive system to improve computer-supported human creativity.\n",

So far, auditory ASEs using beep sounds, visual ASEs using LEDs, and motion ASEs using robot movements have been implemented and shown to be effective. In this paper, we propose a novel type of ASE that uses vibration (vibrational ASEs). We implemented the vibrational ASEs on a smartphone and conducted experiments to confirm whether they can convey a system's confidence level to users in the same way as the other types of ASEs. The results clearly showed that vibrational ASEs were able to accurately and intuitively convey the designed confidence level to participants, demonstrating that ASEs can be applied in a variety of applications in real environments.\n",

They are regularly used by both professional musicians as well as novices with very little experience in audio editing and music composition. The process of creating music loops can be challenging and tedious, particularly for novices. We present LoopMaker, an interactive system that assists users in creating and exploring music loops from pre-recorded music. Our system can be used in a semi-automatic mode in which it refines a user's rough selection of a loop. It can also be used in a fully automatic mode in which it creates a number of loops from a given piece of music and interactively allows the user to explore these loops. Our user study suggests that our system makes the loop creation process significantly faster, easier, and more enjoyable than manual creation for both novices and experts. It also suggests that the quality of these loops are comparable to manually created loops by experts.\n",

      "PolarTrack is a novel camera-based approach to detecting and tracking mobile devices inside the capture volume. In PolarTrack, a polarization filter continuously rotates in front of an off-the-shelf color camera, which causes the displays of observed devices to periodically blink in the camera feed. The periodic blinking results from the physical characteristics of current displays, which shine polarized light either through an LC overlay to produce images or through a polarizer to reduce light reflections on OLED displays. PolarTrack runs a simple detection algorithm on the camera feed to segment displays and track their locations and orientations, which makes PolarTrack particularly suitable as a tracking system for cross-device interaction with mobile devices. Our evaluation of PolarTrack's tracking quality and comparison with state-of-the-art camera-based multi-device tracking showed a better tracking accuracy and precision with similar tracking reliability. PolarTrack works as standalone multi-device tracking but is also compatible with existing camera-based tracking systems and can complement them to compensate for their limitations.\n",

      "Biologists often perform experiments whose results generate large quantities of data, such as interactions between molecules in a cell, that are best represented as networks (graphs). To visualize these networks and communicate them in publications, biologists must manually position the nodes and edges of each network to reflect their real-world physical structure. This process does not scale well, and graph layout algorithms lack the biological underpinnings to offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we present CrowdLayout, a crowdsourcing system that leverages human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. CrowdLayout provides design guidelines, abstractions, and editing tools to help novice workers perform like experts. We evaluated CrowdLayout in two experiments with paid crowd workers and real biological network data, finding that crowds could both create and evaluate meaningful, high-quality layouts. We also discuss implications for crowdsourced design and network visualizations in other domains.\n",

We conducted a diary study with nine households to investigate this, and present the preliminary results in this paper. Participants took advantage of the freedom and choice these services provided, watching on different devices, in different locations, and for extended periods of time. However, the majority of viewing conformed to traditional patterns, occurring in the evening on large screens, though viewing on a laptop was slightly more popular than the television. We found that usage of on-demand services was influenced by situational factors such as location and the devices that are available.\n",

By triangulating in-game data with Twitter activity we explore how tweets can provide contextual information for understanding fluctuations in in-game activity. To facilitate analysis of the data we introduce a visual data exploration tool and use it to analyze tweets related to the game Destiny.

      "Here we present a social wearables prototype, i.e. a wearable that augments collocated social interaction: the Lågom. This design is meant to support people to be aware of and better regulate their verbal participation in group discussions. Lågom takes the shape of a colorful, bulky and funny looking flower that senses the wearer's speaking and responds with haptic and visual feedback. We ran a pilot study with nine people participating in a class discussion. Preliminary results show potential of the haptic feedback to increase self awareness of participation, and to help people better regulate their participation in group discussions.\n",

      "Stammering is a speech disorder affecting approximately 1% of the worldwide population. It can have associated impacts on daily life, such as loss of confidence in social situations and increased anxiety levels (particularly when speaking to strangers). Work exploring the development of digital tools to support people who stammer (PwS) is emerging. However, there is a paucity of research engaging PwS in the design process, with participation being facilitated mainly in testing phases. In this paper, we describe the user-centered design, development and evaluation of StammerApp, a mobile application to support PwS. We contribute insights into the challenges and barriers that PwS experience day-to-day and reflect on the complexities of designing with this diverse group. Finally, we present a set of design recommendations for the development of tools to support PwS in their everyday interactions, and provide an example of how these might be envisioned through the StammerApp prototype.\n",

      "Sequence recommender systems assist people in making decisions, such as which product to purchase and what places to visit on vacation. Despite their ubiquity, most sequence recommender systems are black boxes and do not offer justifications for their recommendations or provide user controls for steering the algorithm. In this paper, we design and develop an interactive sequence recommender system (SeRIES) prototype that uses visualizations to explain and justify the recommendations and provides controls so that users may personalize the recommendations. We conducted a user study comparing SeRIES to a black-box system with 12 participants using real visitor trajectory data in Melbourne and show that SeRIES users are more informed about how the recommendations are generated, more confident in following the recommendations, and more engaged in the decision process.\n",

      "India is home to the largest under-25 demographic profile in the world, but lacks a job-ready educational system. It requires a wide-spread, skill-oriented educational model, equipping youth to thrive in highly dynamic job markets. As a response to the huge demand for technical education, a large private skill-tutoring ecosystem has sprung up in In-dia but remains geographically limited. This paper, drawn from a three-month ethnographic research conducted in Ameerpet (arguably India's largest IT skilling hub), probes the pedagogic style and characteristics of tutoring, and of-fers reasons why learners prefer to enroll into a physical model of classroom teaching over online courses. We make design suggestions for online learning platforms to attract students who are marginalized in the more formal and com-petitive education system, and opt for Ameerpet-like skill-hubs. Our primary offering is to suggest a shift in perspec-tive of online education platforms to include job readiness and accompanying changes in course content and delivery.\n",

      "Beyond current dyadic chatbots and voice-based personal assistants, this demo showcases a novel experience where users interact with multiple, text-based conversational systems as if seating around a table with them. Two key technologies allow the seamless interaction between users and chatbots: (1) A state-of-art artificial conversational governance system which allows a natural flow of conversation without the use of vocatives to trigger the chatbot responses; (2) a conversation visualization mechanism where the utterances from participants are aesthetically projected on a tabletop. Those technologies were developed originally for \"Café com os Santiagos\" an artwork where visitors conversed with three chatbots portraying characters from a book in a scenographic space recreating a 19th-century coffee table. The demo allows users to seat to actually have coffee and chat with multi-chatbots characters.\n",

      "We propose an interaction restraint that aims to degrade interactivity of a device, for example, by asking users to perform a mandatory cognitive task whenever they start an interaction. This mechanism is designed to help users to self-reflect upon their interaction intent with the devices, and thus they can break the habit of unconscious frequent access to their smartphones. We perform a preliminary study to understand the design requirements of the cognitive tasks and develop a high-fidelity prototype. Our field trial clearly documents that a positive influence of interaction restraints on deterring habitual frequent use of smartphones.\n",

      "The Internet plays an important role in the formation of political opinions by supporting citizens in discovering diverse political information and opinions. However, the echo chamber effect has become of increasing concern, referring to the tendency for people to encounter opinions and information similar to their own online. It remains poorly understood how ordinary citizens use the Internet in the formation of political opinions. To answer this question, we conducted an interview study with 32 Chinese citizens. We found that participants used complex strategies to coordinate personal networks and technologies in specific ways to better understand political events. To analyze this phenomenon, we draw on Bødker and Andersen's model of complex mediation which describes how multiple mediators including people and artifacts work together to mediate an activity. We discuss how complex mediation supported participants in informing their political opinions. We derive design implications for supporting people to form political opinions.\n",

Our experience-centered, research-through-design study engaged eight participants across five UK homes, in a month-long deployment of a prototype technology -- a design research artifact, Admixed Portrait, that served to prompt participant reflection on first-time parenthood. In addition to pre- and post-deployment interviews, participants kept diaries capturing personal reflections during the deployment, on daily social media use and interactions with Admixed. Our qualitative insights on social media representations of transitional experience and identity for new parents, reveal how their online 'photowork' related to self-expression and social functioning. We contribute design considerations for developing tools to support photographic expression in social media use, and methodological insights about design-led inquiry for understanding transitional experiences.\n",

      "There has been a growing concern over the huge increase in use of smart media by young children. This study explores the possibility of using augmented-reality(AR) for regulat-ing preschoolers' media usage behavior. With MABLE (mobile application for behavioral learning and education), parents can provide AR-assisted feedback by changing facial expressions and sound effects. When overlaying a smart media, which has MABLE running, in front of a QR marker on a puppet, a facial expression is displayed on top of the puppet's face. A two-week long experiment with 36 parent-child pairs showed that compared to using just the puppet, using MABLE showed higher amount of engage-ment among preschoolers. For the effectiveness of parental mediation in terms of self-control, our data showed mixed results. MABLE had positive effects in that the amount of rule-compliance increased and problematic behaviors de-creased, whereas the level of behavioral dependency on smart media was not influenced.\n",

      "Interpersonal distance behaviors can vary significantly across countries and impact human social interaction. Do these cross-cultural differences play out when one of the interaction partners participates through a teleoperated robot? Emerging research shows that when being approached by a robot, people tend to hold similar cultural preferences as they would for an approaching human. However, no work yet has investigated this question from a robot teleoperator's perspective. Toward answering this, we conducted an online study (N = 774) using a novel simulation paradigm across two countries (U.S. and India). Results show that in the role of a telepresence robot operator, participants exhibited cross-cultural differences in interpersonal distance behavior in line with human-human proxemic research, indicating that culture-specific distance behavior can manifest in the way a robot operator controls a robot. We discuss implications for designers who seek to automate path planning and navigation for teleoperated robots.\n",

      "Families preserve memories of their special and everyday experiences, though it can be hard to capture all these moments in everyday life. We explore the concept of automated forms of capturing family life and presenting them through situated, tangible everyday artifacts in the home. We designed Time-Turner, an always-on video recording system along with a set of three drink coasters that allow family members to easily search, filter and replay videos to connect to their past. We engaged households in speculative enactments and interviews to explore the design space. Our findings point to the value of witnessing real rather than staged moments and the ways in which the affordances of everyday artifacts can allow media to be 'lived with' as a part of everyday life. Yet our design also revealed tensions around sharing and changing perceptions across time and generations. This points to design challenges around safeguarding this media and capturing 'reality' as opposed to curated content.\n",

      "Conventionally, keys on a physical keyboard have only two states: \"released'' and \"pressed''. As such, various techniques, such as hotkeys, are designed to enhance the keyboard expressiveness. Realizing that user inevitably perform touch actions during keystrokes, we propose GestAKey, leveraging location and motion of the touch on individual keycaps to augment the functionalities of existing keystrokes. With a log study, we collected touch data for both normal usage (typing and hotkeys) and while performing touch gestures (location and motion), which are analyzed to assess the viability of augmenting keystrokes with simultaneous gestures. A controlled experiment was conducted to compare GestAKey with existing keyboard interaction techniques, in terms of efficiency and learnability. The results show that GestAKey has comparable performance with hotkey. We further discuss the insights of integrating such touch modality into existing keyboard interaction, and demonstrate several usage scenarios.\n",

      "This paper investigates the effect of vibro-kinetic (VK) technology on psychophysiological states of users in a virtual reality context. Specifically, we investigate whether a VK seat, i.e., a seat using movement and vibration synchronized with a given media, induces psychophysiological states aligned with an optimal immersive virtual reality (VR) experience. We test our hypotheses with subjects in a seated position while experiencing a passive vehicular movement with a VR headset. Using a between-subject experiment, 45 participants were randomly assigned to a VK or a non-VK condition. Users' psychophysiological states were measured using electrodermal activity, heart rate, and user perceptions. We find evidence that VK significantly enhances the physiological activation of the user throughout the experience. Also, we find that VK seems to create a psychological state that requires less conscious autoregulation, which could suggest that users experience less cybersickness in this condition.\n",

      "Graphical displays are a typical means for conveying awareness information in groupware systems to help users track joint activities, but are not ideal when vision is constrained. Understanding how people maintain awareness through non-visual means is crucial for designing effective alternatives for supporting awareness in such situations. We present a lab study simulating an extreme scenario where 32 pairs of participants use an audio-only tool to edit shared audio menus. Our aim is to characterise collaboration in this audio-only space in order to identify whether and how, by itself, audio can mediate collaboration. Our findings show that the means for audio delivery and choice of working styles in this space influence types and patterns of awareness information exchange. We thus highlight the need to accommodate different working styles when designing audio support for awareness, and extend previous research by identifying types of awareness information to convey in response to group work dynamics.\n",

      "Touch interactions are now ubiquitous, but few tools are available to help designers quickly prototype touch interfaces and predict their performance. For rapid prototyping, most applications only support visual design. For predictive modelling, tools such as CogTool generate performance predictions but do not represent touch actions natively and do not allow exploration of different usage contexts. To combine the benefits of rapid visual design tools with underlying predictive models, we developed the Storyboard Empirical Modelling tool (StEM) for exploring and predicting user performance with touch interfaces. StEM provides performance models for mainstream touch actions, based on a large corpus of realistic data. We evaluated StEM in an experiment and compared its predictions to empirical times for several scenarios. The study showed that our predictions are accurate (within 7% of empirical values on average), and that StEM correctly predicted differences between alternative designs. Our tool provides new capabilities for exploring and predicting touch performance, even in the early stages of design.\n",

      "The concept of power pose originates from a Psychology study from 2010 which suggested that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. Follow-up experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead to more dishonest behaviors. While multiple replication attempts of the 2010 study failed, the follow-up experiments on incidental postures have so far not been replicated. As UI design in HCI can incidentally lead to expansive body postures, we attempted two conceptual replications: we first asked 44 participants to tap areas on a wall-sized display and measured their self-reported sense of power; we then asked 80 participants to play a game on a large touch-screen and measured risk-taking. Based on Bayesian analyses we find that incidental power poses had little to no effect on our measures but could cause physical discomfort. We conclude by discussing our findings in the context of theory-driven research in HCI.\n",

      "In this late breaking work, we present preliminary results from a portion of an auto-ethnography in which an HCI scholar drove for both Uber and Lyft over the course of 4 months, recording his thoughts about the driving experience as well as his experiences with-and emails from-both platforms. The first phase of results we present here are based on several text analyses of the collected emails, as well as a preliminary examination of field notes in relation to these emails. We found that while Uber and Lyft participate in the gig economy in almost identical ways, the difference in tone apparent through each platform's messaging could lead to conflicting experiences for drivers. We identify implications for the potential future analyses of our autoethnographic data in relation to this psycholinguistic analysis.\n",

      "Because appearance-constrained robots lack expressiveness, human users often find it hard to understand their behavior and intentions. To address this, expressive lights are considered to be an effective means for such robots to communicate with people. However, existing studies mainly focus on specific tasks or goals, leaving the knowledge of how expressive lights affect people's perception still unknown. In this pilot study, we investigate such a question by using a Roomba robot. We designed two light expressions, namely, green and low-intensity (GL) and red and high-intensity (RH). We used open-ended questions to evaluate people's perception and interpretation of the robot, which showed different light expressions as a way to communicate. Our findings reveal that simple light expressions can allow people to construct rich and complex interpretations of a robot's behavior, and such interpretations are heavily biased by the design of expressive lights.\n",

      "TopoText is a context-preserving technique for visualizing text data for multi-scale spatial aggregates to gain insight into spatial phenomena. Conventional exploration requires users to navigate across multiple scales but only presents the information related to the current scale. This limitation potentially adds more steps of interaction and cognitive overload to the users. TopoText renders multi-scale aggregates into a single visual display combining novel text-based encoding and layout methods that draw labels along the boundary or filled within the aggregates. The text itself not only summarizes the semantics at each individual scale, but also indicates the spatial coverage of the aggregates and their underlying hierarchical relationships. We validate TopoText with both a user study as well as several application examples.\n",

      "We introduce the concept of Veritaps: a communication layer to help users identify truths and lies in mobile input. Existing lie detection research typically uses features not suitable for the breadth of mobile interaction. We explore the feasibility of detecting lies across all mobile touch interaction using sensor data from commodity smartphones. We report on three studies in which we collect discrete, truth-labelled mobile input using swipes and taps. The studies demonstrate the potential of using mobile interaction as a truth estimator by employing features such as touch pressure and the inter-tap details of number entry, for example. In our final study, we report an F1-score of .98 for classifying truths and .57 for lies. Finally we sketch three potential future scenarios of using lie detection in mobile applications; as a security measure during online log-in, a trust layer during online sale negotiations, and a tool for exploring self-deception.\n",

      "This research explores patient education in pediatric hematology and oncology clinics. Based on interviews, observations, and a review of existing patient materials, we argue that education in clinic waiting rooms is in need of reform. We applied design principles from research in science museums along with tangible interaction techniques to create the Sickle Cell Station, an interactive learning experience about sickle cell disease. To evaluate the effectiveness of this design we observed approximately 580 participants in a pediatric hematology clinic waiting area in four different design conditions. These observations included detailed video analysis of 81 patients and their parents to understand their interaction and learning with the Sickle Cell Station. Our results show an engaging learning experience with relevant conversation, inquiry, and collaboration. We describe how patient engagement varied in the four design conditions and conclude with implications for new designs in the area of Active Waiting Education (AWE).\n",

We en-countered many challenges from thinking with, designing for, and interfacing through taste, including: - how can and should we grapple with contamination?, and - how might lickable interfaces influence more-than-humans?

      "Central venous catheterization is a relatively common bedside medical procedure that involves the placement of a catheter into a patient»s internal jugular vein in order to administer medication or fluids. To learn this technique, medical students traditionally practice on training mannequins under the guidance of a clinical instructor. The objective of this project was to co-develop a standardized augmented reality solution for teaching medical students this procedure, which would enable them to practice independently and at their own pace. Following an iterative design and prototyping process, we compiled a comprehensive set of usability heuristics specific to augmented reality healthcare applications, used to identify unique usability issues associated with augmented reality software. This approach offers a better strategy to improve the usability of augmented reality system and increases the potential to standardize and render medical education more accessible. The benefits of applying augmented reality to simulated medical education come with heavy consequences in the event of poor learning outcomes. The usability of these systems is paramount to ensure the development of clinical competence is facilitated and not hindered.\n",

However, the performance of LfD is highly sensitive to the quality of demonstrations which in turn depends on the user-interface. In this paper, we propose the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to develop an intuitive interface that enables users to provide good demonstrations. We apply this approach to the task of training a visual attention system which is a crucial component for tasks such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction. We show that interaction time of few minutes is sufficient to train a deep neural network to successfully learn attention strategies.\n",

      "Videogames are complex stimuli, and selecting games that consistently induce a desired player experience (PX) in an experimental setting can be challenging. The number of relatively high-quality games being released each year continues to increase, which makes deriving a shortlist of plausible candidate games from this pool increasingly problematic. Despite this, guidance for structuring and reporting on the game selection process remains limited. This paper therefore proposes two approaches to game selection: the first leverages online videogame databases and existing PX research, and is structured with respect to widely-applicable videogame metadata. The second process applies established game design theory to serve researchers when insufficient connections between desired PX outcomes and recognisable game elements exist. Both methods are accompanied by example reports of their application. The present work aims to assist experimental researchers in selecting videogames likely to meet their needs, while encouraging more rigorous standards of reporting in the field.\n",

In the case of cooperative driver-vehicle interaction, new interfaces have to be developed, for instance to approve maneuvers. We implemented two different interaction techniques (clicking and holding down a button) to approve an overtaking maneuver on rural roads. We conducted a driving simulator study to investigate the effects of the interaction techniques on a touchscreen regarding usability. Our results suggest that a simple click provides better usability. Finally, we highlight future research directions that should be considered for the design of such interfaces for cooperative driver-vehicle interaction.\n",

      "Water is an essential nutrient for human health. However, individuals may ignore drinking enough water due to the rush of everyday life. We present Grow, a conceptual smart bottle prototype designed to encourage users to drink water regularly. Our concept utilizes bottle surface as an ambient display instead of a traditional screen-based display to give feedback. Grow tracks daily water intake through an embedded liquid level sensor. It gives positive, abstract, non-intrusive and aesthetic feedback through heating up different parts of a thermo-chromic print on its surface (a tree image). We also present the results of a user study exploring 10 prospective users' reactions to Grow as well as their expectations of smart water bottles in general.\n",

      "With HCI, researchers conduct studies in interdisciplinary projects involving massive volume of data, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Awareness of the responsibility is emerging as a key concern for the HCI community. This Community will be impacted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [5], that will enter into force on the 25th of May 2018. From that date, each data controller and data processor will face an increase of its legal obligations (in particular its accountability) under certain conditions. The GDPR encourages the adoption of Soft Law mechanisms, approved by the national competent authority on data protection, to demonstrate the compliance to the Regulation. Approved Guidelines, Codes of Conducts, Labeling, Marks and Seals dedicated to data protection, as well as certification mechanisms are some of the options proposed by the GDPR. There may be discrepancies between the realities of HCI fieldwork and the formal process of obtaining Soft Law approval by Competent Authorities dedicated to data protection. Given these issues, it is important for researchers to reflect on legal and ethical encounters in HCI research as a community. This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share experiences about Soft Law they have put in place to increase Trust, Transparency and Accountability among the shareholders. These discussions will be used to develop a white paper of practical Soft Law mechanisms (certification, labeling, marks, seals...) emerging in HCI research with the aim to demonstrate that the GDPR may be an opportunity for the HCI community.\n",

      "A majority of users of smartphones and laptops report that they struggle with effective self-control over their device use. In response, HCI research - as well as a rapidly growing commercial market for 'anti-distraction tools' - has begun to develop apps, browser plugins, and other tools that help users understand and regulate their use. The extensive literature on the mechanics of self-regulation from cognitive neuroscience and behavioural economics might help guide this work. However, so far the emerging HCI work has drawn on a very limited subset of self-regulatory models, in particular Social-Cognitive Theory. Here, we draw together main insights from a broader spectrum of basic research on the mechanics of self-regulation in a simple framework. We use the generated model to analyse interventions in a sample of 112 existing anti-distraction tools, and hope it may contribute a useful alternative view of the design space for UI features that support self-regulation.\n",

In this work, we present the physical arrangement of the control room workplaces and describe work routines with a focus on the interaction with visually displayed content. While staff members stated that they would prefer to use even more display space, we identified critical challenges for input on LHRDs and designing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for LHRDs.\n",

      "Basic numerical competencies developed in kindergarten form the foundations of math achievement. This indicates the importance of early interventions in the case of numerical difficulties. Building on research on math manipulatives and tangible interfaces, we developed a training of basic numerical competencies using an interactive tabletop in combination with physical LEGO-like blocks. In an experiment, we evaluated the effectiveness of the training on children's learning of the partner number concept, basic numerical competencies and number line estimation, compared to a content-wise similar training with physical manipulatives and a human tutor. We observed significant increases in children's understanding of the partner number concept and basic numerical competencies in both training conditions, but no differential training effects. As children can play on the interactive surface with reasonable autonomy, it seems to provide a low threshold possibility to enrich kindergarten education on numerical concepts.\n",

Here we present a description of the navigation experience of older pedestrians either with a visual (augmented reality glasses) or an auditory (bone conduction headset) wearable device providing guidance messages adapted to age-related declines. The study, with 18 participants, analyses the navigation performance and users' experience using explicitation interviews. We highlight that sharing attention, trusting the system temporality and experiencing the discretion of the device are the main concerns for older people, impacting the quality of their user experience.

      "In recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as Unity and Unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3D user interfaces. In these systems, UI components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. In some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. When components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. Moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular UIs cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. To address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, Mercury, to facilitate communication among components. We provide an overview of Mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in Unity, and present example systems built using Mercury to explain its advantages.\n",

      "Donation-based crowdfunding platforms have an increasing number of campaigns on socially stigmatized topics. These platforms' widespread online reachability and the large flow of monetary donations have the potential to shape individuals' opinions by influencing their perceptions. However, little research has been done to investigate whether these campaigns impact individuals' opinions and how. We conducted an experiment to explore how an attitude-inconsistent campaign on fairness and equality for LGBTIQ people influenced participants' opinion on this topic. Although all the participants changed their perceived opinions after reading the support for the campaigns, participants opposing equality were less inclined to change their attitude than participants supporting equality. To examine this difference further, we conducted another experiment where participants were exposed to both attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent campaigns with varying levels of social support. Participants opposing equality showed less sensitivity to the level of social support, and wanted to donate significantly more money to anti-equality campaigns compared to those who supported equality. Results demonstrate the complex role of crowdfunding campaigns in shaping individuals' opinions on stigmatized topics.\n",

      "REVIVE explores the affordances of live interaction between the artificial musical agent MASOM, human electronic musicians, and visual generation agents. The Musical Agent based on Self-Organizing Maps (MASOM) has memorized sound objects and learned how to temporally structure them by listening to large corpora of human-made music. MASOM is then able to improvise live interacting with the other (human) performers by imitating the style of what it reminds it of. For each musician, a corresponding visual agent puts its sound and musical decision into images thus allowing the audience to see who does what. This reveals the musical gestures that are so often lost in electronic music performance. For CHI, MASOM plays with two live performers for a 20 minute audiovisual REVIVE experience.\n",

      "Developing interactive systems often involves a large set of callback functions for handling user interaction, which makes it challenging to manage UI behaviors, create descriptive documentation, and track code revisions. We developed Doppio, a tool that automatically tracks and visualizes UI flows and their changes based on source code. For each input event listener of a widget, e.g., onClick of an Android View class, Doppio captures and associates its UI output from a program execution with its code snippet from the codebase. It automatically generates a screenflow diagram organized by the callback methods and interaction flow, where developers can review the code and UI revisions interactively. Doppio, as an IDE plugin, is seamlessly integrated into a common development workflow. Our studies show that our tool is able to generate quality visual documentation and helped participants understand unfamiliar source code and track changes.\n",

      "This workshop aims to generate an interdisciplinary research agenda for digital touch communication that effectively integrates technological progress with robust investigations of the social nature and significance of digital touch. State-of-the-art touch-based technologies have the potential to supplement, extend or reconfigure how people communicate through reshaping existing touch practices and generating new capacities. Their possible impact on interpersonal intimacy, wellbeing, cultural norms, ways of knowing and power relations is far-reaching and under-researched. Few emerging devices and applications are embedded into everyday touch practices, limiting empirical exploration of the implications of digital touch technologies in everyday communication. There is, thus, a real need for methodological innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration to critically examine digital touch communication across social contexts and technological domains, to better understand the social consequences of how touch is digitally remediated. This agenda-setting workshop will bring together HCI researchers and designers with colleagues from sociology, media & communications, arts & design to address key research challenges and build the foundations for future collaborations.\n",

In order to enhance the work process' interface, users are outfitted with a head-mounted display (HMD), so they can both actively access process relevant machine data and passively receive system notifications in a heads-up display (HUD), instead of having to manually query the terminal of the machine of interest at its very location. This approach was implemented and tested in a field study with one of the assembly lines of an electronics manufacturing services (EMS)-company. 30 staff members were recruited as test subjects and 90% of them appreciated the system deployment, due to its noticeable additional benefits compared to the status quo.\n",

Following previous structured social technological interventions which have proved useful in increasing social skills of children with Autism, this research outlines the methodologies followed to develop a virtual environment system which may rapidly transform a standard classroom into an interactive play space. Research methods included field studies, stakeholder interviews, requirements gathering, prototype construction and feedback, and usability testing. This research in developing classroom technologies stands to pose significant benefits to this group of individuals at risk of social exclusion due to cognitive or learning conditions.\n",

      "Mobility impairments can prevent older adults from performing their daily activities which highly impacts a person's quality of life. Exoskeleton technology can assist older adults by providing additional support to compensate for age-related decline in muscle strength. To date little is known about the opinions and needs of older adults regarding exoskeletons as current research primarily focuses on the technical development of exoskeleton devices. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to inform the design of exoskeletons from a human-centered perspective. Interviews were conducted with seven older adults and six healthcare professionals. Results indicated that exoskeletons can be a valuable addition to existing mobility devices. Accepting the need for mobility aids was found to be challenging due to associated stigmas. Therefore, an exoskeleton with a discreet appearance was preferred. Ultimately, the willingness to use exoskeleton technology will depend on personal needs and preferences.\n",

The design of the AR system was based on and extends our prior tangible reading system called PhonoBlocks. In this paper, we discuss why and how we extend the work from PhonoBlocks to an AR system design. The goal of our system is to teach children explicit letter-sound correspondences. Two key design features of our system, which are different from other systems, are the use of augmented dynamic colour cues and 3D physical lowercase letters that help to draw children's attention to how letters' positions in words change letter sounds. Unlike our previous system, our AR system uses off-the-shelf technology so it can be easily scaled and distributed. We discuss the advantages and opportunities for our AR solution, and outline our future plans for evaluating this system.\n",

A challenge when designing for such interactions using technology like social robots, virtual agents, and tablets is understanding the social-emotional behaviors pertinent to storytelling-especially when emulating a natural peer-to-peer relation between the child and the technology. We present P2PSTORY, a dataset of young children (5-6 years old) engaging in natural peer-to-peer storytelling interactions with fellow classmates. The dataset consists of rich social behaviors of children without adult supervision, with each participant demonstrating being a storyteller and a listener. The dataset contains 58 video recorded sessions along with a diverse set of behavioral annotations as well as developmental and demographic profiles of each child participant. We describe the main characteristics of the dataset in addition to findings that reveal perceptual differences between adults and children when evaluating the attentiveness of listeners.\n",

In this late-breaking work, we propose a novel way for creating dynamic 2.5D skin textures, called SKIN+, a soft fluidic mini-scale user interface by introducing fluidic actuation. We have created four swatches with different pre-defined textures, topologies and structures to explore how this fluidic actuation system can benefit on-skin experiences and interactions. Our work details the intriguing experiences and interactions and future applications of on-skin wearables.

Digital previs can involve complex technical tasks, e.g. 3D scene creation, animation, and camera work, which require trained skills that are not available to all personnel involved in creative decisions for the production. Interaction techniques such as virtual reality (VR) enable users to interact with 3D content in a natural way compared to classical 2D interfaces. As a first step, we developed VR based prototypes and performed an exploratory user study to evaluate how non-technical professionals from the film, animation, and theater domain assess the use of VR for previs. Our results show that users were able to interact with complex 3D scenes after a short phase of familiarization and rated VR for previs as useful for their professional work.\n",

      "We consider the challenge of motivating and coordinating large numbers of people to contribute to solving local, communal problems through their existing routines. In order to design such \"on-the-go crowdsourcing\" systems, there is a need for mechanisms that can effectively coordinate contributions to address problem solving needs in the physical world while leveraging people's existing mobility with minimal disruption. We thus introduce Hit-or-Wait, a general decision-theoretic mechanism that intelligently controls decisions over when to notify a person of a task, in ways that reason both about system needs across tasks and about a helper's changing patterns of mobility. Through simulations and a field study in the context of community-based lost-and-found, we demonstrate that using Hit-or-Wait enables a system to make efficient use of people's contributions with minimal disruptions to their routines without the need for explicit coordination. Interviews with field study participants further suggest that highlighting an individual's contribution to the global goal may help people value their contributions more.\n",

NYAM empowers youth to use their intrinsic motivations to create artwork that unpacks the deeply layered ways in which violence affects living in Chicago uniquely for each of them. Guided by the composite framework of Transformative Activist Stance (TAS) and a social justice orientation to interaction design, NYAM placed these artworks on billboards in public spaces and enabled them with GPS and Augmented Reality technologies to create unexpected experiences that encouraged participation in gun violence prevention.

      "Distributed systems are very complex and in case of errors hard to debug. The high number of messages with non deterministic delivery timings, as well as message losses, data corruption and node crashes cannot be efficiently analyzed with traditional GUI tools. We propose to use immersive technologies in a multi-display environment to tackle these shortcomings. Our DebugAR approach shows a representation of the current systems state, message provenance, and the lifetime of participating nodes and offers layouting techniques. By providing a screen that shows a traditional text-log, we bridge the gap to conventional tools. Additionally, we propose an interactive 3D visualization of the message flow, combining an interactive tabletop with augmented reality using a head-mounted display. We are confident that our proposed solution can not only be used to analyze distributed system, but also for other time-dependent networks.\n",

      "In this paper, we propose to use facial electrical stimulation to control maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the upper limbs. The method is based on a body mechanism in which the contraction of the masseter muscles enhances MVC of the limb muscles. Facial electrical stimulation is applied to the masseter muscles and the lips. The former is to enhance the MVC by causing involuntary contraction of the masseter muscles, and the latter is to suppress the MVC by interfering with voluntary contraction of the masseter muscles. In a user study, we used electromyography sensors on the upper limbs to evaluate the effects of the facial electrical stimulation on the MVC of the upper limbs. The experimental results show that the MVC was controlled by the facial electrical stimulation. We assume that the proposed method is useful for sports athletes because the MVC is linked to sports performance.\n",

      "The Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI) is a phenomenon whereby cities tend to be hotter than suburbs. We frame the UHI as a \"wicked problem\" that poses a range of economic, healthcare, and social challenges. Our paper examines how different stakeholders negotiate complex value systems, collect data, and rely on collaborative platforms to address the problem of urban heat. Using documentary filmmaking as a research method, we conducted ethnographically-oriented interviews with participants including vulnerable communities, urban architects, microclimate researchers, and grassroots activists. Our findings reveal that unlike problems that can be solved using traditional HCI paradigms of distributed work, the UHI presents an entanglement of challenges that do not necessarily converge on a single solution. We conclude by discussing two opportunities for addressing wicked problems through social computing: knowledge systems for sharing hybrid data across domains and interactive forums for discourse among diverse actors.\n",

In a study of a sample of 30,000 new editors belonging to 1,054 English WikiProjects, we empirically examine the effects of generalized prior work-productivity experience (measured by overall prior article edits), prior leadership experience (measured by overall prior project edits), and localized prior work-productivity experience (measured by pre-joining article edits on a project) on early retention and productivity. We find that (1)generalized prior work-productivity experience is positively associated with retention, but negatively associated with productivity (2) prior leadership experience is negatively associated with both retention and productivity, and (3) localized prior work-productivity experience is positively associated with both retention and productivity within that focal project. We then discuss implications to inform the designs of early interventions aimed at group success.\n",

      "All too often, research partnerships are project-driven and short-lived. Multi-lifespan design and other longer-term approaches offer alternative models. In this paper, we contribute one alternative model for cross-boundary research partnerships spanning longer timeframes and offer one best practice: collaborative reflection. Specifically, we provide an in-depth case study of a multi-lifespan design partnership (over nine years and ongoing) between a Rwandan NGO focused on peacebuilding and a US university research group focused on information design theory and method. First, we document our process for conducting a collaborative reflection that seeks balance among the contributors while navigating differences in culture, discipline, experience, and skills. Next, we reflect on five themes: (1) common ground: sensibilities and commitments; (2) trust; (3) research landscape: crossing nations and institutions; (4) research as a healing mechanism; and (5) multi-lifespan design partnership. We conclude with a discussion of overarching considerations for design researchers who engage in cross-boundary research partnership.\n",

For those living with HIV, it is particularly important to have the opportunity to understand when and how their bodies are reacting to certain medications. In this work, we explore how a medication adherence application could help adults with HIV to reflect on their medication tracking behaviors in a way that promotes adherence. We present qualitative data collected through an early design stage activity by means of the Asynchronous Remote Communities (ARC) method, and a survey measuring attitudes toward a prototype application. We discuss two design implications for medication adherence applications: enabling users to record qualitative data that gives context to adherence data, and providing more visual support for reflection on daily medication behaviors.\n",

Instead packages allow users to add new features to their documents while already working on them. They can match the features to their current task at hand. Supporting the reprogrammable nature of Codestrates, new features can also be implemented by users themselves and shared with other people without having to leave the document. We illustrate the application of Codestrate Packages in an example scenario and present its technical concepts.

However, recent work has found that peer-produced VGI is frequently contributed by non-locals. We evaluate this approach across hundreds of content types from Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and eBird, and show that these models can describe more than 90% of \"VGI flows\" for some content types. Our findings advance geographic HCI theory, suggesting some spatial mechanisms underpinning VGI production. We also discuss design implications that can help (a) human and algorithmic consumers of VGI evaluate the perspectives it contains and (b) address geographic coverage variations in these platforms (e.g. via more effective volunteer recruitment strategies).\n",

We will closely look into the basics of navigation, unravelling the psychophysics (including wayfinding) and actual locomotion (travel) aspects. The theoretical foundations form the basis for the practical skillset we will develop, by providing an in-depth discussion of navigation devices and techniques, and a step-by-step discussion of multiple real-world case studies. Doing so, we will cover the full range of navigation techniques from handheld to full-body, highly engaging and partly unconventional methods and tackle spatial navigation with hands-on-experience and tips for design and validation of novel interfaces. In particular, we will be looking at affordable setups and ways to \"trick\" out users to enable a realistic feeling of self-motion in the explored environments. As such, the course unites the theory and practice of spatial navigation, serving as entry point to understand and improve upon currently existing methods for the application domain at hand.\n",

      "Our cultural and scientific understandings of neural networks are built on a set of philosophical ideas which might turn out to be superstitions. Drawing on methodologies of defamiliarisation and performance art which have been adopted by HCI, we present an analog apparatus for the ritualistic performance of neural network algorithms. The apparatus draws on the interaction modes of the Ouija board to provide a system which involves the user in the computation. By recontextualising neural computation, the work creates critical distance with which to examine the philosophical and cultural assumptions embedded in our conception of AI.\n",

      "Charities are subject to stringent transparency and accountability requirements from government and funders to ensure that they are conducting work and spending money appropriately. Charities are increasingly important to civic life and have unique characteristics as organisations. This provides a rich space in which HCI research may learn from and affect both held notions of transparency and accountability, and the relationships between these organisations and their stakeholders. We conducted ethnographic fieldwork and workshops over a seven month period at a charity. We aimed to understand how the transparency obligations of a charity manifest through work and how the workers of a charity reason about transparency and accountability as an everyday practice. Our findings highlight how organisations engage in presenting different accounts of their work; how workers view their legal transparency obligations in contrast with their accountability to their everyday community; and how their labour does not translate well to outcome measures or metrics. We discuss implications for the design of future systems that support organisations to produce accounts of their work as part of everyday practice.support organisations to produce accounts of their work as part of everyday practice.\n",

      "For decades, HCI scholars have studied technological systems and their relationship to particular contexts and user groups. Increasingly, this scholarship is dependent not only on localized contexts, but also the relationship of local contexts to the global stage, drawing on approaches such as ICT4D and cross-cultural design. In this paper, we examine authors' descriptions of study contexts, particularly country information, in paper titles and texts in the CHI Proceedings from 2013 to 2017. We found strikingly different patterns of titling between studies of Western and non-Western countries, including whether and how country names are mentioned in titles, and the precision when describing study contexts. Drawing on critical theories, we analyze how the politics of titling at CHI functions to build categories of \"normal\" and \"exotic.\" We explicate the problems that the current ways of representation bring to knowledge production at CHI, and necessary paths to move forward.\n",

      "We present APPropriate -- a novel mobile design to allow users to temporarily annex any Android device for their own use. APPropriate is a small, cheap storage pod, designed to be easily carried in a pocket or hidden within clothing. Its purpose is simple: to hold a copy of the local content an owner has on their mobile, liberating them from carrying a phone, or allowing them to use another device that provides advantages over their own. Picking up another device when carrying APPropriate transfers all pertinent content to the borrowed device (using local no-cost WiFi from the APPropriate device), transforming it to give the impression that they are using their own phone. While APPropriate is useful for a wide range of contexts, the design was envisaged through a co-design process with resource-constrained emergent users in three countries. Lab studies and a subsequent deployment on participants' own devices identified key benefits of the approach in these contexts, including for security, resource sharing, and privacy.\n",

We present an approach to augmenting conventional and 3D displays with free-space haptic feedback capabilities via a large number of closely-spaced air-vortex-ring generators mounted along the periphery of the display. We then present our ongoing work on building an open-source system based on this approach that uses 16 vortex-ring generators, and show how it could serve as a multimodal interactive interface, as a research tool, and as a novel platform for creative expressions.\n",

We surveyed 82 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers about how they make decisions about revealing personal data while doing tasks. We find that many comply with privacy-invasive information requests for a range of reasons, including benefits outweighing costs, fears of losing access to work, and contributing to scientific research. Several workers also engage in privacy-protective behaviors, motivated by perceptions that the information request is unnecessary or violates policies, as well as concerns about data use and identification. We discuss how our findings can inform policy and design to protect workers' privacy.\n",

This paper reports on hand-labeled playback data obtaining acceptable inter-rater reliability and 100 gameplay features distilled from digital log data. In future work, we will mine these features to automatically identify the CT skills previously labeled by humans.

PHUIs are interfaces built from tangible widgets arranged on the surfaces of physical objects. PHUI layout will become more important as we move from rectangular screens to purpose-built interactive devices. Approaches to PHUI layout based on sculpture make it difficult to reposition widgets, and software approaches do not involve placing widgets on the device exterior. We created PHUI-kit, a software approach to PHUI layout on 3D printed enclosures, which has a drag-and-drop interface, supports repositioning of widgets, and hides implementation details. We describe algorithms for placing widgets on curved surfaces, modifying the enclosure geometry, and routing wiring inside the enclosure.

      "During interventions, surgeons often need to review medical imaging data, e.g., CT scans. Usually, surgeons need to rely on an assistant to browse the images because of sterility requirements. Communication with a substitute operator is tedious and error-prone if the operator does not have an equal level of professional experience and might interrupt the workflow. We present a sensor-integrated shoe allowing surgeons to browse and manipulate 2D medical image data by foot movement. It is portable and wearable. The shoe uses an optical sensor taken from an off-the-shelf computer mouse for tracking the foot movements and an additional micro-switch to turn it on or off. We evaluated the performance of the shoe interface against a control condition with assistant together with ten surgeons in an empirical user study. Our results provide first indications for the effectiveness of a shoe interface in this application area.\n",

      "This paper analyses sexual health workers' 'talk' around their introduction of a digital platform to enhance a regionally managed condom distribution scheme for young people. In examining the discursive resources workers used in framing the sexual health service, their service users and digital technology, we argue that problematic ideologies around young people and sexuality were exercised and reproduced. Workers positioned themselves as the gatekeepers of young people's sexual health, who were in turn constructed as 'mischievous' and 'misguided', with technology having a corruptive role over what was considered to be 'healthy' and 'normal' sexual relationships. We suggest our findings indicate severe challenges in developing community-commissioned platforms alongside service providers, and questions how plausible user participation can be in attempting to conduct collaborative, participatory and engaged work in this context.\n",

Based on ethnographic studies and participatory design activities, we derive three core implications for place- and activity centric library services. These implications led us to design PARTICIPATE in collaboration with library staff from three European countries. The probe is a mean to investigate how place- and activity-centric digital services in the library space can engage participants in co-creating knowledge, and enable libraries to integrate activities with library collections.\n",

      "High latency in an interactive system liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys its usability. In order to reduce end-to-end latency of such systems, it is necessary to analyze and optimize the latency of individual contributors, such as input devices, applica-tions, or displays. We present a simple tool for measur-ing the latency of USB-connected input devices with sub-millisecond accuracy. The tool, based on a Rasp-berry Pi 2 microcomputer, repeatedly toggles a button of a game controller, mouse, or keyboard via an opto-coupler soldered to the button and measures the time until the input event arrives. This helps researchers, developers and users to identify and characterize sources of input lag. An initial comparison of multiple input devices shows differences not only in average latency but also in its variance.\n",

In this paper, we review existing literature on digital and traditional mindfulness to map its design space and synthesize the findings with our prior research on designing for aesthetic needs. We identify \"recollection\" and \"evaluation\" as two important dimensions of mindfulness that have not yet been incorporated into popular digital tools. Through a two-phase design activity over 16 months, we developed ColorAway, an innovative tool that promotes mindfulness through interaction with modified travel photos. Recruited participants evaluated ColorAway and offered unique insights into how mindfulness can be better designed. We also discuss how the process of designing for mindfulness can possibly inform the design of personal technology. This research is part of a larger study that builds on scholarly research and theories with the goal of designing interactive technologies for solo travelers.\n",

These conditions can make it difficult for patients and health care providers to prioritize and manage the treatment of each individual disease. No technological interventions exist to help these patients prioritize and manage the treatments of all their conditions simultaneously. In this paper, we use the barriers patients face and solutions they wish to utilize in managing their conditions and treatments to motivate the design of a mobile application that can be used to help patients successfully manage their conditions. This mobile application allows patients to better understand their conditions and treatments, successfully manage their medications and other treatments, stay connected with their medical and social support networks, and take steps to achieve goals related to their overall health and well-being.\n",

      "Despite the ubiquity of touch-based input and the availability of increasingly computationally powerful touchscreen devices, there has been comparatively little work on enhancing basic canonical gestures such as swipe-to-pan and pinch-to-zoom. In this paper, we introduce transient pan and zoom, i.e. pan and zoom manipulation gestures that temporarily alter the view and can be rapidly undone. Leveraging typical touchscreen support for additional contact points, we design our transient gestures such that they co-exist with traditional pan and zoom interaction. We show that our transient pan-and-zoom reduces repetition in multi-level navigation and facilitates rapid movement between document states. We conclude with a discussion of user feedback, and directions for future research.\n",

      "The purpose of this work's larger project is to investigate if users' basic psychological needs within Self-Determination Theory are satisfied through game design elements over time and if this influences user retention. It is also to be investigated if there is a specific order of satisfaction of these needs. As a preliminary work, 47 participants filled out a survey on their use of gamified fitness- and tracking apps. They were asked about their enjoyment of use, duration and satisfaction of their basic needs. Results showed that users' need for competence seemed to be satisfied in the starting phase, which was also what kept them using it. However, they would eventually quit for reasons unrelated to the apps. Directions for the upcoming diary study are outlined.\n",

      "We share a study on the public adoption the Chibitronics circuit sticker toolkit, an open source, commercially available hardware toolkit for learning and creating electronics on paper. We examine sales data over a two-and-a-half-year period from November 2013, when the kit was launched commercially, to June 2016. We also look at publicly available project documentation from users during this period. We find that the Chibitronics user community confounds norms for traditional technology-making communities, especially in gender demographics. We explore the artifacts and types of documentation produced by users to learn about the various backgrounds, values, and goals of subcommunities, which includes educators, Makers, and crafters. In particular, we focus on artifacts from the craft community as a surprising and distinctive subset of technology creators. The diversity in public engagement shows how paper electronics tools like Chibitronics can be an effective approach for engaging new and broader audiences to participate in technology creation.\n",

      "Operations engineering teams interact with complex data systems to make technical decisions that ensure the operational efficacy of their missions. To support these decision-making tasks, which may require elastic prioritization of goals dependent on changing conditions, custom analytics tools are often developed. We were asked to develop such a tool by a team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where rover telecom operators make decisions based on models predicting how much data rovers can transfer from the surface of Mars. Through research, design, implementation, and informal evaluation of our new tool, we developed principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. We offer these principles as a step towards understanding the complex task of designing these systems. The principles we present are applicable to designers and developers tasked with building analytics systems in domains that face complex operations challenges such as scheduling, routing, and logistics.\n",

      "Despite HCI's interest in topics around sexuality, pornography has remained underexplored. Specifically, the user experience (UX) of technology-mediated pornography has received little attention, even though it has been argued that it may contribute to a better understanding of pleasure and enjoyability of interactive systems. We surveyed 187 participants about a positive experience involving technology-mediated pornography. Autonomy and competence, as well as sexual arousal and desire emerged as the most characteristic dimensions of positive experiences with pornographic content. However, preliminary qualitative analysis suggests that many participants also experienced mixed feelings due to technology. Overall, our findings provide first insights into the complexity of the user experience of technology-mediated pornography.\n",

      "ArabHCI is an initiative inaugurated in CHI17 SIG Meeting that brought together 45+ HCI Arab and non-Arab researchers/practitioners who are conducting/interested in HCI within Arab communities. The goal of this workshop is to start dialogs that leverage our \"insider\" understanding of HCI research in the Arab context and assert our culture identity in design in order to explore challenges and opportunities for future research. In this workshop, we focus on one of the themes that derived our community discussions in most of the held events. We explore the extent to which participatory approaches in the Arab context are culturally and methodologically challenged. Our goal is to bring researchers/practitioners with success and failure stories while designing with Arab communities to discuss methods, share experiences and learned lessons. We plan to share the results of our discussions and research agenda with the wider CHI community through different social and scholarly channels.\n",

      "Stereoscopic display is a standard display mode for virtual reality environments. Typical 3D projection provides only a single stereoscopic video stream; thus co-located users cannot correctly perceive the virtual scene based on their own position and view. Several works devoted to developing multi-user stereoscopic display, but the number of users is very limited or the technical implementation is complicated. In this paper we put forward two flexible and simple projection-based multi-user stereoscopic display systems. The first one, named TPA, is based on a triple-projector array and provides a 120Hz active stereo for three users. Two TPAs can be combined to form a six-user system. The second one, named DPA, is a dual-projector and easy-implemented system providing individual stereoscopic video stream for two to six users. Finally, a co-located multi-user virtual fireman simulation training system and a virtual tennis simulation system were created to verify the effectiveness of our systems.\n",

      "SweepScreen is a digital paintbrush enabling the printing of low-fidelity lasting free form images. It is made of a row of electromagnets that turn on and off in a specific pattern while the user sweeps across the magnetophoretic surface, thus producing a custom image. Despite being low fidelity (black & white, static images), SweepScreen works on passive surfaces to create bistable images. It can therefore replace physical paper on notice boards, packaging or other labeling systems. It can also be used to fast prototype static free form displays to better understand interactions with new display form factors. This could be of interest for the shape-changing community which struggles to access manufactured free form displays. We present our concept and proof-of-concept prototypes that can print images on flat free form surfaces. We show the results of performance evaluations to test the viability of the device and finish with a discussion about current limitations.\n",

Dišimo is a multimodal ambient display that provides feedback about one's stress level, which is assessed through heart rate monitoring. Upon detecting a low heart rate variability for a prolonged period of time, Dišimo plays an audio track, setting the pace of a regular and deep breathing. Users can then choose to take a moment to focus on their breath. By doing so, they will activate the Dišimo devices belonging to their close ones, who can then join for a shared relaxation session.\n",

We are currently analyzing a survey with 403 participants from the US and found that IT processionals have different experiences based on their job role. HCI professionals evaluate the core factors regarding work experience (e.g., having a valuing team, being offered challenges and support, having local role models, and experiencing personal power) more negatively than people in other IT job roles. Based on these first results from our survey, we discuss the role that status differences between job types and the role HCI professionals perform in a product team may play in producing their more negative work experiences. Further analyses and research with product teams are needed to explore these dynamics and potential actions corporations can take.\n",

      "Debates regarding the nature and role of HCI research and practice have intensified in recent years, given the ever increasingly intertwined relations between humans and technologies. The framework of Human-Engaged Computing (HEC) was proposed and developed over a series of scholarly workshops to complement mainstream HCI models by leveraging synergy between humans and computers with its key notion of \"engagement\". Previous workshop meetings found \"engagement\" to be a constructive and extendable notion through which to investigate synergized human-computer relationships, but many aspects concerning the core concept remain underexplored. This SIG aims to tackle the notion of engagement considered through discussions of four thematic threads. It will bring together HCI practitioners and researchers from different disciplines including Humanities, Design, Positive Psychology, Communication and Media Studies, Neuroscience, Philosophy and Eastern Studies, to share and discuss relevant knowledge and insights and identify new research opportunities and future directions.\n",

      "Map users often need to interact repetitively with multiple important locations. For example, a traveler may frequently check her hotel or a train station on a map, use them to localize an unknown location, or investigate routes involving them. Ironically, these location-centric tasks cannot be performed using locations directly; users must instead pan and zoom the map or use a menu to access locations. We propose SpaceTokens, interactive widgets that act as clones of locations, and which users can create and place on map edges like virtual whiteboard magnets. SpaceTokens make location a first-class citizen of map interaction. They empower users to rapidly perform location-centric tasks directly using locations: users can select combinations of on-screen locations and SpaceTokens to control the map window, or connect them to create routes. Participants in a study overwhelmingly preferred a SpaceTokens prototype over Google Maps on identical smartphones for the majority of tasks.\n",

To address this issue, this paper designs and evaluates a light-weight but effective protocol for supporting debate in a classroom activity with university students. It evaluated participants' beliefs on controversial topics (e.g., homeopathy) before and after briefly learning about critical thinking tools, posting arguments, and critically evaluating the arguments of peers. The findings suggest that this intervention led to a statistically significant belief change, and that this change was in the direction of the position best supported by evidence. Consequently, this work in progress presents a constructive approach to scaffold debates in the classroom and beyond.\n",

Research has shown that art-making is an effective way of working with older adults to combat social and health-related issues. We conducted a case study of the interactive art workshop for eight weeks at a local art council. The art workshop consisted of three major activities that integrated with simple interactive techniques: interactive sound painting, light-up card, and interactive soft object. Overall, participants were very engaged throughout all activities. We found that interactive technology in art/crafts activities held great potential for positively engaging older adults and significantly improving their daily lives by inspiring creativity and self-expression, fostering collaborations and intergenerational relationships.\n",

      "Physicians and nurses in intensive care units and operating rooms are responsible for several patients at the same time. However, monitoring multiple patients can be challenging, for example, because staff are moving and vital signs may not be accessible. Therefore, physicians and nurses may not be able to create a full picture of their patients' status - so called situation awareness. The hands-free operability and portability of a head-mounted display could allow physicians and nurses to monitor vital signs constantly and independently of location. We developed an application that displays vital signs of multiple patients on a Vuzix M300 head-mounted display. In this work, we describe the user-centered design approach, implementation, and future evaluation of the application in the operating room at the University Hospital Würzburg.\n",

      "As we move toward commercial usage of ubiquitous computing and augmented reality, it is important to think about how computing should communicate with us when it is distributed in our environment. This paper proposes that qualitative indexical visualizations based on learned understanding of physical phenomena (Experiential Augmentation) can enhance our interaction design language and aid digital interfaces in communicating in a real-world context. We present a study that gathers data on how participants interpret such visualizations, and propose a model with which to analyze their responses. Finally, we also give a set of design recommendations for those interested in creating similar augmentations.\n",

      "In recent times, many public spaces have virtual reality (VR) games for entertainment (e.g., VR amusement parks). Therefore, VR games should be attractive not only for players but also for bystanders. Current VR systems still focus primarily on enhancing the experience of head mounted display (HMD) users; thus, bystanders without an HMD cannot enjoy the experience to the same extent as HMD users. We propose \"ReverseCAVE\" towards a shareable VR experience [1]. This is a proof-of-concept prototype for public VR visualization using CAVE-based projection with translucent screens for bystanders. The screen surrounds the HMD user, and the VR environment is projected onto the screens. Bystanders can see the HMD user and VR environment simultaneously, and capture photographs to share with others. Thus, ReverseCAVE can enhance the bystanders' public VR experience considerably and expand the utility of VR.\n",

We hypothesize that by developing programming environments that align with how manual artists work, we can build procedural systems that enhance, rather than displace, manual art. We present Dynamic Brushes, a programming environment centered around manual drawing. Dynamic Brushes enables the creation of ad-hoc drawing tools that transform stylus inputs to procedural patterns. Applications range from transforming individual strokes to behaviors that draw multiple strokes simultaneously, respond to temporal events, and leverage external data.\n",

Voice has become a widespread and commercially viable interaction mechanism with the introduction of VAs such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, the Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana. Despite their prevalence, the design of VAs and their embeddedness with other personal technologies and daily routines have yet to be studied in detail. Making use of a roundtable, we will discuss these issues by providing a number of VA use scenarios that panel members will discuss. Some of the issues that researchers will discuss in this panel include: (1) obtaining VA data & privacy concerns around the processing and storage of user data; (2) the personalization of VAs and the user value derived from this interaction; and (3) the relevant UX work that reflects on the design of VAs?\n",

Despite this and consumers' expressed desire to curb impulse buying, HCI and consumer behavior research has yet to explore technological interventions to support these consumers. This proposed dissertation draws on various theories of impulse buying to design and experimentally test interventions that either (a) postpone the purchase decision, (b) support budgeting and spending limits, or (c) prompt deeper reflection prior to purchase. Results should shed light on the efficacy of various mechanisms for exerting self-control in e-commerce environments.\n",

      "Distance Cartograms (DC) distort geographical features so that the measured distance between a single location and any other location on a map indicates absolute travel time. Although studies show that users can efficiently assess travel time with DC, distortion applied in DC may confuse users, and its usefulness \"in the wild\" is unknown. To understand how real world users perceive DC's benefits and drawbacks, we devise techniques that improve DC's presentation (preserving topological relationships among map features while aiming at retaining shapes) and scalability (presenting accurate live travel time). We developed a DC-enabled system with these techniques, and deployed it to 20 participants for 4 weeks. During this period, participants spent, on average, more than 50% of their time with DC as opposed to a standard map. Participants felt DC to be intuitive and useful for assessing travel time. They indicated intent in adopting DC in their real-life scenarios.\n",

In this paper, we extend current research on workplace communication and uncover opportunities for technology to support effective work activity reporting. We report on three studies: With a survey of 68 knowledge workers followed by 14 in-depth interviews, we investigated the perceived benefits of different types of progress reports and an array of challenges at three stages: Collection, Composition, and Delivery. We show an important interplay between written and face-to-face reporting, and highlight the importance of tailoring a report to its audience. We then present results from an analysis of 722 reports composed by 361 U.S.-based knowledge workers, looking at the influence of the audience on a report's language. We conclude by discussing opportunities for future technologies to assist both employees and managers in collecting, interpreting, and reporting progress in the workplace.\n",

Implementing a virtual dollhouse in a computer screen offers a more attractive type of play because it removes restrictions on the movements of dolls and the settings of play. However, this method typically compromises the benefits of real doll play. By combining real doll play with a virtual dollhouse, it is possible to incorporate the advantages of both types of play. We develop a virtual dollhouse in a computer display that can be used with real doll play on a tabletop. To connect the real (tabletop) and the virtual (computer display) world, we created a device named \"GetToyIn\" for users to move their toys (dolls) in and out of the virtual dollhouse. Observations of children aged 4 to 10 years old playing with our dollhouse confirmed that they could understand and operate the design model.\n",

In this paper, we introduce the concept of an ideal puppet for storytelling and discuss directions for puppet development.

To see how children and parents would accept the concept, we created a preliminary prototype and conducted user study using Wizard-of-Oz method. Participants experienced enhanced immersion and increased communication between them by through the automatic movement of the puppet. They expected various roles from the puppet such as actor, support tool, and friend, which made various usage scenarios possible. The puppet should be developed in the direction of enhancing its advantages and including various usage scenarios, especially by combining the needs of both automation and manipulation.\n",

We present results from an exploratory study with 7 participants who all played the same game and gave feedback on their emotional experience using this suite of methods. Preliminary results indicated that mixed methods offer complementary strengths in registering player emotion, are useful at different moments of play, and help to accommodate differences in the ways players' emotions manifest. We argue for the value of using multiple methods in evaluating players' emotional response to games.\n",

However, there is a paucity of studies exploring the use of technology for children with ASD in developing countries like Sri Lanka. Therefore, we explore the key considerations for designing software applications for children with ASD by interviewing 32 parents and 18 practitioners of children with ASD. Our findings suggest that to effectively support children with ASD in Sri Lanka, technological interventions should focus on multi-player functionalities to promote social interactions. We further identified the characteristics that are required in a software application to effectively support children with ASD in Sri Lanka, namely support for 1) timers to avoid screen addiction, 2) tangible user interfaces, 3) customization, and 4) cultural context. Based on the results, we provide recommendations to design technology for Sri Lankan children with ASD.\n",

      "CLAW is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. Our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. A servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. Using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. CLAW also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun.\n",

      "Insights from cultural dimensions can be translated into UI guidelines to make technology products locally relevant. Such design suggestions originate from academia but little insight exists in how this knowledge is being applied and tested with global industry products, indicating a gap between research and practice. We contribute two case studies, developed based on work experience and interviews with Product Owners for e-commerce localization in Booking.com and Managing Editors involved in the development for the AI Cortana, Microsoft's intelligent assistant, that provide insight into the efforts to develop or optimize a locally relevant product. These case studies contribute to the academic discussion of the use and usefulness of cultural dimensions by examining the value of existing academic research when applied in specific circumstances. We found that cultural dimensions are used for idea generation, to inform design interventions at a global scale, and to justify personal experiences and intuitions. We also found that designers in industry rely more on personal experiences and knowledge than on the use of cultural dimensions. We discuss the complexities of optimizing for local markets and how insights from the case studies can help to further close the gap between industry and research.\n",

      "Augmented reality (AR) is a new and unexplored means of immersing users in the application they are using, especially games. However, trackerless AR is only now becoming widely available to both users and developers, and there are few guidelines or conventions developers can reference for design heuristics. With the recent push for the creation of more AR apps from the two leading mobile platforms, there is a need to create new heuristic guidelines for user interactions with augmented reality user interfaces (UI). Our research compares and contrasts what could be called a traditional mobile UI, which consists of menu options appearing in screen space, and an AR interface, where the menu options are placed relative to the object they affect. There are recommendations for this type of interaction and starting with small scale tests like ours is the first step to solidifying an interface standard.\n",

      "This paper describes the design and development of Jazzy, a Virtual Reality (VR) application for users with Amblyopia. Jazzy has been designed in collaboration with a target end user of the system from its early stages. Jazzy exploits visual layers to display different contents for each eye on the Head Mounted Display (HMD) screens. In this way, the system becomes a controllable tool to stimulate eyes individually. In addition, taking advantage of the HMD associated controllers, the system is able to track the user in the physical space, enhancing the perceived realism during the VR experience. Users can train hand-eye coordination skills in a more lifelike and engaging manner. Jazzy also provides an interface for caregivers empowering them with a new support tool that can be used alongside classic therapeutic artifacts. In this paper we describe the eye-specific parametric visual stimuli and the caregiver's interface to tune them remotely for plug and play activities that can be experienced at home.This paper describes the design and development of Jazzy, a Virtual Reality (VR) application for users with Amblyopia.

      "Motion-based games for Health (MGH) are increasingly being adopted for stroke rehabilitation because of their inherent benefits [14]. In this paper, we present the initial results of a novel intervention study in Pakistan's context, that compares the benefits of prescribed manual therapy regarding motor functional improvements of 22 participants who participated in a randomized clinical trial that lasted for a period of 4 weeks with the pre-post intervention standard functional assessments (TUG, WMFT, ARAT). The results indicated that adaptive exergames are not just an alternative to manual therapy but can also provide the additional benefits of enjoyment and motivation (TAM, CEGEQ and informal interviews).\n",

In order to enable scientists to perform more interactive experiments, we have developed a JavaScript API and corresponding online IDE which can be used to program interactive computer applications allowing the user to remotely interact with swarms of living single-celled micro-organisms in real time. The API interfaces with several remote microscopes which provide a magnified view of a microfluidic chip housing the microorganisms. We hope this work can be a start towards bringing techniques from HCI into bioengineering and biotechnology development.\n",

      "In a social context where a real human interacts with a virtual human (VH) in the same space, one's sense of social/co-presence with the VH is an important factor for the quality of interaction and the VH's social influence to the human user in context. Although augmented reality (AR) enables the superposition of VHs in the real world, the resulting sense of social/co-presence is usually far lower than with a real human. In this paper, we introduce a research approach employing multimodal interactivity between the virtual environment and the physical world, where a VH and a human user are co-located, to improve the social/co-presence with the VH. A preliminary study suggests a promising effect on the sense of copresence with a VH when a subtle airflow from a real fan can blow a virtual paper and curtains next to the VH as a physical--virtual interactivity. Our approach can be generalized to support social/co-presence with any virtual contents in AR beyond the particular VH scenarios.\n",

      "As highlighted in recent work on remix in online content creation communities, people commonly take and appropriate digital content for new activities. Less is known, however, about how people repurpose digital content as part of work. We report findings from an interview study with 19 individuals in which we explored how digital content in the workplace becomes a material for remix. Our analysis emphasizes (i) how digital content is obtained from colleagues for remix, (ii) how content is made available for remix by others, and (iii) how digital content is transformed for remix. In attending to these broader processes of remix, we consider the roles of workplace technologies, such as those for file sharing, as well as social norms that mediate access, remix, and acknowledgement. We draw implications for design of technology that emphasize support for individuals in making digital content available for remix, and raising awareness of the context of that content.\n",

      "The built environment affects the behaviors and experience of its occupants. Recent technological advances have made it possible to simultaneously quantify features of indoor and outdoor built environments and people's reactions and behaviors within these environments. In a new research methodology, the \"living lab\", aspects of the environment are varied, and people's consequent reactions and behaviors to environmental changes are measured through a combination of objective automated sensing capabilities and behavioral techniques. This approach can be implemented within tightly controlled lab spaces or out in the real world, creating new opportunities to research human-environment interactions across a variety of environments and populations. In this workshop, we highlight the capabilities of the living lab methodology and share how insights from lab and real-world research can inform innovative applications to improve the health, performance, and well-being of building occupants.\n",

      "The emergence of fake news, as well as filter bubbles and echo chambers, has precipitated renewed attention upon the ways in which news is consumed, shared and reflected and commented upon. While online news comments sections offer space for pluralist and critical discussion, studies suggest that this rarely occurs. Motivated by common practices of annotating, defacing and scribbling on physical newspapers, we built a mobile app -- Newsr -- that supports co-annotation, in the form of graffiti, on online news articles, which we evaluated in-the-wild for one month. We report on how the app encouraged participants to reflect upon the act of choosing news stories, whilst promoting exploration, the critique of content, and the exposure of bias within the writing. Our findings highlight how the re-design of interactive online news experiences can facilitate more directed, \"in-the-moment\" critique of online news stories as well as encourage readers to expand the range of news content they read.\n",

Although most of the breaking news are accurate, the news of ongoing events may deliver the misinformation as the circumstances may change. Although the misinformation is corrected afterwards, people tend to be influenced continually by previous misinformation. Therefore, this study aims to find out what characteristics of news chatbot agent are effective in making correction message. The result shows that the silent news chatbot is more likely to lead people to be influenced by misinformation than news chatbot which also mentions a few words when they are required to give information.\n",

While prior work has focused primarily on providing memory triggers or affective cues, mirrorU provides in-situ assessment and interactive feedback to scaffold reflective writing. It automatically and continuously monitors the composition process in three dimensions (i.e., level of detail, overall valence, and cognitive engagement) and provides relevant feedback to support reflection. In a 24-subject pilot deployment, we found that such scaffolding and feedback could help users compose longer reflections with more positive emotion words as well as more insight and causal words. We discuss how the literature on emotional writing informed mirrorU's design, and highlight the major findings as well as the lessons learned from the pilot study.\n",

      "Exergaming has become a successful and certified trend in the gaming, health and fitness sector. However, current commercial and research-based solutions often lack a user-centered, symbiotic design approach covering the physical and virtual design level. Consequently, the player cannot experience a maximum attractive and effective individual as well as social user experience. To contribute to this topic, we present the adaptive exergame \"Plunder Planet\" for children and young adolescents, which can be played as single- and cooperative multiplayer with two different motion-based controllers demanding either haptic or gesture-based input movements. The fitness game environment was designed by an interdisciplinary team of sport scientists, game user researchers, game/industrial/interaction designers and children. So far, \"Plunder Planet\" was evaluated in various study settings, which proof the benefits of the holistic and interdisciplinary design approach.\n",

In order to find out what a fair price is, we designed CalcuCafé, a tool for coffee farmers to calculate their cost of production. An evaluation in Peru uncovered tensions between coffee farmers and cooperative technicians, highlighting barriers to information transparency at the production level. Our ongoing work to address these barriers strives to support the long-term viability of smallholder coffee producers, a sizable yet marginalized group at the intersection of HCI for sustainable agriculture and HCI for development.\n",

ExtensionClip sandwiches the smartphone between two magnets; the front magnet, which tracks the position of the back magnet, triggers touch events on the smartphone»s touchscreen by capacitive coupling. ExtensionClip detects the user»s touch of the back magnet from a change in the size of the touch area on the smartphone»s touchscreen; thus ExtensionClip offers pointing functionality like a mouse. We fabricate an ExtensionClip prototype and conduct user studies. In the first study, we determine the threshold needed to detect the user»s touch on the back magnet. Next, we measure the precision and the selection speed possible with ExtensionClip.\n",

How personal content should be shown is still an important research topic. In this paper, we present PD Notify, a system that mirrors a user's pending smartphone notifications on nearby public displays. Notifications are an essential part of current smartphones and inform users about various events, such as new messages, pending updates, personalized news, and upcoming appointments. PD Notify implements privacy settings to control what is shown on the public displays. We conducted an in-situ study in a semi-public work environment for three weeks with seven participants. The results of this first deployment show that displaying personal content on public displays is not only feasible but also valued by users. Participants quickly settled for privacy settings that work for all kinds of content. While they liked the system, they did not want to spend time configuring it.\n",

      "The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings abundant new opportunities to create more effective and pleasing tangible user interfaces that capitalize on intuitive interaction in the physical world, whilst utilizing capabilities of sensed data and Internet connectivity. However, with these new opportunities come new challenges; little is still known how to best design tangible IoT interfaces that simultaneously provide engaging user experiences and foster a sense of understanding about the often-complex functionality of IoT systems. How should we map previous taxonomies and design principles for tangible interaction into the new landscape of IoT systems? This workshop will bring together a community of researchers from the fields of IoT and tangible interaction, in order to explore and discuss how parallels between tangible interaction and the properties of IoT systems can best be capitalised on as HCI research moves increasingly toward the Internet of Tangible Things (IoTT). Through ideation and discussion, the workshop will function as a springboard for the community to begin creating new taxonomies and design considerations for the emerging IoTT.\n",

      "Whilst there is increasing work investigating the role of digital augmentation of outdoor cultural heritage sites, such augmentations have largely focused on visual and auditory modalities. We present initial findings from a field study of 29 visitors to a Finnish outdoor recreational island who used an exploratory cultural heritage app, augmented with a set of proximity triggered multimodal boxes, to present multimodal and multisensory content (ranging from smell, audio and physical interactions). We outline how this enhanced visitor's experience, as well as practical issues in the use of the boxes, and future development of our work.\n",

      "During the process of design, copies of files are often stored to track changes and design development or to ensure that previous work will not be lost. In software design field, such process is supported using versioning system, where source code is saved intermittently when features are added or modified for individual or group use. We argue that similar versioning system will also benefit the design community when applied to 3D design files, to see how their designs progress and collaborate. In this paper we outline a implemented web based open ecosystem allows designers to similarly collaborate but with a lower bar for adoption than comparable software versioning system. Our system is to be applied to a classroom setting, where architecture students learn to make structural designs; they are then able to see, modify, and give feedback to each other's work.\n",

Some of these approaches have been proven to benefit from the usage of biographical or personalized materials. These contents are not always easy to obtain. Alongside, it is a challenge to maintain awareness of what is meaningful for a certain person. Faced with an absence of tools to collect and manage biographical materials, we created a web platform that supports the work of psychologists, streamlining the collection of relevant information about people with dementia. This knowledge is then used as a starting point to perform reminiscence and other biographical cognitive stimulation practices. In this paper, we present the design of our platform and results from a case study with one psychologist and three patients, across a period of two weeks that showed improvements in the collection of meaningful data about a person, and on maintaining awareness of the therapy as a whole.\n",

In this study, we investigate how additional arms can be used to communicate. While using additional arms to perform physical tasks has been researched, using them to communicate is an area that is largely unexplored. Our study is divided into three stages: a pilot study, implementation, and a user study. In this paper, we discuss our efforts as related to the first two stages of our study. The pilot study was used to determine user expectations for the arms. Participants found the arms effective for describing an area from a fixed location. Users also preferred additional arms that can be controlled and are physically similar to their existing arms. Our prototype consists of a virtual mirror that augments the user's body with additional arms. We discuss future directions for improving our implementation and outline a plan for the user study.\n",

      "Following their introduction in the 1960s, head-mounted VR systems mainly focused on visual and aural senses. In order to enhance immersion in the virtual world, researchers have since pursued the addition of movement and haptics through motion platforms, exoskeletons, and other hand-held devices. From a proliferation of low-cost devices that can sense the user's motion to full body motion capture suits, from gloves to gestures, natural interaction techniques have been desirable and explored in HCI and VR for several years. With virtual reality rapidly becoming accessible to mass audiences, there is growing interest in new forms of natural input techniques to enhance immersion and engagement in multiuser systems. First we need to determine what types of techniques can we design that would integrate well with multiuser experiences. Next, we need to understand the contribution of the designed techniques to the experience, understand how they work with existing controllers, and explore whether they should replace or augment current techniques in order to design more effective and engaging experiences. Finally, it is vital to discern the limitations and the types of application scenarios that are suitable for incorporating the techniques. The aim of this workshop is to deepen and expand the discussion on natural interaction techniques for collaborative VR within the CHI community and promote their relevance and research in HCI.\n",

      "HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness. The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.\n",

      "In this work, we explored the feasibility and accuracy of detecting motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) via implicitly sensing and analyzing users' everyday interactions with their smartphones. Through a 42 subjects study, our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 88.1% (90.0%/86.4% sensitivity/specificity) in discriminating PD subjects from age-matched healthy controls. The performance was comparable to the alternating-finger-tapping (AFT) test, a well-established PD motor test in clinical settings. We believe that the implicit and transparent nature of our approach can enable and inspire rich design opportunities of ubiquitous, objective, and convenient systems for PD diagnosis as well as post-diagnosis monitoring.\n",

      "We present two approaches to sensing objects on a surface, using passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and explain the application of this technology to toy prototypes, Code Maker and Story Maker. In Code Maker, we created a system with an RFID antenna array on a robotic fire truck. The array senses RFID-embedded tiles as they are placed on the truck. Each tile corresponds to a command that is executed by the truck, directing to move, light up, and make sounds. In Story Maker, RFID antennas are embedded in toys that are placed on a mat, underlain with a two-dimensional array of RFID tags. The toys report their position on the mat, which triggers a scene in the story that corresponds to the configuration of toys. We describe the advantages of these RFID implementations as an alternative to other approaches, such as resistive sensing and hardware connectors.\n",

In collaboration with the Museum, we are currently collecting data worldwide and cross-culturally on the digital possessions individuals associate with their romantic break up, combined with the stories behind those possessions. Taking a methodologically innovative approach, we adapt the Museum's existing practices to conduct research (triangulating existing small-scale interview data) whilst simultaneously generating a new collection for the Museum. In doing so, we foreground contemporary HCI questions of ownership, curation, and presentation of self after a romantic breakup to the public. The demo will exhibit the digital possessions and associated stories that we collect, whilst also giving the CHI community the opportunity to contribute to the collection in real-time at the conference, by sharing digital possessions and stories of their own romantic breakups.\n",

      "Longitudinal and large-scale studies have shown a strong link between spatial abilities and success in STEM learning and careers. However, many spatial learning materials are either still 2D-based, or not optimized to engage students. In addition, research in spatial cognition distinguishes many spatial abilities as independent from one another. This implies the need to design content and interactions that target individual spatial abilities in order to further research and support training. Following this approach, we describe the design and implementation for a VR system, \"Keep the Ball Rolling\", controlled with tangible inputs and played as a multi-level game. The system is designed around one central spatial ability: penetrative thinking, which is important in geology, biology, human anatomy, and dentistry among other areas.\n",

Spatial ability has been demonstrated to be malleable and can be improved through training.

This includes placing optional additional assignments in online courses. Learners solve these individual assignments, provide peer reviews for other learners, and give feedback on each review they receive. Based on these data points teams are selected to work on a final paid assignment. Companies offer these assignments and in return receive interview recommendations from the pool of learners together with solutions for their challenges. We report the results of a pilot deployment in an online programming course offered by UC BerkeleyX. Six learners out of 158 participants were selected for the paid group assignment paying $600 per person. Four of these six were invited for interviews at the participating companies Crowdbotics (2) and Telefonica Innovation Alpha (2).\n",

The visualization of the information extracted from these devices, integrated with measures derived from interaction logs, would help therapists monitor the patient's state and attention levels during a WVR experience. The comparison of results along different sessions would facilitate the assessment of patients' improvements. This approach can be exploited to complement more traditional observation-based evaluation methods or clinical tests and can support evidence-based research on the effectiveness of Wearable VR for persons with NDD.\n",

      "Personality affects various social behaviors of an individual, such as collaboration, group dynamics, and social relationships within the workplace. However, existing methods for assessing personality have shortcomings: self-assessed methods are cumbersome due to repeated assessment and erroneous due to a self-report bias. On the other hand, automatic, data-driven personality detection raises privacy concerns due to a need for excessive personal data. We present an unobtrusive method for detecting personality within the workplace that combines a user's online and offline behaviors. We report insights from analyzing data collected from four different workplaces with 37 participants, which shows that complementing online and offline data allows a more complete reflection of an individual's personality. We also present possible applications of unobtrusive personality detection in the workplace.\n",

      "Demand for mental health services often cannot be met, resulting in high costs and lengthy wait times. In response to this problem, technological solutions have been proposed, such as computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) and online peer to peer (P2P) support groups, which have been shown to be effective for non-severe cases of anxiety and depression, and can sometimes exceed the effectiveness on F2F therapy. However, P2P support is often viewed as inferior, and this perception has demotivated participation in existing cCBT P2P platforms by potential peers. To address this perception, we are designing a novel cCBT P2P game that uses gamification techniques to motivate players to participate as helping peers. Specifically, we are examining the Proteus Effect, which purports that a player will adopt qualities of their avatar in a contextual narrative.\n",

The proposed interface offers users a small set of object cues generated automatically tailored to the context of a given video. Users choose which cue to highlight, and the interface in turn fast-forwards the video adaptively while keeping scenes with highlighted cues played at original speed. Our experimental results have revealed that the DO-Scanning arranged an efficient and compact set of cues, and this set of cues is useful for browsing a diverse set of first-person videos.\n",

Meanwhile, a parallel HCI community was formed in 2001 within the Association of Information Systems (AIS SIGHCI) community. While some researchers have already bridged these two HCI sub-disciplines, the history and core values of these respective fields are quite different, offering new insights for how we can move forward together to sustain the future of HCI research. The main goal of this workshop is to begin building a bridge between these two communities to maximize the relevance, rigor, and generalizability of HCI research.\n",

      "Audience feedback is a valuable asset in many domains such as arts, education, and marketing. Artists can receive feedback on the experiences created through their performances. Similarly, teachers can receive feedback from students on the understandability of their course content. There are various methods to collect explicit feedback (e.g., questionnaires) - yet they usually impose a burden to the audience. Advances in physiological sensing opens up opportunities for collecting feedback implicitly. This creates unexplored dimensions in the design space of audience sensing. In this work, we chart a comprehensive design space for audience sensing based on a literature and market review which aims to support the designers' process for creating novel feedback systems.\n",

      "We present an educational activity for college students to think critically about the truthfulness of news propagated in social media. This activity utilizes TwitterTrails, a visual tool to analyze Twitter claims, events, and memes. This tool provides views such as a propagation graph of a story's bursting activity, and the co-ReTweeted network of the more prominent members of the audience. Using a response and reflection form, students are guided through these different facets of a story. The classroom activity was iteratively designed over the course of three semesters. Here, we present the learning outcomes from our final semester's evaluation with 43 students. Our findings demonstrate that the activity provided students with both the conceptual tools and motivation to investigate the reliability of stories in social media. Our contribution also includes access to the tool and materials to conduct this activity. We hope that other educators will further improve and run this activity with their own students.\n",

      "Technology adoption factors such as the protection of autonomy, perceived familiarity, and avoiding anxiety are key to the adoption of mobile technologies by older adults [9]. These factors must be addressed in the design of interactions geared towards this population, else products in this space will fail to be adopted by their intended audience. This paper presents TAGhelper, an interactive tactile aid for tablets that addresses the challenge of adoption of mobile technologies with older adults. TAGhelper seeks to assist older adult users in effectively adopting mobile technologies by providing them with contextually pertinent information about the user's current position in the interface. The interactive tactile aid for tablets proposed in this paper brings together the existing learning preferences of older adults with a tangible and tactile interaction method. By delivering relevant information to the user at the time of need, TAGhelper aims to provide older adults with the means to familiarize themselves with their immediate environment when they become confused by an interface and its functions.\n",

Because privacy is being influenced by socio-cultural factors and shaped by technology, this work argues for a thorough understanding of the home's socio-cultural context. We aim to provide a grounded-in-data, contextual smart home privacy model. The model will be applicable to product and policy design, and also inform future work in privacy research for ubiquitous computing settings.\n",

We describe a co-inquiry, conducted over 16 months with a Parkinson's support group. We explored how the participation of members might be enabled across multiple stages of a research project, from the generation of research questions to the development of a prototype. Participants directed the research into developing alternative modes of information provision, resulting in 'Parkinson's Radio' -- a collectivist health information service produced and edited by members of the support group. We reflect on how we supported participation at different stages of the project and the successes and challenges faced by the team. We contribute insights into the design of collectivist health technologies for this group, and discuss opportunities and tensions for conducting co-inquiry in HCI research.\n",

Inspired by research in the area of feminist studies of technoscience, disaster STS and HCI research into critical and participatory design, I explore novel approaches to making sense of flood hazard, earthquake damage, and sea-level rise that seek provide new ways of engaging with the complexities and uncertainties that characterize the Anthropocene.\n",

However, the design of these technologies often takes a screen-based approach and requires users to adopt new usage conventions. While these methods have been widely successful in helping individuals communicate, we take a step back in this paper and explore the design implications of a simpler tangible system for keeping in touch. This system consists of a pair of artificial electronic flowers, which connect and transmit information to each other. Our contribution is not in the actual implementation, but rather in the design implications that follow. In our modest evaluation we found participants using our system in informal, relaxed and sometimes novel ways.\n",

      "Visual representations are being used in typical sales meetings of the machine industry to exchange information and support social interactions. In these meetings, sales representatives design for granularity by taking into account verbal and visual details of communication. Our article builds on increasingly occurring collocated interactions in sales meetings investigating the social relevance of mobile devices in face-to-face settings. The article aims to understand the supporting and disturbing role of visual granularity in sales meetings and develops design implications for interaction designers. We conducted an ethnographic study of sales meetings in material handling and paper machine industries, including Conversation Analysis (CA) of video recordings, and involving groups of professional analysts that are seldom used in HCI. Our findings draw evidence from sales meetings and design processes on successful and unsuccessful use of granularity in visual representations. Finally, we propose seven design guidelines for visual granularity striving to understand buyers' perceptions and visual qualities.\n",

In this paper, we investigate whether giving people feedback on how long they are away from their task has any effect on the duration and number of their switches. An online experiment was conducted in which participants had to enter numeric codes into an online spreadsheet. They had to look up these codes in an email sent to their personal email address upon starting the experiment. People who were shown how long they were away for made shorter switches, were faster to complete the task and made fewer data entry errors. This suggests feedback on switching duration may make people more aware of their switching behaviour, and assist users in maintaining focus on their main task.\n",

      "Local community ties are an important social resource, but research shows that these ties have been declining. The social significance of location information offers an opportunity address this decline and support local community building. Through this research, we aim to understand if and how passive location sharing might be socially beneficial for communities. We conducted a deployment of MoveMeant, a location awareness app, across three different communities. Following a research through design approach, we conducted 45 interviews with users of the system and community leaders. The findings suggest that communities face issues related to lack of awareness, cohesion, and identity. We show that the app can help increase awareness of important community resources. At the same time, the findings also show a negative effect of surfacing divisions in a community, which we discuss as a intermediate, perceptual step that may contribute to the amplification effect of technology.\n",

Users simply grasp virtual objects and mimic their desired physical movement. The physical properties required to fulfill that movement will then be inferred directly from that motion. We provide a 3D user interface that does not require users to have an abstract model of physical properties. Our approach leverages users' real world experiences with physics. We conducted a bodystorming to investigate users' mental model of physics. Based on our iterative design process, we implemented techniques for inferring mass, bounciness and friction. We conducted a case study with 15 participants with varying levels of physics education. The results indicate that users are capable of demonstrating the required interactions and achieve satisfying results.\n",

In this paper, our goal is to build machine learning models that can predict people»s multi-SNS posting decisions, thus enabling technology that can personalize and augment current SNS use. We explore affordances--the perceived utilities of a SNS»s features-for creating these models. We build an affordance-based model using data collected from a survey about people»s multi-SNS posting behavior (n=674). Our model predicts posting decisions that are ~35% more accurate compared to a random baseline, and ~10% more accurate than predictions based on SNS popularity.\n",

It is not clear, however, whether these measurements are affected by anxiety and stress of the workload, where our informal observations see some participants enjoying the workload and succeeding in tasks, while others worry and struggle with the tasks. This research evaluated the effects of stress on fNIRS measurements and performance, using the Montreal Imaging Stress Task to manipulate the experience of stress. While our results largely support this hypothesis, our conclusions were undermined by data from the Rest condition, which indicated that Mental Workload and Stress were often higher than during tasks. We hypothesize that participants were experiencing anxiety in anticipation of subsequent stress tasks. We discuss this hypothesis and present a revised study designed to better control for this result.\n",

By understanding the relation between changes of musical parameters and users» cognitive and behavioral responses, the designers could better assess the possible cognitive effects caused by their manipulation of these parameters.

      "This paper discusses the effects of multiple viewpoint videos for metacognition of experiences. We present a system for recording multiple users' collaborative experiences by wearable and environmental sensors, and another system for viewing multiple viewpoint videos automatically identified and extracted to associate to individual users. We designed an experiment to compare the metacognition of one's own experience between those based on memory and those supported by video viewing. The experimental results show that metacognitive descriptions related to one's own mind, such as feelings and preferences, are possible regardless whether a person is viewing videos, but such episodic descriptions as the content of someone's utterance and what s/he felt associated with it are strongly promoted by video viewing. We conducted another experiment where the same participants did identical metacognitive description tasks about half a year after the previous experiment. Through the experiments, we found the first-person view video is mostly used for confirming the episodic facts immediately after the experience, whereas after half a year, even one's own experience is often felt like the experiences of others therefore the videos capturing themselves from the conversation partners and environment become important for thinking back to the situations where they were placed.\n",

      "Control interfaces and interactions based on touch-less gesture tracking devices have become a prevalent research topic in both industry and academia. Touch-less devices offer a unique interaction immediateness that makes them ideal for applications where direct contact with a physical controller is not desirable. On the other hand, these controllers inherently lack active or passive haptic feedback to inform users about the results of their interaction. Mid-air haptic interfaces, such as those using focused ultrasound waves, can close the feedback loop and provide new tools for the design of touch-less, un-instrumented control interactions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the growing mid-air haptic research community to identify and discuss future challenges in control interfaces and their application in AR/VR, automotive, music, robotics and teleoperation.\n",

However, simulating accurate behavior in computer generated humans remains a challenge. In this study, we tested the effects of full body behavior (Body Movement and Head Movement) in terms of viewers perception (comfortability with and realism of the computer generated human) using an animated computer generated human in virtual reality. Our findings imply the significant influence of body animation (excluding head animation) on both comfortability and realism of the computer generated human. 37.5% of the participants did not notice the exclusion of the head animation; implying the importance of body animations over head animations. Using the results, we derive guidelines on computer generated human design and realization as well as their influence on the viewer's perception. Finally, we discuss the constraints that should be taken into account when animating in virtual reality.\n",

The data filtering is based on user-viewer relationships. For example, when sharing a 360 video, if the user has an intimate relationship with the viewer, then full fidelity (i.e. the 360 video) of the user's environment is visible. But if the two are strangers then only a snapshot image is shared. By varying the fidelity of the shared content, the viewer is able to focus more on the data shared by their close relations and differentiate this from other content. Also, the approach enables the sharing-user to have more control over the fidelity of the content shared with their contacts for privacy.\n",

Moreover, the algorithmic parameters are determined by probabilistic modeling of human performance in moving target selection tasks.

But, as these activities become richer -i.e. more collaborative, with more open resources, and building upon increasing number of digital tools- planning becomes increasingly important. We conducted contextual interviews with seven middle and high school teachers, about their practices in planning and conducting pedagogical activities. We found that teachers design scripts to guide them through the session and scripts for students to use independently. They adjust their scripts during a session and edit them afterward. They reuse old scripts, adapt scripts from other teachers, and from online and physical sources.We derive implications for the design of scripting tools: sup-porting scripts at multiple levels of detail, or annotations for adjusting scripts during and after teaching sessions.\n",

The co-authors designed the study, oversaw its execution, and analyzed the results, with support from FTC staff. The goals of the research were to assess the effectiveness of methods that online services use to label ads, and to see if alternative methods of labeling ads could improve consumers' ability to recognize them. In a controlled experiment, 48 consumers interacted with both desktop and mobile Web pages that were captured from search and online magazine websites. In half of the conditions, the Web pages were modified based on established Web design guidelines to improve the clarity of ad labeling. The participants' behavior, comments, and eye movements were recorded. Initial findings of this experiment are: (a) consumers cannot always distinguish ads, paid content, and paid search results from unpaid content, and (b) improving the salience and placement of labels based on established UI design guidelines can improve consumers' ability to recognize ads, paid content, and paid search results. We conclude with implications of the results and areas for future research.\n",

However, despite the recent increase in related CHI publication, older adults continue to be underrepresented in HCI research as well as commercially, further widening the digital divide they face and hampering their social participation. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for such research within CHI and related fields such as gerontechnology. For this, we plan to create a space for discussing and sharing principles and strategies to design interactions and evaluate user interfaces for the aging population. We thus welcome contributions to empirical studies, theories, design and evaluation of user interfaces for older adults. Concretely, we aim to: map the state-of-art of senior-centred interaction research, build a multidisciplinary community of experts, and raise the profile of this research within SIGCHI.\n",

      "The tendency to believe and act on others' misinformation is documented in much prior work. This paper focuses on inaccuracy blindness, the tendency to take a collaborator's poor information at face value, which reduces problem-solving success. We draw on social psychological research from the 1970s showing that evaluative rating scales can prompt a change in perspective. In a series of studies, we prototyped and tested an evaluation prompt meant to encourage skepticism in participant detectives trying to identify a serial killer. In tests of the prototype, the prompt was partially successful in inducing skepticism (Exp. 1), but a larger study (Exp. 2) showed that, despite the evaluation prompt, participants' inaccuracy blindness persisted. This work, and the literature more generally, shows that the tendency to be misled by collaborators' inaccurate information remains a strong phenomenon that is hard to counteract and remains a significant challenge for the CHI community.\n",

      "We use smartphones and their apps for almost every daily activity. For instance, to purchase a bottle of water online, a user has to unlock the smartphone, find the right e-commerce app, search the name of the water product, and finally place an order. This procedure requires manual, often cumbersome, input of a user, but could be significantly simplified if the smartphone can identify an object and automatically process this routine. We present Knocker, an object identification technique that only uses commercial off-the-shelf smartphones. The basic idea of Knocker is to leverage a unique set of responses that occur when a user knocks on an object with a smartphone, which consist of the generated sound from the knock and the changes in accelerometer and gyroscope values. Knocker employs a machine learning classifier to identify an object from the knock responses. A user study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of Knocker with 14 objects in both quiet and noisy environments. The result shows that Knocker identifies objects with up to 99.7% accuracy.\n",

      "A prototype process of a physical user interface includes not only connection of electronic parts and an enclosure design, but also the arrangement and configuration of the electronic parts in the enclosure. This process is complicated and difficult for people who do not have modeling skills. We propose ProtoHole, a system for prototyping interactive 3D printed objects using holes, internal cavity and swept-frequency acoustic sensing. By emitting a high-frequency sweep signal inside the object, our system enables to classify changes in resonance properties when closing holes using a machine learning technique. Therefore, an object can be easily made interactive without considering an arrangement of internal electronic parts and wiring. We show examples of prototypes created with our system.\n",

      "Interactive storybooks, such as those available on the iPad, offer multiple ways to convey a story, mostly through visual, textual and audio content. How to effectively deliver this combination of content so that it supports positive social and educational development in pre-literate children is relatively underexplored. In order to address this issue we introduce the \"Counterpointed Triad Technique\". Drawing from traditional literary theory we design visual, textual and audio content that each conveys different aspects of a story. We explore the use of this technique through a storybook we designed ourselves called \"How Far Is Up?\". A study involving 26 kindergarten children shows that \"How Far Is Up?\" can engage pre-literature children while they are reading alone and also when they are reading with an adult. Based on our craft knowledge and study findings, we present a set of design strategies that aim to provide designers with practical guidance on how to create engaging interactive digital storybooks.\n",

      "Advances in mobile and wireless technologies provide new possibilities for supporting K-12 learning activities that can be spatially distributed in the classroom, for example in jointly investigating a scientific phenomenon. Such technologies have an impact on the ways in which students engage with one another, and with the quality of their engagement with the activity itself. This paper uses an embodied approach to understand the patterns of interactions between students (e.g., student-to-student, student-to-teacher) and with computational media within the environment (e.g., student-to-device, student-to-large display), in relation to students' real-time meaning making as they engage in collective inquiry in an immersive simulation environment. The design-based research study consists of two iterations tested in an authentic school setting. We found that increased student-to-student interactions was accompanied by improved observational accuracy and higher quality student explanations constructed. The design implications of the research findings are discussed.\n",

This excludes a large portion of the population affected by privacy implications of technology. In this work, we report on a survey (N=117) in which we studied technology-related privacy concerns of users from different countries, including developing countries such as Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and developed countries such as Germany. By comparing results from those countries, and relating our findings to previous work, we brought forth multiple novel insights that are specific to privacy of users from under-investigated countries.

      "Engaging citizens is a major goal for governments, scientists and businesses, as their participation or lack of it can have a big impact on issues of common interest. This is true in particular for civic technologies such as participatory sensing (PS), which fully relies on citizens' active participation for monitoring tasks. Current research is largely focused on providing incentives to people to increase their participation. Yet, this approach has not proven to be fully effective. Hence, there is a current need to understand the underlying motivations of people to join, participate and abandon PS. I propose to study the dynamics of motivation from a value driven perspective. This research will develop novel civic technology design approaches aimed at enhancing engagement, as well as to environmental data representation, analysis and curation. I aim to advance the understanding of what motivates people to engage in PS in environmental monitoring contexts.\n",

      "Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and IoT have undoubtedly been the largest shapers of the 21st century, changing how people live, think and work. Though, many in the developed world and a few privileged in the developing world can attest to this. Due to illiteracy, socio-economic constraints and unavailability of many non-western languages especially African languages on these mobile devices; majority of the people in developing countries are yet to benefit from these mobile devices. Yet, the rise of powerful artificial intelligence and natural language processing present new opportunities for many users of mobile devices to easily interact with their devices in their own vernacular language. Thus, get the best out of their devices. This paper presents results collected through an online survey across 6 African countries to establish what African users think of existing voice assistants, such as Siri, Google assistant and alike. Additionally, provides recommendations based on our findings that will improve these voice assistants to better understand what Africans say. Therefore, improve the user experience of African users.\n",

      "Previous studies have shown that when individuals join groups for lunch, they tend to conform to the decision of the group. As result, people do not always have the chance to pick the food they wish for, which in turn may have negative consequences, such as not abiding to healthy diets. To address this problem, we created Lunchocracy, an anonymous decision support tool for lunch spots in a workplace based on feedback from a focus group with 7 participants. The tool implements a conversational skype-bot, Lunchbot, that allows users to express interest in joining lunch and to vote for diners to eat at. We deployed the tool for four weeks with 14 participants from the same university department. Post-interviews with 5 participants revealed an overall satisfaction with Lunchocracy, in particular due to it structuring the lunch decision-making and saving time. We discuss how the use of Lunchocracy can positively influence the group's eating dynamics.\n",

In this work, we explore the impact of realtime adjustment of avatar appearance (visual body weight) on player motivation in exergames. Our results draw a mixed picture: while qualitative findings show that players were aware of adaptations, quantitative results do not demonstrate significant differences in player motivation. Instead, observations suggest that players leveraged the mechanic to develop their own meta-game, an effect that needs to be considered when designing mechanics that aim to improve player motivation in exergaming settings.\n",

      "Research on physical representations of data has often used personal data as its focus. Core aim of making personal data physical is to provoke self-reflections through a felt experience. In this paper, we present a preliminary study which employs the idea of gift-giving as a means to explore one's online data. Our main findings report strategies of relating to the data of strangers as well as a conflict between what one thought of their online self and what others were able to find. We discuss how the gifts became platforms for self-reflection, similar to physical data models. Then, we connect that to the engagement of a third person (gift-giver) in the process, highlighting the potential of such involvement. In the future, we focus on how to link people's meaningful artifacts with their personal data.\n",

We conducted a qualitative inquiry of El Paquete through extensive fieldwork---interviews and observations---in Havana, Cuba. Our findings highlight the human infrastructure that supports this offline internet, rendered visible through the lens of articulation work. By offering an in-depth perspective into these workings of El Paquete, we aim to challenge established notions of what an (or the) internet \"should\" look like in more and less \"developed\" contexts. We highlight how El Paquete is a non-standardized and non-neutral internet, but still human-centered. We also offer an enriched understanding of how an entirely offline internet can provide expansive information access to support leisure and livelihood, additionally serving as a locally relevant platform that affords local participation.\n",

      "The recognition process of self-attribution, which is mainly caused by congruence between visual and proprioceptive information and between visual information and prediction from motor commands, has been extensively studied. However, it is still unclear as to which congruence plays the primary role in the process during the voluntary movements. We conducted a user study that distinguishes proprioceptive information and prediction from motor commands by displaying the modified images of the participants' hands in various rotation angles; this introduced the conflict between visual and proprioceptive information. The hand motions of the participants were restricted so that they could predict the visual motion of the images of their hands by the motor command even while the images were rotated. The result indicates that motion prediction plays a primary role in the recognition process of self-attribution, and this predictability depends on the motion pattern and appearance of the hand images.\n",

      "As data increases in dimensionality or complexity, it becomes difficult to graphically represent data items or series in a straightforward way. Chernoff faces encode data values as features of a human face, but afford only a handful of dimensions, and can be difficult to decode. In this paper, we extend and improve Chernoff faces by merging them with the work of landscape painter Bob Ross, creating data-landscapes glyphs that directly encode data as three series with arbitrary numbers of data items per series. This is pretty obviously a bad idea, yet it is difficult to precisely articulate why, given the current state of the art in academic visualization. We propose and evaluate this technique as a way of highlighting these gaps in our ontology of bad visualization ideas, with the goal of being able to dismiss future bad ideas right out of the gate.\n",

      "Live video streaming is becoming an increasingly popular form of interaction in social media, with mobile devices being used for sharing of remote situation \"on the go.\" We are interested in how such forms of interaction can be applied to mobile telepresence, i.e., a quick and effortless way of \"teleporting\" users to a remote location, where they can share each others' viewpoints and collaborate. We developed an application that achieves such effect by taking advantage of spatial data inferred from mobile devices' onboard sensors and embeds realtime video streams into panoramic mixed reality displays. To validate our solution we conducted a preliminary study and observed a statistically significant decrease in cognitive workload as well as increase in spatial and situational awareness among users in comparison with a regular videoconferencing application. Believing in the novelty of our approach, we plan to extend our application with environment mapping and empathic interface functionality.\n",

Amongst others, this includes the fat-finger problem, reachability challenges and the lack of shortcuts. To address these challenges, I explore interaction methods for smartphones that extend the input space beyond single taps and swipes on the touchscreen. This includes interacting with different fingers and parts of the hand driven by machine learning and raw capacitive data of the full interacting hand. My contribution is further broadened by the development of smartphone prototypes with full on-device touch sensing capability and an understanding of the physiological limitations of the human hand to inform the design of fully hand-and-finger-aware interaction.\n",

      "Choptop is an interactive chopping board that provides simple, relevant recipe guidance and convenient weighing and timing tools for inexperienced cooks. This assistance is particularly useful to individuals such as students who often have limited time to learn how to cook and are therefore drawn towards overpriced and unhealthy alternatives. Step-by-step instructions appear on Choptop's display, eliminating the need for easily-damaged recipe books and mobile devices. Users navigate Choptop by pressing the chopping surface, which is instrumented with load sensors. Informal testing shows that Choptop may significantly improve the ease and accuracy of following recipes over traditional methods. Users also reported increased enjoyment while following complex recipes.\n",

      "Playing with toy blocks reveals patterns in children's play that are valuable for therapy and assessment. Following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed young survivors expressing post-trauma stress in block play. Motivated by the limitations in assessing this behavior using traditional methods, our paper describes the design rationales of AssessBlocks, an action-characterizing system using smartwatch embedded toy blocks. Utilizing a smartwatch's Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and capacitive screen, a monitor is able to receive, visualize and document sequential and quantitative play actions that were empirically selected from a preliminary block therapy study on children's post-disaster stress. We also propose our vision of a multi-dimensional behavioral assessment system using actions obtained by AssessBlocks.\n",

This paper compares two distances borrowed from other domains of computer science used in template-based two-dimensional gesture recognizers: the Mahalanobis distance, typically used in computer vision and statistics, and the Jaro-Winckler distance, typically used in information retrieval and pattern recognition. Although the geometric interpretation of these distances is less straightforward for designers, there is a significant impact of the Mahalanobis distance on recognition rate, but not for the Jaro-Winkler one.\n",

      "Fatal overdoses are a common symptom of the opioid epidemic which has been devastating communities throughout the USA for decades. Philadelphia has been particularly impacted, with a drug overdose death rate of 46.8 per 100,000 individuals, far surpassing other large cities' rates. Despite city and community efforts, this rate continues to increase, indicating the need for new, more effective approaches aimed at mitigating and combating this issue. Through a human-centered design process, we investigated motivators and barriers to participation in a smartphone-based system that mobilizes community members to administer emergency care for individuals experiencing an overdose. We discuss evidence of the system's feasibility, and how it would benefit from integration with existing community-based efforts.\n",

      "Smartwatch users often report usability problems despite its handiness and convenience. Fingers often block the screen, and both hands are often required to operate the gadget. To address these issues, we present PairRing, a ring-shaped rotatable smartwatch controller. PairRing allows users to scroll up and down listed items by turning the ring on their index finger with their thumb. To determine the optimal ring shape and rotation speed, we designed and conducted a user study and report the results. We found that (1) users could perform tasks better with the angular ring prototype; (2) the rapid rotation speed was better suited for browsing ordered lists; and (3) overall, participants were positive about the feasibility of the prototype. We conclude with a discussion on the design implications of PairRing as well as its future applications.\n",

      "We present metamaterial textures-3D printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. Metamaterial textures are integrated into 3D printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. Metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. This allows for integrating multiple textures that enable functional objects such as, e.g., a transformable door handle, which integrates tactile feedback for visually impaired users, or a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded to adapt to weather conditions. In our hands-on demonstration, we show our 3D printed prototypes and several samples. Attendees can touch the objects and explore their different textured states.\n",

      "Today, public displays are used to display general purpose information or advertisements in many public and urban spaces. In addition to that, research identified novel application scenarios for public displays. These scenarios, however, mainly include gesture- and posture-based interaction mainly relying on optical tracking. Deploying optical tracking systems in the real world is not always possible since real-world deployments have to tackle several challenges. These challenges include changing light conditions or privacy concerns. In this paper, we explore how smart fabric can detect the user's posture. We particularly focus on the user's arm posture and how this can be used for interacting with public displays. We conduct a preliminary study to record different arm postures, create a model to detect arm postures. Finally, we conduct an evaluation study using a simple game that uses the arm posture as input. We show that smart textiles are suitable to detect arm postures and feasible for this type of application scenarios.\n",

      "The ubiquity of mobile technologies has led communities to engage with environmental and political concerns through collecting, representing, and analysing data. Activist engagement through data collection aims to hold businesses and the state to account--positioning itself against big data and proprietary technologies that foreclose on agency. Design scholars have unique insight to bring as society addresses the ethical and social issues emerging from data-driven technologies and their development. In my dissertation I focus on the design of civic technologies for environmental accountability--map platforms, mapping techniques, and ambient sensor networks for documenting pollution. By adopting an action research framework to investigate these projects, my research examines how critically-informed, participatory practices intervene to build more sustainable and equitable socio-technical systems, contributing an understanding of how these practices can be applied in new contexts.\n",

      "More HCI designs and devices are embracing what is being dubbed \"body centric computing,\" where designs both deliberately engage the body as the locus of interest, whether to move the body into play or relaxation, or to track and monitor its performance, or to use it as a surface for interaction. Most HCI researchers are engaging in these designs, however, with little direct knowledge of how the body itself works either as a set of complex internal systems or as sets of internal and external systems that interact dynamically. The science of how our body interacts with the microbiome around us also increasingly demonstrates that our presumed boundaries between what is inside and outside us may be misleading if not considered harmful. Developing both (1) introductory knowledge and (2) design practice of how these in-bodied and circumbodied systems work with our understanding of the em-bodied self, and how this gnosis/praxis may lead to innovative new body-centric computing designs is the topic of this workshop.\n",

      "In the Internet of Things, not only people interact with objects, but also other objects; creating more complex material landscapes [2]. However, many thing-to-thing interactions are currently designed within a simple and linear paradigm: using mobile devices to remotely control connected objects. With these videos, we aim to explore more complex interrelationships, using a thing-centered design perspective in a speculative way. To this end, we position things within entanglements: fluid assemblages formed and dissolved in a situated way. This shows new possibilities for everyday objects to co-perform tasks, and 'carry' information that can be interpreted further as new perspectives are gained through interaction. Additionally, as entanglements implies a complicated relationship, we aim to provoke a reflection on the conflicts that may arise between things, and the implications of them (mis)interpreting our behavior.\n",

      "Personal Informatics (PI) systems allow their users to collect data from a variety of sources for the purpose of extracting meaningful insights and making positive changes in their lives. Emerging consumer-grade Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)/EEG devices may provide an additional source of data for incorporating into PI systems. To explore users' expectations for brain-related PI systems we provided participants with a consumer-grade BCI headset and prototype mobile application capable of visualizing and recording their brain waves. Participants were interviewed to assess expectations for this type of technology. Our work contributes an understanding of users' various motivations for tracking brain activity data within a personal informatics system. We present our findings so far and discuss their implications for the design of a Cognitive Personal Informatics system, which we intend to deploy in a follow-up longitudinal field study.\n",
