A new chatbot for customer service on social media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025496,587,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anbang-Xu/publication/313204805_A_New_Chatbot_for_Customer_Service_on_Social_Media/links/5a4c7220458515a6bc6c86ef/A-New-Chatbot-for-Customer-Service-on-Social-Media.pdf,"
Users are rapidly turning to social media to request and receive customer service; however, a majority of these requests were not addressed timely or even not addressed at all. To overcome the problem, we create a new conversational system to automatically generate responses for users requests on social media. Our system is integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and is trained by nearly 1M Twitter conversations between users and agents from over 60 brands. The evaluation reveals that over 40% of the requests are emotional, and the system is about as good as human agents in showing empathy to help users cope with emotional situations. Results also show our system outperforms information retrieval system based on both human judgments and an automatic evaluation metric.

"Intersectional HCI: Engaging identity through gender, race, and class",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025766,361,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025766,"
Understanding users becomes increasingly complicated when we grapple with various overlapping attributes of an individual's identity. In this paper we introduce intersectionality as a framework for engaging with the complexity of users' ""and authors"" ""identities"", and situating these identities in relation to their contextual surroundings. We conducted a meta-review of identity representation in the CHI proceedings, collecting a corpus of 140 manuscripts on gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality published between 1982-2016. Drawing on this corpus, we analyze how identity is constructed and represented in CHI research to examine intersectionality in a human-computer interaction (HCI) context. We find that previous identity-focused research tends to analyze one facet of identity at a time. Further, research on ethnicity and race lags behind research on gender and socio-economic class. We conclude this paper with recommendations for incorporating intersectionality in HCI research broadly, encouraging clear reporting of context and demographic information, inclusion of author disclosures, and deeper engagement with identity complexities.

UX design innovation: Challenges for working with machine learning as a design material,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025739,357,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p278.pdf,"
Machine learning (ML) is now a fairly established technology, and user experience (UX) designers appear regularly to integrate ML services in new apps, devices, and systems. Interestingly, this technology has not experienced a wealth of design innovation that other technologies have, and this might be because it is a new and difficult design material. To better understand why we have witnessed little design innovation, we conducted a survey of current UX practitioners with regards to how new ML services are envisioned and developed in UX practice. Our survey probed on how ML may or may not have been a part of their UX design education, on how they work to create new things with developers, and on the challenges they have faced working with this material. We use the findings from this survey and our review of related literature to present a series of challenges for UX and interaction design research and education. Finally, we discuss areas where new research and new curriculum might help our community unlock the power of design thinking to re-imagine what ML might be and might do.

The Pokémon GO experience: A location-based augmented reality mobile game goes mainstream,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025871,293,https://trepo.tuni.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/130011/The_Pok_mon_GO_Experience_2017.pdf?sequence=1,"
Pokémon GO is a location-based augmented reality mobile game based on the Pokémon franchise. After the game was launched globally in July 2016, it quickly became the most successful mobile game in both popularity and revenue generation at the time, and the first location-based augmented reality game to reach a mainstream status. We explore the game experiences through a qualitative survey (n=1000) in Finland focusing on the positive and the negative aspects of Pokémon GO as told by the players. The positive experiences are related to movement, sociability, game mechanics, and brand while the negative experiences emerge from technical problems, unequal gaming opportunities, bad behavior of other players and non-players, and unpolished game design. Interestingly, the augmented reality features, safety issues or the free-to-play revenue model did not receive considerable feedback. The findings are useful for academics and industry practitioners for studying and designing location-based augmented reality game experiences.

Sharevr: Enabling co-located experiences for virtual reality between hmd and non-hmd users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025683,269,http://kucg.korea.ac.kr/new/seminar/2018/ppt/ppt-2018-03-22.pdf,"
Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD) allow for a highly immersive experience and are currently becoming part of the living room entertainment. Current VR systems focus mainly on increasing the immersion and enjoyment for the user wearing the HMD (HMD user), resulting in all the bystanders (Non-HMD users) being excluded from the experience. We propose ShareVR, a proof-of-concept prototype using floor projection and mobile displays in combination with positional tracking to visualize the virtual world for the Non-HMD user, enabling them to interact with the HMD user and become part of the VR experience. We designed and implemented ShareVR based on the insights of an initial online survey (n=48) with early adopters of VR HMDs. We ran a user study (n=16) comparing ShareVRto a baseline condition showing how the interaction using ShareVR led to an increase of enjoyment, presence and social interaction. In a last step we implemented several experiences for ShareVR, exploring its design space and giving insights for designers of co-located asymmetric VR experiences.

Providing haptics to walls & heavy objects in virtual reality by means of electrical muscle stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025600,262,https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/baudisch/projects/mobile_force_feedback/2017-CHI-VRwalls.pdf,"
We explore how to add haptics to walls and other heavy objects in virtual reality. When a user tries to push such an object, our system actuates the user's shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles by means of electrical muscle stimulation, creating a counter force that pulls the user's arm backwards. Our device accomplishes this in a wearable form factor. In our first user study, participants wearing a head-mounted display interacted with objects provided with different types of EMS effects. The repulsion design (visualized as an electrical field) and the soft design (visualized as a magnetic field) received high scores on ""prevented me from passing through"" as well as ""realistic"". In a second study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by letting participants explore a virtual world in which all objects provide haptic EMS effects, including walls, gates, sliders, boxes, and projectiles.

Towards personality-driven persuasive health games and gamified systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025577,264,https://www.academia.edu/download/53181891/p1015-orji.pdf,"
Persuasive games and gamified systems are effective tools for motivating behavior change using various persuasive strategies. Research has shown that tailoring these systems can increase their efficacy. However, there is little knowledge on how game-based persuasive systems can be tailored to individuals of various personality traits. To advance research in this area, we conducted a large-scale study of 660 participants to investigate how different personalities respond to various persuasive strategies that are used in persuasive health games and gamified systems. Our results reveal that people's personality traits play a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. Conscientious people tend to be motivated by goal setting, simulation, self-monitoring and feedback; people who are more open to experience are more likely to be demotivated by rewards, competition, comparison, and cooperation. We contribute to the CHI community by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive games and gamified designs to a particular group of personalities.

Voyager 2: Augmenting visual analysis with partial view specifications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025768,260,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2648.pdf,"
Visual data analysis involves both open-ended and focused exploration. Manual chart specification tools support question answering, but are often tedious for early-stage exploration where systematic data coverage is needed. Visualization recommenders can encourage broad coverage, but irrelevant suggestions may distract users once they commit to specific questions. We present Voyager 2, a mixed-initiative system that blends manual and automated chart specification to help analysts engage in both open-ended exploration and targeted question answering. We contribute two partial specification interfaces: wildcards let users specify multiple charts in parallel, while related views suggest visualizations relevant to the currently specified chart. We present our interface design and applications of the CompassQL visualization query language to enable these interfaces. In a controlled study we find that Voyager 2 leads to increased data field coverage compared to a traditional specification tool, while still allowing analysts to flexibly drill-down and answer specific questions.

The geography of Pokémon GO: beneficial and problematic effects on places and movement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025495,252,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025495,"
The widespread popularity of Pokémon GO presents the first opportunity to observe the geographic effects of location-based gaming at scale. This paper reports the results of a mixed methods study of the geography of Pokémon GO that includes a five-country field survey of 375 Pokémon GO players and a large scale geostatistical analysis of game elements. Focusing on the key geographic themes of places and movement, we find that the design of Pokémon GO reinforces existing geographically-linked biases (e.g. the game advantages urban areas and neighborhoods with smaller minority populations), that Pokémon GO may have instigated a relatively rare large-scale shift in global human mobility patterns, and that Pokémon GO has geographically-linked safety risks, but not those typically emphasized by the media. Our results point to geographic design implications for future systems in this space such as a means through which the geographic biases present in Pokémon GO may be counteracted.

Revolt: Collaborative crowdsourcing for labeling machine learning datasets,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026044,252,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2334.pdf,"
Crowdsourcing provides a scalable and efficient way to construct labeled datasets for training machine learning systems. However, creating comprehensive label guidelines for crowdworkers is often prohibitive even for seemingly simple concepts. Incomplete or ambiguous label guidelines can then result in differing interpretations of concepts and inconsistent labels. Existing approaches for improving label quality, such as worker screening or detection of poor work, are ineffective for this problem and can lead to rejection of honest work and a missed opportunity to capture rich interpretations about data. We introduce Revolt, a collaborative approach that brings ideas from expert annotation workflows to crowd-based labeling. Revolt eliminates the burden of creating detailed label guidelines by harnessing crowd disagreements to identify ambiguous concepts and create rich structures (groups of semantically related items) for post-hoc label decisions. Experiments comparing Revolt to traditional crowdsourced labeling show that Revolt produces high quality labels without requiring label guidelines in turn for an increase in monetary cost. This up front cost, however, is mitigated by Revolt's ability to produce reusable structures that can accommodate a variety of label boundaries without requiring new data to be collected. Further comparisons of Revolt's collaborative and non-collaborative variants show that collaboration reaches higher label accuracy with lower monetary cost.

Examining menstrual tracking to inform the design of personal informatics tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025635,253,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025635,"
We consider why and how women track their menstrual cycles, examining their experiences to uncover design opportunities and extend the field's understanding of personal informatics tools. To understand menstrual cycle tracking practices, we collected and analyzed data from three sources: 2,000 reviews of popular menstrual tracking apps, a survey of 687 people, and follow-up interviews with 12 survey respondents. We find that women track their menstrual cycle for varied reasons that include remembering and predicting their period as well as informing conversations with healthcare providers. Participants described six methods of tracking their menstrual cycles, including use of technology, awareness of their premenstrual physiological states, and simply remembering. Although women find apps and calendars helpful, these methods are ineffective when predictions of future menstrual cycles are inaccurate. Designs can create feelings of exclusion for gender and sexual minorities. Existing apps also generally fail to consider life stages that women experience, including young adulthood, pregnancy, and menopause. Our findings encourage expanding the field's conceptions of personal informatics.

Hello Barbie, CogniToys Dino, and Amazon Echo are part of a new wave of connected toys and gadgets for the home that listen. Unlike the smartphone, these devices are always on, blending into the background until needed. We conducted interviews with parent-child pairs in which they interacted with Hello Barbie and CogniToys Dino, shedding light on children's expectations of the toys' ""intelligence'"" and parents' privacy concerns and expectations for parental controls. We find that children were often unaware that others might be able to hear what was said to the toy, and that some parents draw connections between the toys and similar tools not intended as toys (e.g., Siri, Alexa) with which their children already interact. Our findings illuminate people's mental models and experiences with these emerging technologies and will help inform the future designs of interactive, connected toys and gadgets. We conclude with recommendations for parents, designers, and policy makers.

We identified four dimensions that make remote event viewing engaging: immersion, immediacy, interaction, and sociality. We find that both live streams and the more curated event content found on Snapchat are immersive and immediate, yet Snapchat Live Stories enable quickly switching among different views of the event. Live streams, on the other hand, offer real time interaction and sociality in a way that Snapchat Live Stories do not. However, the interaction's impact depends on comment volume, comment content, and relationship between viewer and broadcaster. We describe how people experience events remotely using these social media, and identify design opportunities around detecting exciting content, leveraging multiple viewpoints, and enabling interactivity to create engaging user experiences for remotely participating in events.

Datasets which are identical over a number of statistical properties, yet produce dissimilar graphs, are frequently used to illustrate the importance of graphical representations when exploring data. This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the benefit of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.

In-air interaction acts as a key enabler for ambient intelligence and augmented reality. As an increasing popular example, exergames, and the alike gesture recognition applications, have attracted extensive research in designing accurate, pervasive and low-cost user interfaces. Recent advances in wireless sensing show promise for a ubiquitous gesture-based interaction interface with Wi-Fi. In this work, we extract complete information of motion-induced Doppler shifts with only commodity Wi-Fi. The key insight is to harness antenna diversity to carefully eliminate random phase shifts while retaining relevant Doppler shifts. We further correlate Doppler shifts with motion directions, and propose a light-weight pipeline to detect, segment, and recognize motions without training. On this basis, we present WiDance, a Wi-Fi-based user interface, which we utilize to design and prototype a contactless dance-pad exergame. Experimental results in typical indoor environment demonstrate a superior performance with an accuracy of 92%, remarkably outperforming prior approaches.

Specifically, we explored whether we could leverage virtual reality technology to teach embodied cultural interaction, such as bowing in Japanese greetings. To evaluate the impact of our virtual reality game designs, we conducted a formative user study with 68 participants. We present results showing that the virtual reality design trained players how and when to bow, and that it increased participants' sense of involvement in Japanese culture. Our results suggest that virtual reality technology provides an opportunity to leverage culturally-relevant physical interaction, which can enhance the design of language learning technology and virtual reality games.

Many people appropriate social media and online communities in their pursuit of personal health goals, such as healthy eating or increased physical activity. However, people struggle with impression management, and with reaching the right audiences when they share health information on these platforms. Instagram, a popular photo-based social media platform, has attracted many people who post and share their food photos. We aim to inform the design of tools to support healthy behaviors by understanding how people appropriate Instagram to track and share food data, the benefits they obtain from doing so, and the challenges they encounter. We interviewed 16 women who consistently record and share what they eat on Instagram. Participants tracked to support themselves and others in their pursuit of healthy eating goals. They sought social support for their own tracking and healthy behaviors and strove to provide that support for others. People adapted their personal tracking practices to better receive and give this support. Applying these results to the design of health tracking tools has the potential to help people better access social support.

Toward this end, we collected eye tracking data from 80 people in a calibration-style task, using two different trackers in two lighting conditions. We found that accuracy and precision can vary between users and targets more than six-fold, and report on differences between lighting, trackers, and screen regions. We show how such data can be used to determine appropriate target sizes and to optimize the parameters of commonly used filters. We conclude with design recommendations and examples how our findings and methodology can inform the design of error-aware adaptive applications.

As algorithmically-driven content curation has become an increasingly common feature of social media platforms, user resistance to algorithmic change has become more frequent and visible. These incidents of user backlash point to larger issues such as inaccurate understandings of how algorithmic systems work as well as mismatches between designer and user intent. Using a content analysis of 102,827 tweets from #RIPTwitter, a recent hashtag-based backlash to rumors about introducing algorithmic curation to Twitter's timeline, this study addresses the nature of user resistance in the form of the complaints being expressed, folk theories of the algorithmic system espoused by users, and how these folk theories potentially frame user reactions. We find that resistance to algorithmic change largely revolves around expectation violation, with folk theories acting as frames for reactions such that more detailed folk theories are expressed through more specific reactions to algorithmic change.

We propose a class of passive haptics that we call Sparse Haptic Proxy: a set of geometric primitives that simulate touch feedback in elaborate virtual reality scenes. Unlike previous passive haptics that replicate the virtual environment in physical space, a Sparse Haptic Proxy simulates a scene's detailed geometry by redirecting the user's hand to a matching primitive of the proxy. To bridge the divergence of the scene from the proxy, we augment an existing Haptic Retargeting technique with an on-the-fly target remapping: We predict users' intentions during interaction in the virtual space by analyzing their gaze and hand motions, and consequently redirect their hand to a matching part of the proxy. We conducted three user studies on haptic retargeting technique and implemented a system from three main results: 1) The maximum angle participants found acceptable for retargeting their hand is 40°, with an average rating of 4.6 out of 5. 2) Tracking participants' eye gaze reliably predicts their touch intentions (97.5%), even while simultaneously manipulating the user's hand-eye coordination for retargeting. 3) Participants preferred minimized retargeting distances over better-matching surfaces of our Sparse Haptic Proxy when receiving haptic feedback for single-finger touch input. We demonstrate our system with two virtual scenes: a flight cockpit and a room quest game. While their scene geometries differ substantially, both use the same sparse haptic proxy to provide haptic feedback to the user during task completion.

For more than two decades, capacitive sensing has played a prominent role in human-computer interaction research. Capacitive sensing has become ubiquitous on mobile, wearable, and stationary devices - enabling fundamentally new interaction techniques on, above, and around them. The research community has also enabled human position estimation and whole-body gestural interaction in instrumented environments. However, the broad field of capacitive sensing research has become fragmented by different approaches and terminology used across the various domains. This paper strives to unify the field by advocating consistent terminology and proposing a new taxonomy to classify capacitive sensing approaches. Our extensive survey provides an analysis and review of past research and identifies challenges for future work. We aim to create a common understanding within the field of human-computer interaction, for researchers and practitioners alike, and to stimulate and facilitate future research in capacitive sensing.

This paper introduces flash organizations: crowds structured like organizations to achieve complex and open-ended goals. Microtask workflows, the dominant crowdsourcing structures today, only enable goals that are so simple and modular that their path can be entirely pre-defined. We present a system that organizes crowd workers into computationally-represented structures inspired by those used in organizations - roles, teams, and hierarchies - which support emergent and adaptive coordination toward open-ended goals. Our system introduces two technical contributions: 1) encoding the crowd's division of labor into de-individualized roles, much as movie crews or disaster response teams use roles to support coordination between on-demand workers who have not worked together before; and 2) reconfiguring these structures through a model inspired by version control, enabling continuous adaptation of the work and the division of labor. We report a deployment in which flash organizations successfully carried out open-ended and complex goals previously out of reach for crowdsourcing, including product design, software development, and game production. This research demonstrates digitally networked organizations that flexibly assemble and reassemble themselves from a globally distributed online workforce to accomplish complex work.

We present the results of a user survey (N=174) in which we investigate actual stories about shoulder surfing on mobile devices from both users and observers. Our analysis indicates that shoulder surfing mainly occurs in an opportunistic, non-malicious way. It usually does not have serious consequences, but evokes negative feelings for both parties, resulting in a variety of coping strategies. Observed data was personal in most cases and ranged from information about interests and hobbies to login data and intimate details about third persons and relationships. Thus, our work contributes evidence for shoulder surfing in the real world and informs implications for the design of privacy protection mechanisms.

The promise of smart environments and the Internet of Things (IoT) relies on robust sensing of diverse environmental facets. Traditional approaches rely on direct and distributed sensing, most often by measuring one particular aspect of an environment with a special purpose sensor. This approach can be costly to deploy, hard to maintain, and aesthetically and socially obtrusive. In this work, we explore the notion of general purpose sensing, wherein a single enhanced sensor can indirectly monitor a large context, without direct instrumentation of objects. Further, through what we call Synthetic Sensors, we can virtualize raw sensor data into actionable feeds, whilst simultaneously mitigating immediate privacy issues. A series of structured, formative studies informed the development of our new sensor hardware and accompanying information architecture. We deployed our system across many months and environments, the results of which show the versatility, accuracy and potential utility of our approach.

On speculative enactments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025503,179,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025503,"
Speculative Enactments are a novel approach to speculative design research with participants. They invite the empirical analysis of participants acting amidst speculative but consequential circumstances. HCI as a broadly pragmatic, experience-centered, and participant-focused field is well placed to innovate methods that invite first-hand interaction and experience with speculative design projects. We discuss three case studies of this approach in practice, based on our own work: Runner Spotters, Metadating and a Quantified Wedding. In distinguishing Speculative Enactments we offer not just practical guidelines, but a set of conceptual resources for researchers and practitioners to critique the different contributions that speculative approaches make to HCI discourse.

What is interaction?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025765,177,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025765,"
The term interaction is field-defining, yet surprisingly confused. This essay discusses what interaction is. We first argue that only few attempts to directly define interaction exist. Nevertheless, we extract from the literature distinct and highly developed concepts, for instance viewing interaction as dialogue, transmission, optimal behavior, embodiment, and tool use. Importantly, these concepts are associated with different scopes and ways of construing the causal relationships between the human and the computer. This affects their ability to inform empirical studies and design. Based on this discussion, we list desiderata for future work on interaction, emphasizing the need to improve scope and specificity, to better account for the effects and agency that computers have in interaction, and to generate strong propositions about interaction.

Dissecting spear phishing emails for older vs young adults: On the interplay of weapons of influence and life domains in predicting susceptibility to phishing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025831,171,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025831,"
Spear phishing emails are key in many cyber attacks. Successful emails employ psychological weapons of influence and relevant life domains. This paper investigates spear phishing susceptibility as a function of Internet user age (old vs young), weapon of influence, and life domain. A 21-day study was conducted with 158 participants (younger and older Internet users). Data collection took place at the participants' homes to increase ecological validity. Our results show that older women were the most vulnerable group to phishing attacks. While younger adults were most susceptible to scarcity, older adults were most susceptible to reciprocation. Further, there was a discrepancy, particularly among older users, between self-reported susceptibility awareness and their behavior during the intervention. Our results show the need for demographic personalization for warnings, training and educational tools in targeting the specifics of the older adult population.

Embodied design ideation practices work with relationships between body, material and context to enliven design and research potential. Methods are often idiosyncratic and due to their physical nature not easily transferred. This presents challenges for designers wishing to develop and share techniques or contribute to research. We present a framework that enables designers to understand, describe and contextualise their embodied design ideation practices in ways that can be understood by peers, as well as those new to embodied ideation. Our framework developed over two conference workshops provides a frame for discussion of embodied design actions that leverage the power of estrangement. We apply our framework to eight embodied design ideation methods. Our contribution is thus twofold: (1) a framework to understand and leverage the power of estrangement in embodied design ideation, and (2) an inspirational catalogue demonstrating the diversity of ideas that embodied design ideation methods can foster.

Understanding blind people's experiences with computer-generated captions of social media images,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025814,165,http://graphics.stanford.edu/~merrie/papers/captions_chi2017.pdf,"
Research advancements allow computational systems to automatically caption social media images. Often, these captions are evaluated with sighted humans using the image as a reference. Here, we explore how blind and visually impaired people experience these captions in two studies about social media images. Using a contextual inquiry approach (n=6 blind/visually impaired), we found that blind people place a lot of trust in automatically generated captions, filling in details to resolve differences between an image's context and an incongruent caption. We built on this in-person study with a second, larger online experiment (n=100 blind/visually impaired) to investigate the role of phrasing in encouraging trust or skepticism in captions. We found that captions emphasizing the probability of error, rather than correctness, encouraged people to attribute incongruence to an incorrect caption, rather than missing details. Where existing research has focused on encouraging trust in intelligent systems, we conclude by challenging this assumption and consider the benefits of encouraging appropriate skepticism.

Citizen sensing is an approach that develops and uses lightweight technologies with local communities to collect, share and act upon data. In doing so it enables them to become more aware of how they can tackle local issues. We report here on the development and uptake of the 'City- Commons Framework for Citizen Sensing', a conceptual model that builds on Participatory Action Research with the aim of playing an integrating role: outlining the processes and mechanisms for ensuring sensing technologies are co-designed by citizens to address their concerns. At the heart of the framework is the idea of a city commons: a pool of community-managed resources. We discuss how the framework was used by communities in Bristol to measure and monitor the problem of damp housing.

Previous research suggests an important role for self-tracking in promoting mental wellness. Recent studies with college student populations have examined the feasibility of collecting everyday mood, activity, and social data. However, these studies do not account for students' experiences and challenges adopting self-tracking technologies to support mental wellness goals. We present two studies conducted to better understand self-tracking for stress management and mental wellness in student populations. First, focus groups and card sorting activities with 14 student health professionals reveal expert perspectives on the usefulness of tracking for three scenarios. Second, an online survey of 297 students examines personal experiences with self-tracking and attitudes toward sharing self-tracked data with others. We draw on findings from these studies to characterize students' motivations, challenges and preferences in collecting and viewing self-tracked data related to mental wellness, and we compare findings between students with diagnosed mental illnesses and those without. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities in leveraging self-tracking for mental wellness, highlighting several design considerations.

Recent research in urban informatics has presented the city as both a complex technological center and a diverse cultural, social, and political entity. However, there has been little research into the changing role that nature plays in urban space, particularly when it comes to understanding how animals have adapted to life in technological and networked cities. In the wake of urbanization, new kinds of cohabitation, including increased interactions between humans and animals, has resulted in new challenges for those working in urban informatics. We leverage key concepts in the Anthropocene-naturecultures, hybrids, and decentering the human in design-to unpack the entanglements of animal-human-computer interaction in two design cases: The Big Cat Behavioral Tracking Initiative and The Phenology Clock. We contribute to urban informatics and HCI research by reflecting on ways in which design can promote new forms of cohabitation and support a broader conception of the city that sees animals as an essential part of the urban landscape.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency which has received increasing interest over the last five years. Built upon a decentralized peer to peer system, it supports transparent, fast, cost effective, and irreversible transactions, without the need for trusting third party financial institutions. We know however little about people's motivation and experience with bitcoin currency. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin users in Malaysia about their experience and trust challenges. Findings show that bitcoins are used more as store of value for speculative investment or savings' protection. The paper advances the HCI theories on trust by identifying main bitcoin characteristics and their impact on trust, such as decentralization, unregulation, embedded expertise, and reputation, as well as transactions' transparency, low cost, and easiness to complete. We discuss insecure transactions, the risk of dishonest traders and its mitigating strategies. The paper concludes with design implications including support for the transparency of two-way transactions, tools for materializing trust, and tools for supporting reversible transactions.

We developed a concept of transformative appetite, where edible 2D films made of common food materials (protein, cellulose or starch) can transform into 3D food during cooking. This transformation process is triggered by water adsorption, and it is strongly compatible with the 'flat packaging' concept for substantially reducing shipping costs and storage space. To develop these transformable foods, we performed material-based design, established a hybrid fabrication strategy, and conducted performance simulation. Users can customize food shape transformations through a pre-defined simulation platform, and then fabricate these designed patterns using additive manufacturing. Three application techniques are provided - 2D-to-3D folding, hydration-induced wrapping, and temperature-induced self-fragmentation, to present the shape, texture, and interaction with food materials. Based on this concept, several dishes were created in the kitchen, to demonstrate the futuristic dining experience through materials-based interaction design.

Thermovr: Exploring integrated thermal haptic feedback with head mounted displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025824,147,,"
Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) provide a promising opportunity for providing haptic feedback on the head for an enhanced immersive experience. In ThermoVR, we integrated five thermal feedback modules on the HMD to provide thermal feedback directly onto the user's face. We conducted evaluations with 15 participants using two approaches: Firstly, we provided simultaneously actuated thermal stimulations (hot and cold) as directional cues and evaluated the accuracy of recognition; secondly, we evaluated the overall immersive thermal experience that the users experience when provided with thermal feedback on the face. Results indicated that the recognition accuracy for cold stimuli were of approx. 89.5% accuracy while the accuracy for hot stimuli were 68.6%. Also, participants reported that they felt a higher level of immersion on the face when all modules were simultaneously stimulated (hot and cold). The presented applications demonstrate the ThermoVR's directional cueing and immersive experience.

The body provides many recognizable landmarks due to the underlying skeletal structure and variations in skin texture, elasticity, and color. The visual and spatial cues of such body landmarks can help in localizing on-body interfaces, guide input on the body, and allow for easy recall of mappings. Our main contribution are SkinMarks, novel skin-worn I/O devices for precisely localized input and output on fine body landmarks. SkinMarks comprise skin electronics on temporary rub-on tattoos. They conform to fine wrinkles and are compatible with strongly curved and elastic body locations. We identify five types of body landmarks and demonstrate novel interaction techniques that leverage SkinMarks' unique touch, squeeze and bend sensing with integrated visual output. Finally, we detail on the conformality and evaluate sub-millimeter electrodes for touch sensing. Taken together, SkinMarks expands the on-body interaction space to more detailed, highly curved and challenging areas on the body.

Current touch input technologies are best suited for small and flat applications, such as smartphones, tablets and kiosks. In general, they are too expensive to scale to large surfaces, such as walls and furniture, and cannot provide input on objects having irregular and complex geometries, such as tools and toys. We introduce Electrick, a low-cost and versatile sensing technique that enables touch input on a wide variety of objects and surfaces, whether small or large, flat or irregular. This is achieved by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material, which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces. We show that our technique is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods, such as spray/brush coating, vacuum forming, and casting/molding enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs. Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects, including those that are laser cut or 3D printed. Through a series of studies and illustrative example uses, we show that Electrick can enable new interactive opportunities on a diverse set of objects and surfaces that were previously static.

As self-driving cars have grown in sophistication and ability, they have been deployed on the road in both localised tests and as regular private vehicles. In this paper we draw upon publicly available videos of autonomous and assisted driving (specifically the Tesla autopilot and Google self-driving car) to explore how their drivers and the drivers of other cars interact with, and make sense of, the actions of these cars. Our findings provide an early perspective on human interaction with new forms of driving involving assisted-car drivers, autonomous vehicles and other road users. The focus is on social interaction on the road, and how drivers communicate through, and interpret, the movement of cars. We provide suggestions toward increasing the transparency of autopilots' actions for both their driver and other drivers.

One of the main barriers to immersivity during object manipulation in virtual reality is the lack of realistic haptic feedback. Our goal is to convey compelling interactions with virtual objects, such as grasping, squeezing, pressing, lifting, and stroking, without requiring a bulky, world-grounded kinesthetic feedback device (traditional haptics) or the use of predetermined passive objects (haptic retargeting). To achieve this, we use a pair of finger-mounted haptic feedback devices that deform the skin on the fingertips to convey cutaneous force information from object manipulation. We show that users can perceive differences in virtual object weight and that they apply increasing grasp forces when lifting virtual objects as rendered mass is increased. Moreover, we show how naive users perceive changes of a virtual object's physical properties when we use skin deformation to render objects with varying mass, friction, and stiffness. These studies demonstrate that fingertip skin deformation devices can provide a compelling haptic experience appropriate for virtual reality scenarios involving object manipulation.

Since its earliest days, harassment and abuse have plagued the Internet. Recent research has focused on in-domain methods to detect abusive content and faces several challenges, most notably the need to obtain large training corpora. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational approach to address this problem called Bag of Communities (BoC)---a technique that leverages large-scale, preexisting data from other Internet communities. We then apply BoC toward identifying abusive behavior within a major Internet community. Specifically, we compute a post's similarity to 9 other communities from 4chan, Reddit, Voat and MetaFilter. We show that a BoC model can be used on communities ""off the shelf"" with roughly 75% accuracy---no training examples are needed from the target community. A dynamic BoC model achieves 91.18% accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts, and uniformly outperforms in-domain methods. Using this conceptual and empirical work, we argue that the BoC approach may allow communities to deal with a range of common problems, like abusive behavior, faster and with fewer engineering resources.

Charts are commonly used to present data in digital documents such as web pages, research papers, or presentation slides. When the underlying data is not available, it is necessary to extract the data from a chart image to utilize the data for further analysis or improve the chart for more accurate perception. In this paper, we present ChartSense, an interactive chart data extraction system. ChartSense first determines the chart type of a given chart image using a deep learning based classifier, and then extracts underlying data from the chart image using semi-automatic, interactive extraction algorithms optimized for each chart type. To evaluate chart type classification accuracy, we compared ChartSense with ReVision, a system with the state-of-the-art chart type classifier. We found that ChartSense was more accurate than ReVision. In addition, to evaluate data extraction performance, we conducted a user study, comparing ChartSense with WebPlotDigitizer, one of the most effective chart data extraction tools among publicly accessible ones. Our results showed that ChartSense was better than WebPlotDigitizer in terms of task completion time, error rate, and subjective preference.

Despite the increasing popularity of head mounted displays (HMDs), development of efficient text entry methods on these devices has remained under explored. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of head-based text entry for HMDs, by which, the user controls a pointer on a virtual keyboard using head rotation. Specifically, we investigate three techniques: TapType, DwellType, and GestureType. Users of TapType select a letter by pointing to it and tapping a button. Users of DwellType select a letter by pointing to it and dwelling over it for a period of time. Users of GestureType perform word-level input using a gesture typing style. Two lab studies were conducted. In the first study, users typed 10.59 WPM, 15.58 WPM, and 19.04 WPM with DwellType, TapType, and GestureType, respectively. Users subjectively felt that all three of the techniques were easy to learn and considered the induced fatigue to be acceptable. In the second study, we further investigated GestureType. We improved its gesture-word recognition algorithm by incorporating the head movement pattern obtained from the first study. This resulted in users reaching 24.73 WPM after 60 minutes of training. Based on these results, we argue that head-based text entry is feasible and practical on HMDs, and deserves more attention.

We describe the meter's iterative development and final design. We detail the security and usability impact of the meter's design dimensions, examined through a 4,509-participant online study. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we found that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback led users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator.

Consumer health technologies have an enormous potential to transform the self-management of chronic conditions. However, it is unclear how individuals use self-tracking technologies to manage them. This in-depth interview study explores self-tracking practices in multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex neurological disease that causes physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. Our findings illustrate that when faced the unpredictable and degenerative nature of MS, individuals regained a sense of control by intertwining self-care practices with different self-tracking technologies. They engaged in disease monitoring, fitness tracking, and life journaling to quantify the body and care for the mind. We focus attention on the role of emotional wellbeing and the experience of control in self-tracking and managing MS. Finally, we discuss in which ways self-tracking technologies could support the experiential nature of control and foster mindful experiences rather than focusing only on tracking primary disease indicators.

By leveraging the verbal instructions, the demonstrated procedures, and the apps? UI hierarchy structures, SUGILITE can automatically generalize the script from the recorded actions, so SUGILITE learns how to perform tasks with different variations and parameters from a single demonstration. Extensive error handling and context checking support forking the script when new situations are encountered, and provide robustness if the apps change their user interface.

360° videos give viewers a spherical view and immersive experience of surroundings. However, one challenge of watching 360° videos is continuously focusing and re-focusing intended targets. To address this challenge, we developed two Focus Assistance techniques: Auto Pilot (directly bringing viewers to the target), and Visual Guidance (indicating the direction of the target). We conducted an experiment to measure viewers' video-watching experience and discomfort using these techniques and obtained their qualitative feedback. We showed that: 1) Focus Assistance improved ease of focus. 2) Focus Assistance techniques have specificity to video content. 3) Participants' preference of and experience with Focus Assistance depended not only on individual difference but also on their goal of watching the video. 4) Factors such as view-moving-distance, salience of the intended target and guidance, and language comprehension affected participants' video-watching experience. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for better 360° video focus assistance.

We experimentally compare the robot to three common smart-home interfaces: a voice-control loudspeaker; a wall-mounted touch-screen; and a mobile application. Our findings suggest that interfaces that rate higher on flow rate lower on usability, and vice versa. Participants' sense of control is highest using familiar interfaces, and lowest using voice control. Situation awareness is highest using the robot, and also lowest using voice control.

We evaluate the performance and usability of mouse-based, touch-based, and tangible interaction for manipulating objects in a 3D virtual environment. This comparison is a step toward a better understanding of the limitations and benefits of these existing interaction techniques, with the ultimate goal of facilitating an easy transition between the different 3D data exploration environments. For this purpose we analyze participants' performance in 3D manipulation using a docking task. We measured completion times, docking accuracy, as well as subjective criteria such as fatigue, workload, and preference. Our results show that the three input modalities provide similar levels of precision but require different completion times. We also discuss our qualitative observations as well as people's preferences and put our findings into context of the application domain of 3D data analysis environments.

Examining crowd work and gig work through the historical lens of piecework,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025974,130,https://ali-alkhatib.com/papers/chi/piecework/pn4226.pdf,"
The internet is empowering the rise of crowd work, gig work, and other forms of on-demand labor. A large and growing body of scholarship has attempted to predict the socio-technical outcomes of this shift, especially addressing three questions: 1) What are the complexity limits of on-demand work?, 2) How far can work be decomposed into smaller microtasks?, and 3) What will work and the place of work look like for workers? In this paper, we look to the historical scholarship on piecework — a similar trend of work decomposition, distribution, and payment that was popular at the turn of the 20th century — to understand how these questions might play out with modern on-demand work. We identify the mechanisms that enabled and limited piecework historically, and identify whether on-demand work faces the same pitfalls or might differentiate itself. This approach introduces theoretical grounding that can help address some of the most persistent questions in crowd work, and suggests design interventions that learn from history rather than repeat it.

Better the devil you know: Exposing the data sharing practices of smartphone apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025556,127,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025556,"
Most users of smartphone apps remain unaware of what data about them is being collected, by whom, and how these data are being used. In this mixed methods investigation, we examine the question of whether revealing key data collection practices of smartphone apps may help people make more informed privacy-related decisions. To investigate this question, we designed and prototyped a new class of privacy indicators, called Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), that expose previously hidden information flows out of the apps. Our lab study of DCIs suggests that such indicators do support people in making more confident and consistent choices, informed by a more diverse range of factors, including the number and nature of third-party companies that access users' data. Furthermore, personalised DCIs, which are contextualised against the other apps an individual already uses, enable them to reason effectively about the differential impacts on their overall information exposure.

Tummytrials: a feasibility study of using self-experimentation to detect individualized food triggers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025480,126,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025480,"
Diagnostic self-tracking, the recording of personal information to diagnose or manage a health condition, is a common practice, especially for people with chronic conditions. Unfortunately, many who attempt diagnostic self tracking have trouble accomplishing their goals. People often lack knowledge and skills needed to design and conduct scientifically rigorous experiments, and current tools provide little support. To address these shortcomings and explore opportunities for diagnostic self tracking, we designed, developed, and evaluated a mobile app that applies a self experimentation framework to support patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in identifying their personal food triggers. TummyTrials aids a person in designing, executing, and analyzing self experiments to evaluate whether a specific food triggers their symptoms. We examined the feasibility of this approach in a field study with 15 IBS patients, finding that participants could use the tool to reliably undergo a self-experiment. However, we also discovered an underlying tension between scientific validity and the lived experience of self experimentation. We discuss challenges of applying clinical research methods in everyday life, motivating a need for the design of self experimentation systems to balance rigor with the uncertainties of everyday life.

Stay cool! understanding thermal attacks on mobile-based user authentication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025461,128,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/170222/1/170222.pdf,"
PINs and patterns remain among the most widely used knowledge-based authentication schemes. As thermal cameras become ubiquitous and affordable, we foresee a new form of threat to user privacy on mobile devices. Thermal cameras allow performing thermal attacks, where heat traces, resulting from authentication, can be used to reconstruct passwords. In this work we investigate in details the viability of exploiting thermal imaging to infer PINs and patterns on mobile devices. We present a study (N=18) where we evaluated how properties of PINs and patterns influence their thermal attacks resistance. We found that thermal attacks are indeed viable on mobile devices; overlapping patterns significantly decrease successful thermal attack rate from 100% to 16.67%, while PINs remain vulnerable (>72% success rate) even with duplicate digits. We conclude by recommendations for users and designers of authentication schemes on how to resist thermal attacks.

Though prior work shows parents worry about screen media experiences displacing physical activity and time outdoors, this research does not account for location-based mobile games like Pokémon GO, which specifically facilitate outdoor activity. To fill this gap in the research, we surveyed and interviewed parents to understand (1) their values and perceptions of this type of gameplay and (2) how they co-play Pokémon GO with their children. Our findings provide empirical evidence that, in addition to appreciating the increased exercise and time outdoors, parents valued how play led to family bonding experiences. Furthermore, some traditional concerns about screen time persisted in this context, and new concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged. Parents mitigated these concerns with rules and gameplay choices, such as maintaining control of the mobile device, to ensure children were safe. This work contributes an empirical understanding of families as co-users of technology and offers a generative lens to study and design for joint media engagement among family members where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.

Psychological distress in the form of depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges among college students is a growing health concern. Dearth of accurate, continuous, and multi-campus data on mental well-being presents significant challenges to intervention and mitigation efforts in college campuses. We examine the potential of social media as a new ""barometer"" for quantifying the mental well-being of college populations. Utilizing student-contributed data in Reddit communities of over 100 universities, we first build and evaluate a transfer learning based classification approach that can detect mental health expressions with 97% accuracy. Thereafter, we propose a robust campus-specific Mental Well-being Index: MWI. We find that MWI is able to reveal meaningful temporal patterns of mental well-being in campuses, and to assess how their expressions relate to university attributes like size, academic prestige, and student demographics. We discuss the implications of our work for improving counselor efforts, and in the design of tools that can enable better assessment of the mental health climate of college campuses.

Gait velocity and stride length are critical health indicators for older adults. A decade of medical research shows that they provide a predictor of future falls, hospitalization, and functional decline among seniors. However, currently these metrics are measured only occasionally during medical visits. Such infrequent measurements hamper the opportunity to detect changes and intervene early in the impairment process. In this paper, we develop a sensor that uses radio signals to continuously measure gait velocity and stride length at home. Our sensor hangs on a wall like a picture frame. It does not require the monitored person to wear or carry a device on her body. Our approach builds on recent advances in wireless systems which have shown that one can locate people based on how their bodies impact the surrounding radio signals. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by comparing it to the gold standard in clinical tests, and the VICON motion tracking system. Our experience from deploying the sensor in 14 homes indicates comfort with the technology and a high acceptance rate.

Prior studies have focused on child interactions in participatory design (PD) with adults and children, but less is known about what specific adult-child interactions constitute a partnership. In this study, we unpack what constitutes an ""equal partnership"" in PD between adults and children. On the basis of prior literature, we created a new framework that examines the complementary roles between children and adults. Next, we analyzed a case study of a year-long intergenerational design team of children (ages 7-11) and adults. From this analysis, we determined that design partnerships are composed of four dimensions that span from unbalanced to balanced interactions: facilitation, relationship building, design-by-doing, and elaborating together. Finally, to demonstrate its utility, we analyzed two focal co-design sessions using our framework. Our analysis suggests that equal partnership in PD is not a single static interaction but a development over time of design interactions influenced by context, experience, and participants.

We compare the gender distribution in photos retrieved by Bing for the query ""person"" and for queries based on 68 character traits (e.g., ""intelligent person"") in four regional markets. Photos of men are more often retrieved for ""person,"" as compared to women. As predicted, photos of women are more often retrieved for warm traits (e.g., ""emotional"") whereas agentic traits (e.g., ""rational"") are represented by photos of men. A backlash effect, where stereotype-incongruent individuals are penalized, is observed. However, backlash is more prevalent for ""competent women"" than ""warm men."" Results underline the need to understand how and why biases enter search algorithms and at which stages of the engineering process.

Today's users communicate via multiple apps, even when they offer almost identical functionality. We studied how and why users distribute their contacts within their app ecosystem. We found that the contacts in an app affect a user's conversations with other contacts, their communication patterns in the app, and the quality of their social relationships. Users appropriate the features and technical constraints of their apps to create idiosyncratic communication places, each with its own recursively defined membership rules, perceived purposes, and emotional connotations. Users also shift the boundaries of their communication places to accommodate changes in their contacts' behaviour, the dynamics of their relationships, and the restrictions of the technology. We argue that communication apps should support creating multiple communication places within the same app, relocating conversations across apps, and accessing functionality from other apps.

Digital technology has been completely integrated into our daily lives, yet the potential of technology to improve its users' life satisfaction is still largely untapped. Mindfulness, the act of paying a deliberate and non-judgmental attention to the present moment, has been shown to have a positive impact on a person's health and subjective well-being--commonly called ""happiness"". Based on an iterative process with meditation teachers and practitioners, we designed a new tool to support mindfulness practices. This tool takes the shape of an augmented sandbox, designed to inspire the user's self-motivation and curiosity. By shaping the sand, the user creates a living miniature world that is projected back onto the sand. The natural elements of the garden are connected to real-time physiological measurements, such as breathing, helping the user to stay focused on the body. Moreover, using a Virtual Reality headset, they can travel inside their garden for a dedicated meditation session. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the system is well suited for mindfulness and induces a calm and mindful state on the user. The meditation teachers envisioned the use of Inner Garden in their practice.

This paper explores the use of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in-car and in-motion for the first time. Immersive HMDs are becoming everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, people will want to use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars. However, their use is confounded by motion sickness caused in-part by the restricted visual perception of motion conflicting with physically perceived vehicle motion (accelerations/rotations detected by the vestibular system). Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conflict. To study this problem, we conducted the first on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a car on the sickness and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers. We established new baselines for VR in-car motion sickness, and found that there is no one best presentation with respect to balancing sickness and immersion. Instead, user preferences suggest different solutions are required for differently susceptible users to provide usable VR in-car. This work provides formative insights for VR designers and an entry point for further research into enabling use of VR HMDs, and the rich experiences they offer, when travelling.

Technology is often viewed as either positive or negative. On one hand, in HCI, weight loss apps are usually seen as a positive influence on users. From the sociocultural perspective, on the other hand, media and technology negatively impact body satisfaction and contribute to eating disorders; however, these studies fail to include weight loss apps. While these apps can be beneficial to users, they can also have negative effects on users with eating disorder behaviors. Yet few research studies have looked at weight loss apps in relation to eating disorders. In order to fill this gap, we conducted interviews with 16 women with a history of eating disorders who use(d) weight loss apps. While our findings suggest these apps can contribute to and exacerbate eating disorder behaviors, they also reveal a more complex picture of app usage. Women's use and perceptions of weight loss apps shift as they experience life and move to and from stages of change. This research troubles the binary view of technology and emphasizes the importance of looking at technology use as a dynamic process. Our study contributes to our understanding of weight loss app design.

Textiles are an old and well developed technology that have many desirable characteristics. They can be easily folded, twisted, deformed, or cut; some can be stretched; many are soft. Textiles can maintain their shape when placed under tension and can even be engineered with variable stretching ability. Conversely, 3D printing is a relatively new technology that can precisely produce functional, rigid objects with custom geometry. Combining 3D printing and textiles opens up new opportunities for rapidly creating rigid objects with embedded flexibility as well as soft materials imbued with additional functionality. In this paper, we introduce a suite of techniques for integrating 3D printing with textiles during the printing process, opening up a new design space that takes inspiration from both fields. We demonstrate how the malleability, stretchability and aesthetic qualities of textiles can enhance rigid printed objects, and how textiles can be augmented with functional properties enabled by 3D printing.

Content shared on social media platforms has been identified to be valuable in gaining insights into people's mental health experiences.

We study the nature of visual attributes manifested in images relating to mental health disclosures on Instagram. Employing computer vision techniques on a corpus of thousands of posts, we extract and examine three visual attributes: visual features (e.g., color), themes, and emotions in images. Our findings indicate the use of imagery for unique self-disclosure needs, quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those shared via the textual modality: expressions of emotional distress, calls for help, and explicit display of vulnerability. We discuss the relationship of our findings to literature in visual sociology, in mental health self disclosure, and implications for the design of health interventions.

Semi-autonomous vehicles occasionally require control to be handed over to the driver in situations where the vehicle is unable to operate safely. Currently, such handover requests require the driver to take control almost instantaneously. We investigate how auditory pre-alerts that occur well before the handover request impact the success of the handover in a dual task scenario. In a study with a driving simulator, drivers perform tasks on their phone while the car is in an autonomous mode. They receive a repeated burst audio pre-alert or an increasing pulse audio pre-alert preceding the standard warning for immediate handover. Results show that pre-alerts caused people to look more at the road before the handover occurred, and to disengage from the secondary task earlier, compared to when there was no pre-alert. This resulted in safer handover situations. Increasing pulse pre-alerts show particular promise due to their communication of urgency. Our detailed analysis informs the design and evaluation of alerts in safety-critical systems with automation.

Mobile virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) allow users to experience highly immersive entertainment whilst being in a mobile scenario. Long commute times make casual gaming in public transports and cars a common occupation. However, VR HMDs can currently not be used in moving vehicles since the car's rotation affects the HMD's sensors and simulator sickness occurs when the visual and vestibular system are stimulated with incongruent information. We present CarVR, a solution to enable VR in moving vehicles by subtracting the car's rotation and mapping vehicular movements with the visual information. This allows the user to actually feel correct kinesthetic forces during the VR experience. In a user study (n = 21), we compared CarVR inside a moving vehicle with the baseline of using VR without vehicle movements. We show that the perceived kinesthetic forces caused by CarVR increase enjoyment and immersion significantly while simulator sickness is reduced compared to a stationary VR experience. Finally, we explore the design space of in-car VR entertainment applications using real kinesthetic forces and derive design considerations for practitioners.

Computer security tools usually provide universal solutions without taking user characteristics (origin, income level, ...) into account. In this paper, we test the validity of using such universal security defenses, with a particular focus on culture. We apply the previously proposed Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) to 3,500 participants from seven countries. We first translate the scale into seven languages while preserving its reliability and structure validity. We then build a regression model to study which factors affect participants' security behavior. We find that participants from different countries exhibit different behavior. For instance, participants from Asian countries, and especially Japan, tend to exhibit less secure behavior. Surprisingly to us, we also find that actual knowledge influences user behavior much less than user self-confidence in their computer security knowledge. Stated differently, what people think they know affects their security behavior more than what they do know.

Quantifying cumulative arm muscle fatigue is a critical factor in understanding, evaluating, and optimizing user experience during prolonged mid-air interaction. A reasonably accurate estimation of fatigue requires an estimate of an individual's strength. However, there is no easy-to-access method to measure individual strength to accommodate inter-individual differences. Furthermore, fatigue is influenced by both psychological and physiological factors, but no current HCI model provides good estimates of cumulative subjective fatigue. We present a new, simple method to estimate the maximum shoulder torque through a mid-air pointing task, which agrees with direct strength measurements. We then introduce a cumulative fatigue model informed by subjective and biomechanical measures. We evaluate the performance of the model in estimating cumulative subjective fatigue in mid-air interaction by performing multiple cross-validations and a comparison with an existing fatigue metric. Finally, we discuss the potential of our approach for real-time evaluation of subjective fatigue as well as future challenges.

How much do visual aspects influence the perception of users about whether they are conversing with a human being or a machine in a mobile-chat environment? This paper describes a study on the influence of typefaces using a blind Turing test-inspired approach. The study consisted of two user experiments. First, three different typefaces (OCR, Georgia, Helvetica) and three neutral dialogues between a human and a financial adviser were shown to participants. The second experiment applied the same study design but OCR font was substituted by Bradley font. For each of our two independent experiments, participants were shown three dialogue transcriptions and three typefaces counterbalanced. For each dialogue typeface pair, participants had to classify adviser conversations as human or chatbot-like. The results showed that machine-like typefaces biased users towards perceiving the adviser as machines but, unexpectedly, handwritten-like typefaces had not the opposite effect. Those effects were, however, influenced by the familiarity of the user to artificial intelligence and other participants' characteristics.

Drones are increasingly being used for various purposes from recording footage in inaccessible areas to delivering packages. A rise in drone usage introduces privacy and security concerns about flying boundaries, what data drones collect in public and private spaces, and how that data is stored and disseminated. However, commercial and personal drone regulations focusing on privacy and security have been fairly minimal in the USA. To inform privacy and security guidelines for drone design and regulation, we need to understand users' perceptions about drones, privacy and security. In this paper, we describe a laboratory study with 20 participants who interacted with a real or model drone to elicit user perceptions of privacy and security issues around drones. We present our results, discuss the implications of our work and make recommendations to improve drone design and regulations that enhance individual privacy and security.

Information visualizations use interactivity to enable user-driven querying of visualized data. However, users' interactions with their internal representations, including their expectations about data, are also critical for a visualization to support learning. We present multiple graphically-based techniques for eliciting and incorporating a user's prior knowledge about data into visualization interaction. We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user's ability to recall and understand the data. We find that participants who are prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when participants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data. We characterize the design space of graphical prediction and feedback techniques and describe design recommendations.

What kind of stories and plots do researchers of Human Computer Interaction draw on when they make fictions? This paper applies the ""basic plots"" identified in the study of literature to scenarios, speculative design and design fiction. Traditional HCI scenarios employ the plot of ""Overcoming the Monster"" where the monster is some problem to be solved. Much of the commentary on critical, speculative or adversarial design also draws on this plot as it attempts to overcome monsters like public apathy or a lack of debate. Design Fiction more frequently takes the form of a ""Voyage and Return"" or a ""Quest"". The paper argues that a better understanding of plot and storytelling could contribute to more reflective research fiction.

Reflective practicum: A framework of sensitising concepts to design for transformative reflection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025516,104,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/212084119.pdf,"
Designing for reflection is becoming an increasingly important part of many HCI systems in a wide range of application domains. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Schön's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.

Organizations across many sectors are under intense pressure to become data-driven. Yet, for mission-driven organizations, the path to becoming and value of being data-driven is not always clear. We present results from an interview-based study of the role of data in the monitoring and evaluation practices of mission-driven organizations. Instead of leading to productive and empowering data-driven decision making, monitoring and evaluation work is characterized by the erosion of autonomy, data drift, and data fragmentation. Together, these consequences of monitoring and evaluation practices play into a cycle of increasing disempowerment for the mission-driven organization. These findings suggest that the design of information systems should work towards empowering organizations in ways that make sense for their unique data needs and those of their constituents.

"Improving dwell-based gaze typing with dynamic, cascading dwell times",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025517,101,http://martezmott.com/pubs/chi-2017-cascading.pdf,"
We present cascading dwell gaze typing, a novel approach to dwell-based eye typing that dynamically adjusts the dwell time of keys in an on-screen keyboard based on the likelihood that a key will be selected next, and the location of the key on the keyboard. Our approach makes unlikely keys more difficult to select and likely keys easier to select by increasing and decreasing their required dwell times, respectively. To maintain a smooth typing rhythm for the user, we cascade the dwell time of likely keys, slowly decreasing the minimum allowable dwell time as a user enters text. Cascading the dwell time affords users the benefits of faster dwell times while causing little disruption to users' typing cadence. Results from a longitudinal study with 17 non-disabled participants show that our dynamic cascading dwell technique was significantly faster than a static dwell approach. Participants were able to achieve typing speeds of 12.39 WPM on average with our cascading technique, whereas participants were able to achieve typing speeds of 10.62 WPM on average with a static dwell time approach. In a small evaluation conducted with five people with ALS, participants achieved average typing speeds of 9.51 WPM with our cascading dwell approach. These results show that our dynamic cascading dwell technique has the potential to improve gaze typing for users with and without disabilities.

In this paper, we explore how to embody mechanical computation into 3D printed objects, i.e., without electronic sensors, actuators, or controllers typically used for this purpose. A key benefit of our approach is that the resulting objects can be 3D printed in one piece and thus do not require assembly. We are building on 3D printed cell structures, also known as metamaterials. We introduce a new type of cell that propagates a digital mechanical signal using an embedded bistable spring. When triggered, the embedded spring discharges and the resulting impulse triggers one or more neighboring cells, resulting in signal propagation. We extend this basic mechanism to implement simple logic functions. We demonstrate interactive objects based on this concept, such as a combination lock. We present a custom editor that allows users to model 3D objects, route signals, simulate signal flow, and synthesize cell patterns.

Current eye-tracking input systems for people with ALS or other motor impairments are expensive, not robust under sunlight, and require frequent re-calibration and substantial, relatively immobile setups. Eye-gaze transfer (e-tran) boards, a low-tech alternative, are challenging to master and offer slow communication rates. To mitigate the drawbacks of these two status quo approaches, we created GazeSpeak, an eye gesture communication system that runs on a smartphone, and is designed to be low-cost, robust, portable, and easy-to-learn, with a higher communication bandwidth than an e-tran board. GazeSpeak can interpret eye gestures in real time, decode these gestures into predicted utterances, and facilitate communication, with different user interfaces for speakers and interpreters. Our evaluations demonstrate that GazeSpeak is robust, has good user satisfaction, and provides a speed improvement with respect to an e-tran board; we also identify avenues for further improvement to low-cost, low-effort gaze-based communication technologies.

Central to this framework is the proposition that our current product-scape should be understood as a distribution of material agencies and best analyzed through the metaphor of ""agency"".

However, little is known about how streamers enter the practice, gain skills, and operate as content producers. We present a qualitative study of an online forum dedicated to streaming.

We find that a key skill in streaming is the development of a unique attitude and persona as a gamer, which permeates into every element of a streamer's performance. As individual identity becomes important in streaming practice, design considerations for platform features such as community moderation and stream metrics may help improve equitable participation in this increasingly important aspect of game culture.

Blind people often need to identify objects around them, from packages of food to items of clothing. Automatic object recognition continues to provide limited assistance in such tasks because models tend to be trained on images taken by sighted people with different background clutter, scale, viewpoints, occlusion, and image quality than in photos taken by blind users. We explore personal object recognizers, where visually impaired people train a mobile application with a few snapshots of objects of interest and provide custom labels. We adopt transfer learning with a deep learning system for user-defined multi-label k-instance classification. Experiments with blind participants demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, which reaches accuracies over 90% for some participants. We analyze user data and feedback to explore effects of sample size, photo-quality variance, and object shape; and contrast models trained on photos by blind participants to those by sighted participants and generic recognizers.

Recently, diseases like H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and Zika virus have created severe crises, requiring public resources and personal behavior adaptation. Crisis Informatics literature examines interconnections of people, organizations, and IT during crisis events. However, how people use technology to cope with disease crises (outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics) remains understudied. We investigate how individuals used social media in response to the outbreak of Zika, focusing on travel-related decisions. We found that extreme uncertainty and ambiguity characterized the Zika virus crisis. To cope, people turned to social media for information gathering and social learning geared towards personal risk assessment and modifying decisions when dealing with partial and conflicting information about Zika. In particular, individuals sought local information and used socially informed logical reasoning to deduce the risk at a specific locale. We conclude with implications for designing information systems to support individual risk assessment and decision-making when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity during public health crises.

Personas often aim to improve product designers' ability to ""see through the eyes of"" target users through the empathy personas can inspire - but personas are also known to promote stereotyping. This tension can be particularly problematic when personas (who, of course as ""people"" have genders) are used to promote gender inclusiveness - because reinforcing stereotypical perceptions can run counter to gender inclusiveness. In this paper we explicitly investigate this tension through a new approach to personas: one that includes multiple photos (of males and females) for a single persona. We compared this approach to an identical persona with only one photo using a controlled laboratory study and an eye-tracking study. Our goal was to answer the following question: is it possible for personas to encourage product designers to engage with personas while at the same avoiding promoting gender stereotyping? Our results are encouraging about the use of personas with multiple pictures as a way to expand participants' consideration of multiple genders without reducing their engagement with the persona.

Interviews and questionnaires showed that HeartChat supports empathy between people, in particular close friends and partners. Sharing heart rate helped them to implicitly understand each other's context (e.g. location, physical activity) and emotional state, and sparked curiosity on special occasions.

Items in social media such as photos may be co-owned by multiple users, i.e., the sharing decisions of the ones who upload them have the potential to harm the privacy of the others. Previous works uncovered coping strategies by co-owners to manage their privacy, but mainly focused on general practices and experiences. We establish an empirical base for the prevalence, context and severity of privacy conflicts over co-owned photos. To this aim, a parallel survey of pre-screened 496 uploaders and 537 co-owners collected occurrences and type of conflicts over co-owned photos, and any actions taken towards resolving them. We uncover nuances and complexities not known before, including co-ownership types, and divergences in the assessment of photo audiences. We also find that an all-or-nothing approach seems to dominate conflict resolution, even when parties actually interact and talk about the conflict. Finally, we derive key insights for designing systems to mitigate these divergences and facilitate consensus.

Recent improvements in ultrasound imaging enable new opportunities for hand pose detection using wearable devices.

Location plays a fundamental role in ergonomics and performance since the anatomical features differ among positions. We also investigate the performance decrease due to cross-session position shifts and develop a technique to compensate for this misalignment. Our gesture recognition algorithm combines image processing and neural networks to classify the flexion and extension of 10 discrete hand gestures with an accuracy above 98%. Furthermore, this approach can continuously track individual digit flexion with less than 5% NRMSE, and also differentiate between digit flexion at different joints.

Remote collaboration can be more difficult than collocated collaboration for a number of reasons, including the inability to easily determine what your collaborator is looking at. This impedes a pair's ability to efficiently communicate about on-screen locations and makes synchronous coordination difficult. We designed a novel gaze visualization for remote pair programmers which shows where in the code their partner is currently looking, and changes color when they are looking at the same thing. Our design is unobtrusive, and transparently depicts the imprecision inherent in eye tracking technology. We evaluated our design with an experiment in which pair programmers worked remotely on code refactoring tasks. Our results show that with the visualization, pairs spent a greater proportion of their time concurrently looking at the same code locations. Pairs communicated using a larger ratio of implicit to explicit references, and were faster and more successful at responding to those references.

Many game designers aim to optimize difficulty to make games that are ""not too hard, not too easy."" However, recent experiments have shown that even moderate difficulty can reduce player engagement. The present work investigates other design factors that may account for the purported benefits of difficulty, such as choice, novelty and suspense. These factors were manipulated in three design experiments involving over 20,000 play sessions of an online educational game. The first experiment (n=10,472) randomly assigned some players to a particular level of difficulty but allowed other players to freely choose their difficulty. Moderately difficult levels were most motivating when self-selected; yet, when difficulty was blindly assigned, the easiest games were most motivating. The second experiment (n=5,065) randomly assigned players to differing degrees of novelty. Moderate novelty was optimal, while too much or too little novelty reduced intrinsic motivation. A final experiment (n=6,511) investigated the role of suspense in ""close games"", where it was found to be beneficial. If difficulty decreases motivation while novelty and suspense increase it, then an implication for educational game designers is to make easy, interesting games that are ""not too hard, not too boring.""

Reading room conditions such as illumination, ambient light, human factors and display luminance, play an important role on how radiologists analyze and interpret images. Indeed, serious diagnostic errors can appear when observing images through everyday monitors. Typically, these occur whenever professionals are ill-positioned with respect to the display or visualize images under improper light and luminance conditions. In this work, we show that virtual reality can assist radiodiagnostics by considerably diminishing or cancel out the effects of unsuitable ambient conditions. Our approach combines immersive head-mounted displays with interactive surfaces to support professional radiologists in analyzing medical images and formulating diagnostics. We evaluated our prototype with two senior medical doctors and four seasoned radiology fellows.

"Designing leaderboards for gamification: Perceived differences based on user ranking, application domain, and personality traits",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025826,94,https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/17645/Jia_2018_designing.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
Leaderboards, a common gamification technique, are used to enhance engagement through social comparisons. Prior research has demonstrated the overall utility of leaderboards but has not examined their effectiveness when individuals are ranked at particular levels or when the technique is applied in different application domains, such as social networking, fitness, or productivity. In this paper, we present a survey study investigating how preferences for leaderboards change based on individual differences (personality traits), ranking, social scoping, and application domains. Our results show that a respondent's position on the leaderboard had important effects on their perception of the leaderboard and the surrounding app, and that participants rated leaderboards most favorably in fitness apps and least favorably in social networking contexts. More extraverted people reported more positive experiences with leaderboards despite their ranking or the application domain. We present design implications for creating leaderboards targeted at different domains and for different audiences.

Rendering the user's body in virtual reality increases immersion and presence the illusion of ""being there"". Recent technology enables determining the pose and position of the hands to render them accordingly while interacting within the virtual environment. Virtual reality applications often use realistic male or female hands, mimic robotic hands, or cartoon hands. However, it is unclear how users perceive different hand styles. We conducted a study with 14 male and 14 female participants in virtual reality to investigate the effect of gender on the perception of six different hands. Quantitative and qualitative results show that women perceive lower levels of presence while using male avatar hands and male perceive lower levels of presence using non-human avatar hands. While women dislike male hands, men accept and feel presence with avatar hands of both genders. Our results highlight the importance of considering the users' diversity when designing virtual reality experiences.

What happened in my home? an end-user development approach for smart home data visualization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025485,94,,"
Smart home systems change the way we experience the home. While there are established research fields within HCI for visualizing specific use cases of a smart home, studies targeting user demands on visualizations spanning across multiple use cases are rare. Especially, individual data-related demands pose a challenge for usable visualizations. To investigate potentials of an end-user development (EUD) approach for flexibly supporting such demands, we developed a smart home system featuring both pre-defined visualizations and a visualization creation tool. To evaluate our concept, we installed our prototype in 12 households as part of a Living Lab study. Results are based on three interview studies, a design workshop and system log data. We identified eight overarching interests in home data and show how participants used pre-defined visualizations to get an overview and the creation tool to not only address specific use cases but also to answer questions by creating temporary visualizations.

Analysts need interactive speed for exploratory analysis, but big data systems are often slow. With sampling, data systems can produce approximate answers fast enough for exploratory visualization, at the cost of accuracy and trust. We propose optimistic visualization, which approaches these issues from a user experience perspective. This method lets analysts explore approximate results interactively, and provides a way to detect and recover from errors later. Pangloss implements these ideas. We discuss design issues raised by optimistic visualization systems. We test this concept with five expert visualizers in a laboratory study and three case studies at Microsoft. Analysts reported that they felt more confident in their results, and used optimistic visualization to check that their preliminary results were correct.

We present GraphScape, a directed graph model of the vi- sualization design space that supports automated reasoning about visualization similarity and sequencing. Graph nodes represent grammar-based chart specifications and edges rep- resent edits that transform one chart to another. We weight edges with an estimated cost of the difficulty of interpreting a target visualization given a source visualization. We con- tribute (1) a method for deriving transition costs via a partial ordering of edit operations and the solution of a resulting lin- ear program, and (2) a global weighting term that rewards consistency across transition subsequences. In a controlled experiment, subjects rated visualization sequences covering a taxonomy of common transition types. In all but one case, GraphScape's highest-ranked suggestion aligns with subjects' top-rated sequences. Finally, we demonstrate applications of GraphScape to automatically sequence visualization presen- tations, elaborate transition paths between visualizations, and recommend design alternatives (e.g., to improve scalability while minimizing design changes).

Implications for adoption,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025742,91,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/84030/1/Implications_forAdoption_post_rebuttal_edits.pdf,"
In this paper we explore the motivations for, and practicalities of, incorporating ""implications for adoption"" into HCI research practice. Implications for adoption are speculations which may be used in research projects to scrutinize and explore the implications and requirements associated with a technology's potential adoption in the future. There is a rich tradition within the HCI community of implementing, demonstrating, and testing new interactions or technologies by building prototypes. User-centered design methods help us to develop prototypes to and move toward designs that are validated, efficient, and rewarding to use. However, these studies rarely shift their temporal focus to consider, in any significant detail, what it would mean for a technology to exist beyond its prototypical implementation, in other words how these prototypes might ultimately be adopted. Given the CHI community's increasing interest in technology-related human and social effects, the lack of attention paid to adoption represents a significant and relevant gap in current practices. It is this gap that the paper addresses and in doing so offers three contributions: (1) exploring and unpacking different notions of adoption from varying disciplinary perspectives; (2) discussing why considering adoption is relevant and useful, specifically in HCI research; (3) discussing methods for addressing this need, specifically design fiction, and understanding how utilizing these methods may provide researchers with means to better understand the myriad of nuanced, situated, and technologically-mediated relationships that innovative designs facilitate.

Real-time ridesharing services (e.g., Uber and Lyft) are often touted as sharing-economy leaders and dramatically lower the cost of transportation. However, how to make these services work better among low-income and transportation-scarce households, how these individuals experience these services, and whether they encounter barriers in enlisting these services is unknown. To address these questions, we onboarded 13 low-income individuals living in transportation-scarce environments to Uber as passengers. Our participants found these services to be reliable and benefited from rich social interactions with drivers; however, barriers such as cost, limited payment methods, and low digital literacy can make such services infeasible. We contribute platform designs that could lead to increased digital literacy and application transparency. To be more inclusive and to reach critical mass, we suggest that these companies foster belief in commons and community trust by coordinating with local businesses in low-resource areas with lower digital literacy.

Self-experimentation for behavior change: Design and formative evaluation of two approaches,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026038,89,https://erinwalker.owlstown.net/publications/56.pdf,"
Desirable outcomes such as health are tightly linked to behaviors, thus inspiring research on technologies that support people in changing those behaviors. Many behavior-change technologies are designed by HCI experts but this approach can make it difficult to personalize support to each user's unique goals and needs. This paper reports on the iterative design of two complementary support strategies for helping users create their own personalized behavior-change plans via self-experimentation: One emphasized the use of interactive instructional materials, and the other additionally introduced context-aware computing to enable user creation of ""just in time"" home-based interventions. In a formative trial with 27 users, we compared these two approaches to an unstructured sleep education control. Results suggest great promise in both strategies and provide insights on how to develop personalized behavior-change technologies.

HCI is focused on improving the interactions we have with technology and innovating new types of interactions, as well as expanding the types of people for whom those interactions are designed. Central to these efforts is the simultaneously empowering and contested construct of the ""user."" This paper examines what the construct of the user highlights, as well as what it conceals. We introduce post-userism, a perspective that simultaneously acknowledges the limits of, and proposes alternatives to, the central construct of the user as proxy for the ""human"" in HCI. Drawing on developments across the historical trajectory of HCI, we articulate how the user is enacted across four different levels of representation-systems, interface, design process, and the ideology and identify situations where the user breaks down. Synthesizing prior work, we offer a series of strategies for grappling with such situations. In doing so, we seek to overcome the limitations imposed by the user and develop a language that will aid in evolving the foundations of HCI by asking what, exactly, we place at the center of our scholarship and design.

Obtaining information about audience engagement in presentations is a valuable asset for presenters in many domains. Prior literature mostly utilized explicit methods of collecting feedback which induce distractions, add workload on audience and do not provide objective information to presenters. We present EngageMeter - a system that allows fine-grained information on audience engagement to be obtained implicitly from multiple brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and to be fed back to presenters for real time and post-hoc access. Through evaluation during an HCI conference (Naudience=11, Npresenters=3) we found that EngageMeter provides value to presenters (a) in real-time, since it allows reacting to current engagement scores by changing tone or adding pauses, and (b) in post-hoc, since presenters can adjust their slides and embed extra elements. We discuss how EngageMeter can be used in collocated and distributed audience sensing as well as how it can aid presenters in long term use.

Sleep is an important aspect of our health, but it is difficult for people to track manually because it is an unconscious activity. The ability to sense sleep has aimed to lower the barriers of tracking sleep. Although sleep sensors are widely available, their usefulness and potential to promote healthy sleep behaviors has not been fully realized. To understand people's perspectives on sleep sensing devices and their potential for promoting sleep health, we surveyed 87 and interviewed 12 people who currently use or have previously used sleep sensors, interviewed 5 sleep medical experts, and conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of 6986 reviews of the most popular commercial sleep sensing technologies. We found that the feedback provided by current sleep sensing technologies affects users' perceptions of their sleep and encourages goals that are in tension with evidence-based methods for promoting good sleep health. Our research provides design recommendations for improving the feedback of sleep sensing technologies by bridging the gap between expert and user goals.

Printflatables is a design and fabrication system for human-scale, functional and dynamic inflatable objects. We use inextensible thermoplastic fabric as the raw material with the key principle of introducing folds and thermal sealing. Upon inflation, the sealed object takes the expected three dimensional shape. The workflow begins with the user specifying an intended 3D model which is decomposed to two dimensional fabrication geometry. This forms the input for a numerically controlled thermal contact iron that seals layers of thermoplastic fabric. In this paper, we discuss the system design in detail, the pneumatic primitives that this technique enables and merits of being able to make large, functional and dynamic pneumatic artifacts. We demonstrate the design output through multiple objects which could motivate fabrication of inflatable media and pressure-based interfaces.

Various forms of artificial intelligence (AI), such as Apple's Siri and Google Now, have permeated our everyday lives. However, the advent of such ""human-like"" technology has stirred both awe and a great deal of fear. Many consider it a woe to have an unimaginable future where human intelligence is exceeded by AI. This paper investigates how people perceive and understand AI with a case study of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, in March 2016. This study explores the underlying and changing perspectives toward AI as users experienced this historic event. Interviews with 22 participants show that users tacitly refer to AlphaGo as an ""other"" as if it were comparable to a human, while dreading that it would come back to them as a potential existential threat. Our work illustrates a confrontational relationship between users and AI, and suggests the need to prepare for a new kind of user experience in this nascent socio- technological change. It calls for a collaborative research effort from the HCI community to study and accommodate users for a future where they interact with algorithms, not just interfaces.

With the rapid growth of ICT adoption in the Global South, crimes over and through digital technologies have also increased. Consequently, governments have begun to undertake a variety of different surveillance programs, which in turn provoke questions regarding citizens' privacy rights. However, both the concepts of privacy and of citizens' corresponding political rights have not been well-developed in HCI for non-Western contexts. This paper presents findings from a three-month long ethnography and online survey (n=606) conducted in Bangladesh, where the government recently imposed mandatory biometric registration for every mobile phone user. Our analysis surfaces important privacy and safety concerns regarding identity, ownership, and trust, and reveals the cultural and political challenges of imposing biometric registration program in Bangladesh. We also discuss how alternative designs of infrastructure, technology, and policy may better meet stakeholders' competing needs in the Global South.

In this research, we address this gap through a qualitative study of 32 users of WeRun--a fitness plugin of the widely adopted Chinese mobile social networking service WeChat. Our findings indicate that sharing fitness data with pre-existing social networks motivates users to continue self-tracking and enhances their existing social relationships. Nevertheless, users' concerns about their online personal images lead to challenges around privacy.

Can unicorns help users compare crypto key fingerprints?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025733,85,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025733,"
Many authentication schemes ask users to manually compare compact representations of cryptographic keys, known as fingerprints. If the fingerprints do not match, that may signal a man-in-the-middle attack. An adversary performing an attack may use a fingerprint that is similar to the target fingerprint, but not an exact match, to try to fool inattentive users. Fingerprint representations should thus be both usable and secure. We tested the usability and security of eight fingerprint representations under different configurations. In a 661-participant between-subjects experiment, participants compared fingerprints under realistic conditions and were subjected to a simulated attack. The best configuration allowed attacks to succeed 6% of the time; the worst 72%. We find the seemingly effective compare-and-select approach performs poorly for key fingerprints and that graphical fingerprint representations, while intuitive and fast, vary in performance. We identify some fingerprint representations as particularly promising.

Vibrotactile actuation is mainly used to deliver buzzing sensations. But if vibrotactile actuation is tightly coupled to users' actions, it can be used to create much richer haptic experiences. It is not well understood, however, how this coupling should be done or which vibrotactile parameters create which experiences. To investigate how actuation parameters relate to haptic experiences, we built a physical slider with minimal native friction, a vibrotactile actuator and an integrated position sensor. By vibrating the slider as it is moved, we create an experience of texture between the sliding element and its track. We conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how granularity, amplitude and timbre relate to the experiences of roughness, adhesiveness, sharpness and bumpiness. We found that amplitude influences the strength of the perceived texture, while variations in granularity and timbre create distinct experiences. Our study underlines the importance of action in haptic perception and suggests strategies for deploying such tightly coupled feedback in everyday devices.

Workplace health and wellness programs are increasingly integrating personal health tracking technologies, such as Fitbit and Apple Watch.

We conducted a study to understand how tracking tools are adopted in wellness programs and employees' opinions about these programs. We find that employees are generally positive about incentivized health tracking in the workplace, as it helps raise awareness of activity levels. However, there is a gap between the intentions of the programs and individual experiences and health goals. This sometimes results in confusion and creates barriers to participation. Even if this gap can be addressed, health tracking in the workplace will not be for everyone; this has implications for the design of both workplace wellness programs and tracking technologies.

Helpstone provides several new communication channels that allow for a better viewer-streamer interaction. We evaluated the tool within a live-streaming session with 23 viewers using Helpstone, and interviewed the streamer. The results indicate that not every implemented interactivity option is relevant. However, in general, new communication channels appear to be valuable and novel influence options are appreciated.

Social media sites are challenged by both the scale and variety of deviant behavior online. While algorithms can detect spam and obscenity, behaviors that break community guidelines on some sites are difficult because they have multimodal subtleties (images and/or text). Identifying these posts is often regulated to a few moderators. In this paper, we develop a deep learning classifier that jointly models textual and visual characteristics of pro-eating disorder content that violates community guidelines. Using a million Tumblr photo posts, our classifier discovers deviant content efficiently while also maintaining high recall (85%). Our approach uses human sensitivity throughout to guide the creation, curation, and understanding of this approach to challenging, deviant content. We discuss how automation might impact community moderation, and the ethical and social obligations of this area.

They reported frustrations including a perceived decline in cognitive abilities, lack of opportunities to interact with tutors and peers, and trouble dealing with constantly-changing software technologies. Based on these findings, we propose a learner-centered design of techniques and tools for motivating older adults to learn programming and discuss broader societal implications of a future where more older adults have access to computer programming -- not merely computer literacy -- as a skill set.

Animal conservation organisations occasionally harness depictions of animals using digital technology to inspire interest in, and concern for animals. To better understand the forms of empathy experienced by people observing animal-computer interaction, we designed and studied an interactive installation for orangutans at a zoo. Through collaborative design we established an understanding of zoos' objectives and strategies related to empathy in the zoo context. We deployed a prototype installation, and observed and interviewed visitors who watched orangutans use the installation. Analysis of observations and interviews revealed that visitors responded with cognitive, affective and motor empathy for the animals. We propose that these empathetic responses are prompted by the visibility of orangutans' bodily movements, by the ""anthropic frame"" provided by digital technology, and by prompting reflection on animals' cognitive processes and affective states. This paper contributes new evidence and understanding of people's empathetic responses to observing animal-computer interaction and confirms the value of designing for empathy in its various forms

A framework for interactive mindfulness meditation using attention-regulation process,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025914,78,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kavous-Salehzadeh-Niksirat/publication/316213157_A_Framework_for_Interactive_Mindfulness_Meditation_Using_Attention-Regulation_Process/links/5a024a46a6fdcc55a15b4baa/A-Framework-for-Interactive-Mindfulness-Meditation-Using-Attention-Regulation-Process.pdf,"
We are often overwhelmed by everyday stressors. Mindfulness meditation can help slow things down and bring one's attention into the present moment. Given the prevalence of smartphones, mindfulness-based mobile applications (MBMAs) have received much attention. Current MBMAs mainly use the guided meditation method which may not be always effective, e.g., users may not be able to follow the pace of instructions and they need a private environment. This paper presents a framework for interactive MBMAs which allows users to self-regulate their attention according to their abilities and conditions. The framework is described by an Attention-Regulation Process and has two components: (1) Relaxation Response and (2) Attention Restoration Theory. The framework is validated by our experiment. It also informs future development for interactive meditation and has broad implications for designing mindfulness and well-being.

Calibme: Fast and unsupervised eye tracker calibration for gaze-based pervasive human-computer interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025950,77,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2594.pdf,"
As devices around us become smart, our gaze is poised to become the next frontier of human-computer interaction (HCI). State-of-the-art mobile eye tracker systems typically rely on eye-model-based gaze estimation approaches, which do not require a calibration. However, such approaches require specialized hardware (e.g., multiple cameras and glint points), can be significantly affected by glasses, and, thus, are not fit for ubiquitous gaze-based HCI. In contrast, regression-based gaze estimations are straightforward approaches requiring solely one eye and one scene camera but necessitate a calibration. Therefore, a fast and accurate calibration is a key development to enable ubiquitous gaze-based HCI. In this paper, we introduce CalibMe, a novel method that exploits collection markers (automatically detected fiducial markers) to allow eye tracker users to gather a large array of calibration points, remove outliers, and automatically reserve evaluation points in a fast and unsupervised manner. The proposed approach is evaluated against a nine-point calibration method, which is typically used due to its relatively short calibration time and adequate accuracy. CalibMe reached a mean angular error of 0.59 (0=0.23) in contrast to 0.82 (0=0.15) for a nine-point calibration, attesting for the efficacy of the method. Moreover, users are able to calibrate the eye tracker anywhere and independently in - 10 s using a cellphone to display the collection marker.

Users have access to a growing ecosystem of devices (desktop, mobile and wearable) that can deliver notifications and help people to stay in contact. Smartwatches are gaining popularity, yet little is known about the user experience and their impact on our increasingly always online culture. We report on a qualitative study with existing users on their everyday use of smartwatches to understand both the added value and the challenges of being constantly connected at the wrist. Our findings show that users see a large benefit in receiving notifications on their wrist, especially in terms of helping manage expectations of availability. Moreover, we find that response rates after viewing a notification on a smartwatch change based on the other devices available: laptops prompt quicker replies than smartphones. Finally, there are still many costs associated with using smartwatches, thus we make a series of design recommendations to improve the user experience of smartwatches.

Smart home systems are becoming an integral feature of the emerging home IT market. Under this general term, products mainly address issues of security, energy savings and comfort. Comprehensive systems that cover several use cases are typically operated and managed via a unified dashboard. Unfortunately, research targeting user experience (UX) design for smart home interaction that spans several use cases or covering the entire system is scarce. Furthermore, existing comprehensive and user-centered longterm studies on challenges and needs throughout phases of information collection, installation and operation of smart home systems are technologically outdated. Our 18-month Living Lab study covering 14 households equipped with smart home technology provides insights on how to design for improving smart home appropriation. This includes a stronger sensibility for household practices during setup and configuration, flexible visualizations for evolving demands and an extension of smart home beyond the location.

Effects of sharing physiological states of players in a collaborative virtual reality gameplay,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026028,75,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p4045.pdf,"
Interfaces for collaborative tasks, such as multiplayer games can enable more effective and enjoyable collaboration. However, in these systems, the emotional states of the users are often not communicated properly due to their remoteness from one another. In this paper, we investigate the effects of showing emotional states of one collaborator to the other during an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) gameplay experience. We created two collaborative immersive VR games that display the real-time heart-rate of one player to the other. The two different games elicited different emotions, one joyous and the other scary. We tested the effects of visualizing heart-rate feedback in comparison with conditions where such a feedback was absent. The games had significant main effects on the overall emotional experience.

For online communities to be successful, they must retain an adequate number of members who contribute to the community. The amount and type of communication members receive can play an important role in generating and sustaining members' commitment to it. However, the communication that members find valuable may change with their tenure in the community. This paper examines how the communication members receive in an health support community influences their commitment and how this influence changes with their tenure in the community. Commitment was operationalized with three measures: self-reported attachment, continued participation in the community, and responding to others. Results show that receiving communication was generally associated with increased commitment across the three measures, with its impact increasing with members' tenure. However, the average amount of informational and emotional support members received per message was associated with decreased commitment. Results have implications for interventions to encourage members' commitment to their communities throughout their history in the community.

Despite a proliferation of research in the use of ICTs to support active and healthy ageing, few have considered the privacy and security concerns particular to the elderly. We investigated the appropriation of tablet devices and a neighborhood portal as well as emerging privacy and security issues through ethnographic and action research in a long-term participatory design (PD) project with elderly participants. We discuss two major themes: a) the tensions related to perceived digital threats and the social pressures of online disclosure to the social environment; and b) the relation of these issues to the ICT appropriation process and the referring challenges we encountered. We argue that there is a need to understand the interleaving of physical and virtual habitats, the various ways resulting in discomfort and the senior citizens' actions -- which at first glance appear contradictory. We consider the implications of the issues observed for examining privacy and security concerns more broadly as well as discussing implications for the design of the portal and the shaping of social measures for appropriation support.

Homebound students, those who can learn but have a serious health issue (e.g. cancer, heart disease, immune deficiency) that prevents physical attendance at school, are now able to go to school using telepresence robots. Telepresence robots are generally video conferencing units on remote-controlled robots. Previous research has shown that using these robots allows homebound students to interact with classmates and teachers as if they are physically present. But, what does this mean for teachers and administrators? We present a qualitative study of 22 teachers and school administrators who worked with telepresent students and 4 who decided against adopting the robot. Our goal was to learn how decisions are made to adopt the robot, what issues arise in its use, and what would make adoption easier. This study contributes new insights on teacher and administrator perspectives on what is needed for effective use of this technology in educational settings.

This paper explores the combination of multiple concurrent modalities for conveying emotional information in HCI: temperature, vibration and abstract visual displays. Each modality has been studied individually, but can only convey a limited range of emotions within two-dimensional valence-arousal space. This paper is the first to systematically combine multiple modalities to expand the available affective range. Three studies were conducted: Study 1 measured the emotionality of vibrotactile feedback by itself; Study 2 measured the perceived emotional content of three bimodal combinations: vibrotactile + thermal, vibrotactile + visual and visual + thermal. Study 3 then combined all three modalities. Results show that combining modalities increases the available range of emotional states, particularly in the problematic top-right and bottom-left quadrants of the dimensional model. We also provide a novel lookup resource for designers to identify stimuli to convey a range of emotions

Handsfree omnidirectional VR navigation using head tilt,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025521,75,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p4063.pdf,"
Navigating mobile virtual reality (VR) is a challenge due to limited input options and/or a requirement for handsfree interaction. Walking-in-place (WIP) is considered to offer a higher presence than controller input but only allows unidirectional navigation in the direction of the user's gaze--which impedes navigation efficiency. Leaning input enables omnidirectional navigation but currently relies on bulky controllers, which aren't feasible in mobile VR contexts. This note evaluates the use of head-tilt - implemented using inertial sensing - to allow for handsfree omnidirectional VR navigation on mobile VR platforms. A user study with 24 subjects compared three input methods using an obstacle avoidance navigation task: (1) head-tilt alone (TILT) (2) a hybrid method (WIP-TILT) that uses head tilting for direction and WIP to control speed; and (3) traditional controller input. TILT was significantly faster than WIP-TILT and joystick input, while WIP-TILT and TILT offered the highest presence. There was no difference in cybersickness between input methods.

Sharing online is an important way in which people across the lifespan express themselves, maintain relationships, and connect with others. Yet, people with dementia are often not supported in engaging to the full extent of their abilities, particularly in their interaction with online technology. This paper presents a design case study that examines what it means to design for agency in online sharing involving individuals with dementia. Our work is situated in the context of art therapy for adults with dementia. We present the design and exploration of Moments, a system that allows individuals to share through artwork by manipulating their physical environment. We discuss how designing for agency calls attention to the ways in which the material workspace, including the tools we introduce, and the surrounding social context participate in the creation of agency.

Participatory Design (PD) has become a standard methodology in HCI, however, the evaluation of the outcomes of participatory processes is often exclusively driven by researcher defined measures of success. Through our work with autistic children, who have radically different life worlds from our own, it became evident that their criteria for the success of a project are most likely also very different. In order to address the limitations of researcher defined and led evaluations in this context, we developed an approach for participatory evaluation called PEACE (Participatory Evaluation with Autistic ChildrEn). Using this approach, we were able to include autistic children in dedicated evaluation phases through the co-definition of goals and methods, joint processes of data gathering and the co-interpretation of results. We discuss three case studies in which we successfully applied our approach and conclude with a reflection on the novel insights created through participatory evaluation and researchers' roles in such a process.

In this driving simulator study, we examined the performance of participants (N=30) after an abrupt loss of automated vehicle control. We tested three transition time conditions, with an unstructured transition of control occurring 2s, 5s, or 8s before entering a curve. As participants were occupied with an active secondary task (playing a game on a tablet) while the automated driving mode was enabled, they needed to disengage from the task and regain control of the car when the transition occurred. Few drivers in the 2 second condition were able to safely negotiate the road hazard situation, while the majority of drivers in the 5 or 8 second conditions were able to navigate the hazard situation safely.

We present a qualitative inquiry through the lens of feminist Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) into women's perceptions of personal safety in New Delhi, India. Since a brutal gang-rape incident took place in Delhi in December 2012 and received global attention, women's safety has been the focus of much attention India-wide. In April 2016, the Indian government issued a mandate that all mobile phones sold in India 2017 onwards must include a panic button for women's safety. We draw on interview and survey data to examine women's responses to the mandate, also investigating what factors influence their perceptions of safety, positively and negatively. Our findings indicate that women's sense of safety may be deconstructed into a multitude of factors--personal, public, social, technological--that must align for this sense of safety to be preserved. We then discuss the implications these factors have for the success and (re-)design of the panic button and similar interventions.

Current virtual and augmented reality head-mounted displays usually include no or only a single vibration motor for haptic feedback and do not use it for guidance. We present HapticHead, a system utilizing multiple vibrotactile actuators distributed in three concentric ellipses around the head for intuitive haptic guidance through moving tactile cues. We conducted three experiments, which indicate that HapticHead vibrotactile feedback is both faster (2.6 s vs. 6.9 s) and more precise (96.4% vs. 54.2% success rate) than spatial audio (generic head-related transfer function) for finding visible virtual objects in 3D space around the user. The baseline of visual feedback is as expected more precise (99.7% success rate) and faster (1.3 s) in comparison, but there are many applications in which visual feedback is not desirable or available due to lighting conditions, visual overload, or visual impairments. Mean final precision with HapticHead feedback on invisible targets is 2.3° compared to 0.8° with visual feedback. We successfully navigated blindfolded users to real household items at different heights using HapticHead vibrotactile feedback independently of a head-mounted display.

This paper considers how parents use the social media platform Instagram to facilitate the capture, curation and sharing of 'family snapshots'. Our work draws upon established cross-disciplinary literature relating to film photography and the composition of family albums in order to establish whether social media has changed the way parents visually present their families. We conducted a qualitative visual analysis of a sample of 4,000 photographs collected from Instagram using hashtags relating to children and parenting. We show that the style and composition of snapshots featuring children remains fundamentally unchanged and continues to be dominated by rather bland and idealised images of the happy family and the cute child. In addition, we find that the frequent taking and sharing of photographs via Instagram has inevitably resulted in a more mundane visual catalogue of daily life. We note a tension in the desire to use social media as a means to evidence good parenting, while trying to effectively manage the social identity of the child and finally, we note the reluctance of parents to use their own snapshots to portray family tension or disharmony, but their willingness to use externally generated content for this purpose.

In this paper, we explore how users can control remote devices with a virtual long arm, while preserving the perception that the artificial arm is actually part of their own body. Instead of using pointing, speech, or a remote control, the users' arm is extended in augmented reality, allowing access to devices that are out of reach. Thus, we allow users to directly manipulate real-world objects from a distance using their bare hands. A core difficulty we focus on is how to maintain ownership for the unnaturally long virtual arm, which is the strong feeling that one's limbs are actually part of the own body. Fortunately, what the human brain experiences as being part of the own body is very malleable and we find that during interaction the user's virtual arm can be stretched to more than twice its real length, without breaking the user's sense of ownership for the virtual limb.

Consumers are turning to Facebook Groups to buy and sell with strangers in their local communities. This trend is counter-intuitive given Facebook's lack of conventional e-commerce features, such as sophisticated search engines and reputation systems. We interviewed 18 members of two Mom-to-Mom Facebook sale groups. Despite a lack of commerce tools, members perceived sale groups as an easy-to-use way to quickly and conveniently buy and sell. Most important to members was that the groups felt safe and trustworthy. Drawing on these insights, we contribute a novel framing, community commerce, which explains the trust mechanisms that enable transactions between strangers in some groups. Community commerce fosters trust through (a) exclusive membership to a closed group, (b) regulation and sanctioning of behavior at the admin, member, and group level, and (c) a shared group identity or perceived similarity (though, surprisingly, not through social bonding). We discuss how community commerce affords unique and sometimes superior trust assurances and propose design implications for platforms hoping to foster trust between members who buy, sell, or share amongst themselves.

This paper contributes a novel sensing approach to support on- and above-skin finger input for interaction on the move. WatchSense uses a depth sensor embedded in a wearable device to expand the input space to neighboring areas of skin and the space above it. Our approach addresses challenging camera-based tracking conditions, such as oblique viewing angles and occlusions. It can accurately detect fingertips, their locations, and whether they are touching the skin or hovering above it. It extends previous work that supported either mid-air or multitouch input by simultaneously supporting both. We demonstrate feasibility with a compact, wearable prototype attached to a user's forearm (simulating an integrated depth sensor). Our prototype---which runs in real-time on consumer mobile devices---enables a 3D input space on the back of the hand. We evaluated the accuracy and robustness of the approach in a user study. We also show how WatchSense increases the expressiveness of input by interweaving mid-air and multitouch for several interactive applications.

Successful collaboration relies on the coordination and alignment of communicative cues. In this paper, we present mechanisms of bidirectional gaze - the coordinated production and detection of gaze cues - by which a virtual character can coordinate its gaze cues with those of its human user. We implement these mechanisms in a hybrid stochastic/heuristic model synthesized from data collected in human-human interactions. In three lab studies wherein a virtual character instructs participants in a sandwich-making task, we demonstrate how bidirectional gaze can lead to positive outcomes in error rate, completion time, and the agent's ability to produce quick, effective nonverbal references. The first study involved an on-screen agent and the participant wearing eye-tracking glasses. The second study demonstrates that these positive outcomes can be achieved using head-pose estimation in place of full eye tracking. The third study demonstrates that these effects also transfer into virtual-reality interactions.

The rise of affordable head-mounted displays (HMDs) has raised questions about how to best design user interfaces for this technology. This paper focuses on the use of HMDs for home and office applications that require substantial text input. A physical keyboard is a familiar and effective text input device in normal desktop computing. But without additional camera technology, an HMD occludes all visual feedback about a user's hand position over the keyboard. We describe a system that assists HMD users in typing on a physical keyboard. Our system has a virtual keyboard assistant that provides visual feedback inside the HMD about a user's actions on the physical keyboard. It also provides powerful automatic correction of typing errors by extending a state-of-the-art touchscreen decoder. In a study with 24 participants, we found our virtual keyboard assistant enabled users to type more accurately on a visually-occluded keyboard. We found users wearing an HMD could type at over 40 words-per-minute while obtaining an error rate of less than 5%.

Squeezeback: Pneumatic compression for notifications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025526,71,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p5318.pdf,"
Current mobile devices commonly use vibration feedback to signal incoming notifications. However, vibration feedback exhibits strong attention capture, limiting its use to short periods and prominent notifications. Instead, we investigate the use of compression feedback for notifications, which scales from subtle stimuli to strong ones and can provide sustained stimuli over longer periods. Compression feedback utilizes inflatable straps around a user's limbs, a form factor allowing for easy integration into many common wearables. We explore technical aspects of compression feedback and investigate its psychophysical properties with several lab and in situ studies. Furthermore, we show how compression feedback enables reactive feedback. Here, deflation patterns are used to reveal further information on a user's query. We also compare compression and vibrotactile feedback and find that they have similar performance.

EarFieldSensing A Novel In-Ear Electric Field Sensing to Enrich Wearable Gesture Input through Facial Expressions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025692,68,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p1911.pdf,"
EarFieldSensing (EarFS) is a novel input method for mobile and wearable computing using facial expressions. Facial muscle movements induce both electric field changes and physical deformations, which are detectable with electrodes placed inside the ear canal. The chosen ear-plug form factor is rather unobtrusive and allows for facial gesture recognition while utilizing the close proximity to the face. We collected 25 facial-related gestures and used them to compare the performance levels of several electric sensing technologies (EMG, CS, EFS, EarFS) with varying electrode setups. Our developed wearable fine-tuned electric field sensing employs differential amplification to effectively cancel out environmental noise while still being sensitive towards small facial-movement-related electric field changes and artifacts from ear canal deformations. By comparing a mobile with a stationary scenario, we found that EarFS continues to perform better in a mobile scenario. Quantitative results show EarFS to be capable of detecting a set of 5 facial gestures with a precision of 90% while sitting and 85.2% while walking. We provide detailed instructions to enable replication of our low-cost sensing device. Applying it to different positions of our body will also allow to sense a variety of other gestures and activities.

The human body reveals emotional and bodily states through measurable signals, such as body language and electroencephalography. However, such manifestations are difficult to communicate to others remotely. We propose EmotionActuator, a proof-of-concept system to investigate the transmission of emotional states in which the recipient performs emotional gestures to understand and interpret the state of the sender.We call this kind of communication embodied emotional feedback, and present a prototype implementation. To realize our concept we chose four emotional states: amused, sad, angry, and neutral. We designed EmotionActuator through a series of studies to assess emotional classification via EEG, and create an EMS gesture set by comparing composed gestures from the literature to sign-language gestures. Through a final study with the end-to-end prototype interviews revealed that participants like implicit sharing of emotions and find the embodied output to be immersive, but want to have control over shared emotions and with whom. This work contributes a proof of concept system and set of design recommendations for designing embodied emotional feedback systems.

BioSync: A paired wearable device for blending kinesthetic experience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025829,68,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p3316.pdf,"
We present a novel, paired, wearable system for combining the kinesthetic experiences of two persons. These devices allow users to sense and combine muscle contraction and joint rigidity bi-directionally. This is achieved through kinesthetic channels based on electromyogram (EMG) measurement and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). We developed a pair of wearable kinesthetic input-output (I/O) devices called bioSync that uses specially designed electrodes to perform biosignal measurement and stimulation simultaneously on the same electrodes. In a user study, participants successfully evaluated the strength of their partners' muscle contractions while exerting their own muscles. We confirmed that the pair of devices could help participants synchronize their hand movements through tapping, without visual and auditory feedback. The proposed interpersonal kinesthetic communication system can be used to enhance interactions such as clinical gait rehabilitation and sports training, and facilitate sharing of physical experiences with Parkinson's patients, thereby enhancing understanding of the physical challenges they face in daily life.

Due to the high number and cost of interruptions at work, several approaches have been suggested to reduce this cost for knowledge workers. These approaches predominantly focus either on a manual and physical indicator, such as headphones or a closed office door, or on the automatic measure of a worker's interruptibilty in combination with a computer-based indicator. Little is known about the combination of a physical indicator with an automatic interruptibility measure and its long-term impact in the workplace. In our research, we developed the FlowLight, that combines a physical traffic-light like LED with an automatic interruptibility measure based on computer interaction data. In a large-scale and long-term field study with 449 participants from 12 countries, we found, amongst other results, that the FlowLight reduced the interruptions of participants by 46%, increased their awareness on the potential disruptiveness of interruptions and most participants never stopped using it.

The partnership between local residents and city officials to inform policy and decision-making about government resources, or participatory governance, has been extensively studied. In addition to numerous ethnographic studies about how citizens engage in-person, there has been increased focus in HCI to understand the impact of technology on citizen participation in local governance. Building upon those studies, this paper provides unique insight from a 3-year longitudinal study on the use of online tools that were organically adapted by citizens to engage in local governance in three diverse Chicago neighborhoods. Though the responsiveness of government officials varied across communities, our results suggest that citizens use technology to heighten the visibility of their concerns, to support mechanisms of government accountability, and to provide various options for resident participation in local governance. We argue that while communities may be effective in their use of ICTs, technology may not increase their political power.

Social media and user-generated content (UGC) are increasingly important features of journalistic work in a number of different ways. However, their use presents major challenges, not least because information posted on social media is not always reliable and therefore its veracity needs to be checked before it can be considered as fit for use in the reporting of news. We report on the results of a series of in-depth ethnographic studies of journalist work practices undertaken as part of the requirements gathering for a prototype of a social media verification 'dashboard' and its subsequent evaluation. We conclude with some reflections upon the broader implications of our findings for the design of tools to support journalistic work.

People with low vision have a visual impairment that affects their ability to perform daily activities. Unlike blind people, low vision people have functional vision and can potentially benefit from smart glasses that provide dynamic, always-available visual information. We sought to determine what low vision people could see on mainstream commercial augmented reality (AR) glasses, despite their visual limitations and the device's constraints. We conducted a study with 20 low vision participants and 18 sighted controls, asking them to identify virtual shapes and text in different sizes, colors, and thicknesses. We also evaluated their ability to see the virtual elements while walking. We found that low vision participants were able to identify basic shapes and read short phrases on the glasses while sitting and walking. Identifying virtual elements had a similar effect on low vision and sighted people's walking speed, slowing it down slightly. Our study yielded preliminary evidence that mainstream AR glasses can be powerful accessibility tools. We derive guidelines for presenting visual output for low vision people and discuss opportunities for accessibility applications on this platform.

Experience-Centred Design (ECD) has been applied in numerous HCI projects to call attention to the particular and dialogical nature of people's experiences with technology. In this paper, we report on ECD within the context of publicly-funded, long-stay residential dementia care, where the approach helped to highlight aspects of participants' felt experience, and informed sensitive and meaningful design responses. This study contributes an extended understanding of the quality of experience and the means of making sense in dementia, as well as unpicking the potential of ECD to support enriched experience and contextual meaning-making for people with dementia. Finally, we delineate what it is about Experience-Centred Design that differentiates the approach from other often-used approaches in designing in dementia contexts: 1) explorative thinking, 2) working within 'cuttings-out of time and space', 3) careful yet expressive methodology and documentation, and 4) working together to imagine futures. We end with considerations of how the contributions of this research may extend to other experience-centred projects in challenging settings.

Through their combination of lifestyle and method, Silicon Valley models for tech production such as design thinking, startup incubators, lean management, etc. are spreading across the globe. These paradigms are positioned by product designers, politicians, investors and corporations alike as replicable routes to individual and national empowerment. They are portrayed as universal templates, portable across national borders and applicable to local needs. We draw from our ethnographic engagements with tech entrepreneurial efforts in Ghana, China, and Jamaica to unpack the stakes involved in their uptake, showing that while local actors produce situated alternatives, their work nevertheless often results in a continued valorization of these seemingly universal methods. We argue that design methods shape not only use practices, but have consequences for the life worlds of professional designers. This includes how they impact personal and national identities, confer legitimacy in transnational innovation circles, and secure access to social and economic resources. Ultimately, we call for an inclusion of these factors in ongoing conversations about design and design methods.

How data workers cope with uncertainty: A task characterisation study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025738,69,https://hal.science/hal-01472865/file/unstudy_chi.pdf,"
Uncertainty plays an important and complex role in data analysis, where the goal is to find pertinent patterns, build robust models, and support decision making. While these endeavours are often associated with professional data scientists, many domain experts engage in such activities with varying skill levels. To understand how these domain experts (or ""data workers"") analyse uncertain data we conducted a qualitative user study with 12 participants from a variety of domains. In this paper, we describe their various coping strategies to understand, minmise, exploit or even ignore this uncertainty. The choice of the coping strategy is influenced by accepted domain practices, but appears to depend on the types and sources of uncertainty and whether participants have access to support tools. Based on these findings, we propose a new process model of how data workers analyse various types of uncertain data and conclude with design considerations for uncertainty-aware data analytics.

The behavior of the least-secure user can influence security and privacy outcomes for everyone else. Thus, it is important to understand the factors that influence the security and privacy of a broad variety of people. Prior work has suggested that users with differing socioeconomic status (SES) may behave differently; however, no research has examined how SES, advice sources, and resources relate to the security and privacy incidents users report. To address this question, we analyze a 3,000 respondent, census-representative telephone survey. We find that, contrary to prior assumptions, people with lower educational attainment report equal or fewer incidents as more educated people, and that users' experiences are significantly correlated with their advice sources, regardless of SES or resources.

By exploiting visual popout effects, interface designers can rapidly draw a user's attention to salient information objects in a display. A variety of different visual stimuli can be used to achieve popout effects, including color, shape, size, motion, luminance, and flashing. However, there is a lack of understanding about how accurately different intensities of these effects support popout, particularly as targets move further from the center of the visual field. We therefore conducted a study to examine the accuracy of popout target identification using different visual variables, each at five different levels of intensity, and at a wide range of angles from the display center. Results show that motion is a strong popout stimulus, even at low intensities and wide angles. Identification accuracy decreases rapidly across visual angle with other popout stimuli, particularly with shape and color. The findings have relevance to a wide variety of applications, particularly as multi-display desktop environments increase in size and visual extent.

Entering text is very challenging on smartwatches, especially on non-touch smartwatches where virtual keyboards are unavailable. In this paper, we designed and implemented COMPASS, a non-touch bezel-based text entry technique. COMPASS positions multiple cursors on a circular keyboard, with the location of each cursor dynamically optimized during typing to minimize rotational distance. To enter text, a user rotates the bezel to select keys with any nearby cursors. The design of COMPASS was justified by an iterative design process and user studies. Our evaluation showed that participants achieved a pick-up speed around 10 WPM and reached 12.5 WPM after 90-minute practice. COMPASS allows users to enter text on non-touch smartwatches, and also serves as an alternative for entering text on touch smartwatches when touch is unavailable (e.g., wearing gloves).

Common appliances have shifted toward flat interface panels, making them inaccessible to blind people. Although blind people can label appliances with Braille stickers, doing so generally requires sighted assistance to identify the original functions and apply the labels. We introduce Facade - a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline to help blind people independently make physical interfaces accessible by adding a 3D printed augmentation of tactile buttons overlaying the original panel. Facade users capture a photo of the appliance with a readily available fiducial marker (a dollar bill) for recovering size information. This image is sent to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Facade then generates a 3D model for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls. Finally, a home 3D printer or commercial service fabricates the layer, which is then aligned and attached to the interface by the blind person. We demonstrate the viability of Facade in a study with 11 blind participants.

Nearly 40 million workers in the USA, a third of the working population, are low-wage, meaning they make less than $11.65 per hour. These workers face the pervasive and detrimental challenge of wage violations, also known as wage theft, which is any illegal activity by an employer that denies benefits or wages to employees. We interviewed 24 low-wage workers who experienced wage theft and sought justice about their work practices, challenges, and information technology usage. Based on these interviews, we identify three key sociotechnical practices these workers engaged in to address their wage theft: 1) identifying wage and payment discrepancies; 2) tracking and documenting work; and 3) pursuing wage claims. Seeking to leverage HCI research to interrupt uneven social, economic, and information relations in the low-wage workplace, we ultimately reflect on the possibility and limits of several key design recommendations.

Instructors are increasingly using algorithmic tools for team formation, yet little is known about how these tools are applied or how students and instructors perceive their use. We studied a representative team formation tool (CATME) in eight project-based courses. An instructor uses the tool to form teams by surveying students' working styles, skills, and demographics; then configuring these criteria as input into an algorithm that assigns teams. We surveyed students (N=277) in the courses to gauge their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool and ideas for improving it. We also interviewed instructors (N=13) different from those who taught the eight courses to learn about their criteria selections and perceptions of the tool. Students valued the rational basis for forming teams but desired a stronger voice in criteria selection and explanations as to why they were assigned to a particular team. Instructors appreciated the efficiency of team formation but wanted to view exemplars of criteria used in similar courses. This work contributes recommendations for deploying team formation tools in educational settings and for better satisfying the goals of all stakeholders.

Our results reveal that unlike small-scale venues and situations, remote users take a more socially isolated and functional approach to remote attendance while combating challenges around scheduling and large navigational spaces.

We collaborated with the community in developing an air quality monitoring system which integrated heterogeneous data over a large spatial and temporal scale. The system afforded strong scientific evidence by using animated smoke images, air quality data, crowdsourced smell reports, and wind data. In our evaluation, we report patterns of sharing smoke images among stakeholders. Our survey study shows that the scientific knowledge provided by the system encourages agonistic discussions with regulators, empowers the community to support policy making, and rebalances the power relationship between stakeholders.

Results indicate marked variance in how people refer to the device, with over half using the personified name Alexa but most referencing the device with object pronouns. Degree of device personification is linked with sociability of interactions: greater personification co-occurs with more social interactions with the Echo.

The first phase of our study was centred upon a hackathon during which teams of designers were asked to conceptualise and prototype digital products or services for those affected by self-harm. We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.

Individuals with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) collaborate with spousal caregivers daily to pursue what is most important to their health and well-being. Previous research in human-computer interaction has supported individuals with chronic conditions or their caregivers, but little has supported both as a unit. We conducted a field study with 12 patient-caregiver dyads, all married and living together, to identify partners' values and how they shape collaborative management of MCC. Partners' coinciding values motivated them to empathize with and support each other in the face of challenges related to health and well-being. When their values were asymmetric, they perceived tensions between individual autonomy and their ability to coordinate with their partner. Systems to support partners in this context could help them overcome asymmetric values, but should balance this with support for individual autonomy.

While most rehabilitation technologies target situated exercise sessions and associated performance metrics, physiotherapists recommend physical activities that are integrated with everyday functioning. We conducted a 1-2 week home study to explore how people with chronic pain use wearable technology that senses and sonifies movement (i.e., movement mapped to sound in real-time) to do functional activity (e.g., loading the dishwasher). Our results show that real-time movement sonification led to an increased sense of control during challenging everyday tasks. Sonification calibrated to functional activity facilitated application of pain management techniques such as pacing. When calibrated to individual needs, sonification enabled serendipitous discovery of physical capabilities otherwise obscured by a focus on pain or a dysfunctional proprioceptive system. A physiotherapist was invited to comment on the implications of our findings. We conclude by discussing opportunities provided by wearable sensing technology to enable better functioning, the ultimate goal of physical rehabilitation.

The emergence of tools that support fast-and-easy visualization creation by non-experts has made the benefits of InfoVis widely accessible. Key features of these tools include attribute-level operations, automated mappings, and visualization templates. However, these features shield people from lower-level visualization design steps, such as the specific mapping of data points to visuals. In contrast, recent research promotes constructive visualization where individual data units and visuals are directly manipulated. We present a qualitative study comparing people's visualization processes using two visualization tools: one promoting a top-down approach to visualization construction (Tableau Desktop) and one implementing a bottom-up constructive visualization approach (iVoLVER). Our results show how the two approaches influence: 1) the visualization process, 2) decisions on the visualization design, 3) the feeling of control and authorship, and 4) the willingness to explore alternative designs. We discuss the complex trade-offs between the two approaches and outline considerations for designing better visualization tools.

Reappropriating hackathons: the production work of the CHI4Good day of service,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025637,63,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025637,"
The popularity of hackathons has increased as technology pervades more facets of our lives. Originally designed for programmers, hackathons are now being appropriated by new stakeholders across diverse sectors. Yet with this evolution in hackathons, we no longer adequately understand what is produced and, thereby, the value of these events. We conducted an interview study with 22 stakeholders - participants, representatives of nonprofit organizations, and organizers - of the CHI4Good Day of Service to understand what is produced through philanthropic hackathons. Whereas traditional hackathons are oriented around the production of code or prototypes, our analysis of interview data suggests that the production work of philanthropic hackathons also includes technical capacity and expertise, expanded social networks, an exposure to design process, affective experiences, and an opportunity for participants to shape their identities against a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary backdrop. We conclude by reflecting on implications for the CHI community in carrying out philanthropic events styled after hackathons.

Traditional qualitative research methods, such as, interviews and focus groups, may not be feasible for certain populations- who face time, mobility, and availability constraints. We adapted the Asynchronous, Remote, Community-based (ARC) method that used closed Facebook groups to study people with rare diseases, to study a different population - pregnant and new mothers. During the course of eight weeks, we engaged 48 participants in 19 study activities using three closed Facebook groups. We added new activities to the original ARC method, informed by past HCI research, to triangulate participant input. We carefully analyzed participation patterns and activity engagement, to assess the suitability of the ARC method for engaging pregnant and new mothers in remote, group-based, qualitative research. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ARC method, noting participation characteristics, activity preferences, and the suitability of the ARC method as an online focus group.

Our research aims to support community health workers (CHWs) in low-resource settings by providing them with personalized information regarding their work. This information is delivered through a combination of voice- and web-based feedback that is derived from data already collected by CHWs. We describe the in situ participatory design approach used to create usable and appropriate feedback for low-literate CHWs and present usage data from a 12-month study with 71 CHWs in India. We show how the system supported and motivated CHWs, and how they used both the web- and voice-based systems, and each of the visualizations, for different reasons. We also show that the comparative feedback provided by the system introduced elements of competition that discouraged some CHWs while motivating others. Taken together, our findings suggest that providing personalized voice- and web-based feedback could be an effective way to support and motivate CHWs in low-resource settings.

How busy are you? Predicting the interruptibility intensity of mobile users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025946,61,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025946,"
Smartphones frequently notify users about newly available messages or other notifications. It can be very disruptive when these notifications interrupt users while they are busy. Our work here is based on the observation that people usually exhibit different levels of busyness at different contexts. This means that classifying users' interruptibility as a binary status, interruptible or not interruptible, is not sufficient to accurately measure their availability towards smartphone interruptions. In this paper, we propose, implement and evaluate a two-stage hierarchical model to predict people's interruptibility intensity. Our work is the first to introduce personality traits into interruptibility prediction model, and we found that personality data improves the prediction significantly. Our model bootstraps the prediction with similar people's data, and provides a good initial prediction for users whose individual models have not been trained on their own data yet. Overall prediction accuracy of our model can reach 66.1%.

It is common for researchers to use self-report measures (e.g. surveys) to measure people's security behaviors. In the computer security community, we don't know what behaviors people understand well enough to self-report accurately, or how well those self-reports correlate with what people actually do. In a six week field study, we collected both behavior data and survey responses from 122 subjects. We found that a relatively small number of behaviors -- mostly related to tasks that require users to take a specific, regular action -- have non-zero correlations. Since security is almost never a user's primary task for everyday computer users, several important security behaviors that we directly measured were not self-reported accurately. These results suggest that security research based on self-report is only reliable for certain behaviors. Additionally, a number of important security behaviors are not sufficiently salient to users that they can self-report accurately.

Due to the prevalence of personal health tracking, cases of self-logged data being utilized in the clinic are gradually increasing. However, obstacles to clinicians' ability to further adopt such data-driven medical consultations in the existing workflow remain, such as lack of time and poor interoperability. In this paper, we conducted a workshop to design a clinician interface supporting the integration of data-driven consultation into the existing workflow and investigate the role of the interface in situ. After implementing the clinician interface designed based on the workshop results, we observed 32 cases of actual use within the clinical context. We found that our interface, DataMD, helped the clinician construct a new workflow, enhanced the clinician's counseling skills, and facilitated more in-depth conversation. This paper contributes to empirically identifying the role of a clinician interface through a user-centered design approach.

Changing moods: How manual tracking by family caregivers improves caring and family communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025843,59,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p158.pdf,"
Previous research on healthcare technologies has shown how health tracking promotes desired behavior changes and effective health management. However, little is known about how the family caregivers' use of tracking technologies impacts the patient-caregiver relationship in the home. In this paper, we explore how health-tracking technologies could be designed to support family caregivers cope better with a depressed family member. Based on an interview study, we designed a simple tracking tool called Family Mood and Care Tracker (FMCT) and deployed it for six weeks in the homes of 14 family caregivers who were caring for a depressed family member. FMCT is a tracking tool designed specifically for family caregivers to record their caregiving activities and patient's conditions. Our findings demonstrate how caregivers used it to better understand the illness and cope with depressed family members. We also show how our tool improves family communication, despite the initial concerns about patient-caregiver conflicts.

The emergence of mobile apps for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) allows learners to access quality learning materials at low cost and ""to control where, what, how and with whom they learn"". Unfortunately, when compared with traditional classroom education, learners face more distractions and are more likely to multitask when they study alone in an informal learning environment. In this paper, we investigate the impact of divided attention (DA) on both the learning process and learning outcomes in the context of mobile MOOC learning. We propose OneMind, a system and algorithm for detecting divided attention on unmodified mobile phones via implicit, camera-based heart rate tracking. In an 18-participant study, we found that internal divided attention has a significant negative impact on learning outcomes; and that the photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms implicitly captured by OneMind can be used to detect the presence, type, and intensity of divided attention in mobile MOOC learning.

In this paper we explore the use of activity-, physiological-, and indoor-location sensing to promote mobility during work-breaks. While the popularity of devices and applications to promote physical activity is growing, prior research highlights important constraints when designing for the workplace. With these constraints in mind, we developed BreakSense, a mobile application that uses a Bluetooth beacon infrastructure, a smartphone and a smartwatch to encourage mobility during breaks with a game-like design. We discuss constraints imposed by design for work and the workplace, and highlight challenges associated with the use of noisy sensors and methods to overcome them. We then describe a short deployment of BreakSense within our lab that examined bound vs. unbound augmented breaks and how they affect users' sense of completion and readiness to work.

TrussFab embodies the required engineering knowledge, allowing non-engineers to design such structures and to validate their design using integrated structural analysis. We have used TrussFab to design and fabricate tables and chairs, a 2.5 m long bridge strong enough to carry a human, a functional boat that seats two, and a 5 m diameter dome.

Much research has shown that social media platforms have substantial population biases. However, very little is known about how these population biases affect the many algorithms that rely on social media data. Focusing on the case study of geolocation inference algorithms and their performance across the urban-rural spectrum, we establish that these algorithms exhibit significantly worse performance for underrepresented populations (i.e. rural users). We further establish that this finding is robust across both text- and network-based algorithm designs. However, we also show that some of this bias can be attributed to the design of algorithms themselves rather than population biases in the underlying data sources. For instance, in some cases, algorithms perform badly for rural users even when we substantially overcorrect for population biases by training exclusively on rural data. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design and study of social media-based algorithms.

Studies on technology adoption typically assume that a user's perception of usability and usefulness of technology are central to its adoption. Specifically, in the case of accessibility and assistive technology, research has traditionally focused on the artifact rather than the individual, arguing that individual technologies fail or succeed based on their usability and fit for their users. Using a mixed-methods field study of smartphone adoption by 81 people with visual impairments in Bangalore, India, we argue that these positions are dated in the case of accessibility where a non-homogeneous population must adapt to technologies built for sighted people. We found that many users switch to smartphones despite their awareness of significant usability challenges with smartphones. We propose a nuanced understanding of perceived usefulness and actual usage based on need-related social and economic functions, which is an important step toward rethinking technology adoption for people with disabilities.

Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on the relationship between the platform and the community and offer suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in establishing their own maker communities.

Drones pose privacy concerns such as surveillance and stalking. Many technology-based or policy-based mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate these concerns. However, it is unclear how drone controllers and bystanders perceive these mechanisms and whether people intend to adopt them. In this paper, we report results from two rounds of online survey with 169 drone controllers and 717 bystanders in the U.S. We identified respondents' perceived pros and cons of eight privacy mechanisms. We found that owner registration and automatic face blurring individually received most support from both controllers and bystanders. Our respondents also suggested using varied combinations of mechanisms under different drone usage scenarios, highlighting their context-dependent preferences. We outline a set of important questions for future privacy designs and public policies of drones.

HCI research has demonstrated Mixed Reality (MR) as being beneficial for co-located collaborative work. For remote collaboration, however, the collaborators' visual contexts do not coincide due to their individual physical environments. The problem becomes apparent when collaborators refer to physical landmarks in their individual environments to guide each other's attention. In an experimental study with 16 dyads, we investigated how the provisioning of shared virtual landmarks (SVLs) influences communication behavior and user experience. A quantitative analysis revealed that participants used significantly less ambiguous spatial expressions and reported an improved user experience when SVLs were provided. Based on these findings and a qualitative video analysis we provide implications for the design of MRs to facilitate remote collaboration.

We consider kinesthetic awareness, the perception of our own body position and movement in space, as a critical value for embodied design within third wave HCI. We designed an interactive sound installation that supports kinesthetic awareness of a participant's micro-movements. The installation's interaction design uses continuous auditory feedback and leverages an adaptive mapping strategy, refining its sensitivity to increase sonic resolution at lower levels of movement activity. The installation uses field recordings as rich source materials to generate a sound environment that attunes to a participant's micro-movements. Through a qualitative study using a second-person interview technique, we gained nuanced insights into the participants' subjective experiences of the installation. These reveal consistent temporal patterns, as participants build on a gradual process of integration to increase the complexity and capacity of their kinesthetic awareness during interaction.

Observing trends and predicting future values are common tasks for viewers of bivariate data visualizations. As many charts do not explicitly include trend lines or related statistical summaries, viewers often visually estimate trends directly from a plot. How reliable are the inferences viewers draw when performing such regression by eye? Do particular visualization designs or data features bias trend perception? We present a series of crowdsourced experiments that assess the accuracy of trends estimated using regression by eye across a variety of bivariate visualizations, and examine potential sources of bias in these estimations. We find that viewers accurately estimate trends in many standard visualizations of bivariate data, but that both visual features (e.g., ""within-the-bar"" bias) and data features (e.g., the presence of outliers) can result in visual estimates that systematically diverge from standard least-squares regression models.

We present three design aspects of proxemic transitions: transition speed, stepwise reconfiguration, and radical shifts. The design aspects focus on how to balance between physical and digital transformations in designing for proxemic transitions. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) the notion of proxemic transitions, 2) three design aspects to consider in designing for proxemic transitions, and 3) initial exploration of how these design aspects might generate designs of dynamic furniture.

We formulated color, odor and shape changing material primitives which act as sensor-actuators that convert pH signals into human-readable outputs. Food-grade organic molecules anthocyanin, vanillin, and chitosan were employed as dopants to synthesize materials which output a spectrum of colors, degrees of shape deformation, and switch between odorous and non-odorous states. We evaluated the individual output properties of our sensor-actuators to assess the rate, range, and reversibility of the changes as a function of pH 2-10. We present a design space with techniques for enhancing the functionality of the material primitives, and offer passive and computational methods for controlling the material interfaces. Finally, we explore applications enabled by Organic Primitives under four contexts: environmental, cosmetic, edible, and interspecies.

Health and wellbeing applications increasingly raise ethical issues for design. User-centred and participatory design approaches, while grounded in everyday wisdom, cannot be expected to address ethical reflection consistently, as multiple value systems come into play. We explore the potential of phronesis, a concept from Aristotelian virtue ethics, for mHealth design. Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment garnered from practical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for self-reporting symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly affects value priorities in design; (c) ethical pluralism recognising different coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help designers foster the values that promote human flourishing.

Toward measurement of situation awareness in autonomous vehicles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025822,54,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas-Martelaro/publication/316652733_Toward_Measurement_of_Situation_Awareness_in_Autonomous_Vehicles/links/59f1ed4e0f7e9beabfcc52e1/Toward-Measurement-of-Situation-Awareness-in-Autonomous-Vehicles.pdf,"
Until vehicles are fully autonomous, safety, legal and ethical obligations require that drivers remain aware of the driving situation. Key decisions about whether a driver can take over when the vehicle is confused, or its capabilities are degraded, depend on understanding whether he or she is responsive and aware of external conditions. The leading techniques for measuring situation awareness in simulated environments are ill-suited to autonomous driving scenarios, and particularly to on-road testing. We have developed a technique, named Daze, to measure situation awareness through real-time, in-situ event alerts. The technique is ecologically valid: it resembles applications people use in actual driving. It is also flexible: it can be used in both simulator and on-road research settings. We performed simulator-based and on-road test deployments to (a) check that Daze could characterize drivers' awareness of their immediate environment and (b) understand practical aspects of the technique's use. Our contributions include the Daze technique, examples of collected data, and ways to analyze such data.

Real-time tracking of people's location, orientation and activities is increasingly important for designing novel ubiquitous computing applications. Top-view camera-based tracking avoids occlusion when tracking people while collaborating, but often requires complex tracking systems and advanced computer vision algorithms. To facilitate the prototyping of ubiquitous computing applications for interactive spaces, we developed EagleSense, a real-time human posture and activity recognition system with a single top-view depth-sensing camera. We contribute our novel algorithm and processing pipeline, including details for calculating silhouette-extremities features and applying gradient tree boosting classifiers for activity recognition optimized for top-view depth sensing. EagleSense provides easy access to the real-time tracking data and includes tools for facilitating the integration into custom applications. We report the results of a technical evaluation with 12 participants and demonstrate the capabilities of EagleSense with application case studies.

The integration of multi-sensory stimuli, e.g. haptic airflow, in virtual reality (VR) has become an important topic of VR research and proved to enhance the feeling of presence. VaiR focuses on an accurate and realistic airflow simulation that goes far beyond wind. While previous works on the topic of airflow in VR are restricted to wind, while focusing on the feeling of presence, there is to the best of our knowledge no work considering the conceptual background or on the various application areas. Our pneumatic prototype emits short and long term flows with a minimum delay and is able to animate wind sources in 3D space around the user's head. To get insights on how airflow can be used in VR and how such a device should be designed, we arranged focus groups and discussed the topic. Based on the gathered knowledge, we developed a prototype which proved to increase presence, as well as enjoyment and realism, while not disturbing the VR experience.

Interaction proxies for runtime repair and enhancement of mobile application accessibility,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025846,54,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025846,"
We introduce interaction proxies as a strategy for runtime repair and enhancement of the accessibility of mobile applications. Conceptually, interaction proxies are inserted between an application's original interface and the manifest interface that a person uses to perceive and manipulate the application. This strategy allows third-party developers and researchers to modify an interaction without an application's source code, without rooting the phone, without otherwise modifying an application, while retaining all capabilities of the system (e.g., Android's full implementation of the TalkBack screen reader). This paper introduces interaction proxies, defines a design space of interaction re-mappings, identifies necessary implementation abstractions, presents details of implementing those abstractions in Android, and demonstrates a set of Android implementations of interaction proxies from throughout our design space. We then present a set of interviews with blind and low-vision people interacting with our prototype interaction proxies, using these interviews to explore the seamlessness of interaction, the perceived usefulness and potential of interaction proxies, and visions of how such enhancements could gain broad usage. By allowing third-party developers and researchers to improve an interaction, interaction proxies offer a new approach to personalizing mobile application accessibility and a new approach to catalyzing development, deployment, and evaluation of mobile accessibility enhancements.

Software developers rely on support from a variety of resources---including other developers---but the coordination cost of finding another developer with relevant experience, explaining the context of the problem, composing a specific help request, and providing access to relevant code is prohibitively high for all but the largest of tasks. Existing technologies for synchronous communication (e.g. voice chat) have high scheduling costs, and asynchronous communication tools (e.g. forums) require developers to carefully describe their code context to yield useful responses. This paper introduces Codeon, a system that enables more effective task hand-off between end-user developers and remote helpers by allowing asynchronous responses to on-demand requests. With Codeon, developers can request help by speaking their requests aloud within the context of their IDE. Codeon automatically captures the relevant code context and allows remote helpers to respond with high-level descriptions, code annotations, code snippets, and natural language explanations. Developers can then immediately view and integrate these responses into their code. In this paper, we describe Codeon, the studies that guided its design, and our evaluation that its effectiveness as a support tool. In our evaluation, developers using Codeon completed nearly twice as many tasks as those who used state-of-the-art synchronous video and code sharing tools, by reducing the coordination costs of seeking assistance from other developers.

WAVES: A wearable asymmetric vibration excitation system for presenting three-dimensional translation and rotation cues,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025741,54,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p4972.pdf,"
WAVES, a Wearable Asymmetric Vibration Excitation System, is a novel wearable haptic device for presenting three dimensions of translation and rotation guidance cues. In contrast to traditional vibration feedback, which usually requires that users learn to interpret a binary cue, asymmetric vibrations have been shown to induce a pulling sensation in a desired direction. When attached to the fingers, a single voicecoil actuator presents a translation guidance cue and a pair of voicecoil actuators presents a rotation guidance cue. The directionality of mechanoreceptors in the skin led to our choice of the location and orientation of the actuators in order to elicit very strong sensations in certain directions. For example, users distinguished a ""left"" cue versus a ""right"" cue 94.5% of the time. When presented with one of six possible direction cues, users on average correctly identified the direction of translation cues 86.1% of the time and rotation cues 69.0% of the time.

Personal informatics practices are increasingly common, with a range of consumer technologies available to support, largely individual, interactions with data (e.g., performance measurement and activity/health monitoring). In this paper, we explore the concept of social sensemaking. In contrast to high-level statistics, we posit that social networking and reciprocal sharing of fine-grained self-tracker data can provide valuable context for individuals in making sense of their data. We present the design of an online platform called Citizense Makers (CM), which facilitates group sharing, annotating and discussion of self-tracker data. In a field trial of CM, we explore design issues around willingness to share data reciprocally; the importance of familiarity between individuals; and understandings of common activities in contextualising one's own data.

Anonymity, ephemerality, and hyper-locality are an uncommon set of features in the design of online communities. However, these features were key to Yik Yak's initial success and popularity. In an interview-based study, we found that these three features deeply affected the identity of the community as a whole, the patterns of use, and the ways users committed to this community. We conducted interviews with 18 Yik Yak users on an urban American university campus and found that these three focal design features contributed to casual commitment, transitory use, and emergent community identity. We describe situated anonymity, which is the result of anonymity, ephemerality, and hyper-locality coexisting as focal design features of an online community. This work extends our understanding of use and identity-versus-bond based commitment, which has implications for the design and study of other atypical online communities.

Malleable embodiment: changing sense of embodiment by spatial-temporal deformation of virtual human body,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025962,52,,"
We hypothesize that replacing the visual perception of one's body with a spatial-temporal deformed state would change sensations associated with the body. We developed a system that captures full-body movement and generates estimated past and future body movement by deformation. With a head mounted display, people could see their bodies as slightly deformed. We then investigated 1) how human movement is physically changed, and 2) how humans feel about the change in physical and emotional views of the body due to virtual body deformation. Our results show that spatial-temporal deformation of a virtual body actually changes the sense of body as well as physical movement. For instance, a body image generated at approximately 25-100 ms in the future induced a ""lighter weight"" sensation. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the design implication of computational control for the physical and emotional sense of body.

A three-week field deployment with seven families shows that Chorus augments family interactions through sharing contents of personal and familial significance, supports togetherness and in-depth discussion by combining resources from multiple devices, helps to broach sensitive topics into familial conversation, and encourages participation from all family members including children. We discuss implications of this research and reflect on design choices and opportunities that can further enhance the family mealtime experience.

We found that participants think of themselves as being in a separate ""Rare World"" from the ""normal"" people in their lives and that relationships with friends and family members are strained. On the other hand, online communities were described as valuable sources of many forms of support, but do not adequately compensate for the lack of tangible support in offline relationships. We propose an approach to facilitating tangible support that leverages existing research on social matching, towards facilitating support among people with different rare diseases to overcome geographic and symptomatic challenges of coordinating support between people with the same rare disease.

An important problem for HCI researchers is to estimate the parameter values of a cognitive model from behavioral data. This is a difficult problem, because of the substantial complexity and variety in human behavioral strategies. We report an investigation into a new approach using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to condition model parameters to data and prior knowledge. As the case study we examine menu interaction, where we have click time data only to infer a cognitive model that implements a search behaviour with parameters such as fixation duration and recall probability. Our results demonstrate that ABC (i) improves estimates of model parameter values, (ii) enables meaningful comparisons between model variants, and (iii) supports fitting models to individual users. ABC provides ample opportunities for theoretical HCI research by allowing principled inference of model parameter values and their uncertainty.

Investigating tilt-based gesture keyboard entry for single-handed text entry on large devices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025520,55,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/10718/CHI17_SWiM_6_pages_Camera_Ready_2_.pdf?sequence=1,"
The popularity of mobile devices with large screens is making single-handed interaction difficult. We propose and evaluate a novel design point around a tilt-based text entry technique which supports single handed usage. Our technique is based on the gesture keyboard (shape writing). However, instead of drawing gestures with a finger or stylus, users articulate a gesture by tilting the device. This can be especially useful when the user's other hand is otherwise encumbered or unavailable. We show that novice users achieve an entry rate of 15 words-per-minute (wpm) after minimal practice. A pilot longitudinal study reveals that a single participant achieved an entry rate of 32 wpm after approximate 90 minutes of practice. Our data indicate that tilt-based gesture keyboard entry enables walk-up use and provides a suitable text entry rate for occasional use and can act as a promising alternative to single-handed typing in certain situations.

Predicting how users learn new or changed interfaces is a long-standing objective in HCI research. This paper contributes to understanding of visual search and learning in text entry. With a goal of explaining variance in novices' typing performance that is attributable to visual search, a model was designed to predict how users learn to locate keys on a keyboard: initially relying on visual short-term memory but then transitioning to recall-based search. This allows predicting search times and visual search patterns for completely and partially new layouts. The model complements models of motor performance and learning in text entry by predicting change in visual search patterns over time. Practitioners can use it for estimating how long it takes to reach the desired level of performance with a given layout.

In this paper we present an investigation into how hand usage is affected by different mobile phone form factors. Our initial (qualitative) study explored how users interact with various mobile phone types (touchscreen, physical keyboard and stylus). The analysis of the videos revealed that each type of mobile phone affords specific handgrips and that the user shifts these grips and consequently the tilt and rotation of the phone depending on the context of interaction. In order to further investigate the tilt and rotation effects we conducted a controlled quantitative study in which we varied the size of the phone and the type of grips (Symmetric bimanual, Asymmetric bimanual with finger, Asymmetric bimanual with thumb and Single handed) to better understand how they affect the tilt and rotation during a dual pointing task. The results showed that the size of the phone does have a consequence and that the distance needed to reach action items affects the phones' tilt and rotation. Additionally, we found that the amount of tilt, rotation and reach required corresponded with the participant's grip preference. We finish the paper by discussing the design lessons for mobile UI and proposing design guidelines and applications for these insights.

Ubiquitous access is an increasingly common vision of computing, wherein users can interact with any computing device or service from anywhere, at any time. In the era of personal computing, users with visual impairments required special-purpose, assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interact with computers. This paper investigates whether technologies like screen readers have kept pace with, or have created a barrier to, the trend toward ubiquitous access, with a specific focus on desktop computing as this is still the primary way computers are used in education and employment. Towards that, the paper presents a user study with 21 visually-impaired participants, specifically involving the switching of screen readers within and across different computing platforms, and the use of screen readers in remote access scenarios. Among the findings, the study shows that, even for remote desktop access - an early forerunner of true ubiquitous access - screen readers are too limited, if not unusable. The study also identifies several accessibility needs, such as uniformity of navigational experience across devices, and recommends potential solutions. In summary, assistive technologies have not made the jump into the era of ubiquitous access, and multiple, inconsistent screen readers create new practical problems for users with visual impairments.

Creative professionals are creating Virtual Reality (VR) experiences today by capturing spherical videos, but video editing is still done primarily in traditional 2D desktop GUI applications such as Premiere. These interfaces provide limited capabilities for previewing content in a VR headset or for directly manipulating the spherical video in an intuitive way. As a result, editors must alternate between editing on the desktop and previewing in the headset, which is tedious and interrupts the creative process. We demonstrate an application that enables a user to directly edit spherical video while fully immersed in a VR headset. We first interviewed professional VR filmmakers to understand current practice and derived a suitable workflow for in-headset VR video editing. We then developed a prototype system implementing this new workflow. Our system is built upon a familiar timeline design, but is enhanced with custom widgets to enable intuitive editing of spherical video inside the headset. We conducted an expert review study and found that with our prototype, experts were able to edit videos entirely within the headset. Experts also found our interface and widgets useful, providing intuitive controls for their editing needs.

We consider a large dataset of real-world, on-road driving from a 100-car naturalistic study to explore the predictive power of driver glances and, specifically, to answer the following question: what can be predicted about the state of the driver and the state of the driving environment from a 6-second sequence of macro-glances? The context-based nature of such glances allows for application of supervised learning to the problem of vision-based gaze estimation, making it robust, accurate, and reliable in messy, real-world conditions. So, it's valuable to ask whether such macro-glances can be used to infer behavioral, environmental, and demographic variables? We analyze 27 binary classification problems based on these variables. The takeaway is that glance can be used as part of a multi-sensor real-time system to predict radio-tuning, fatigue state, failure to signal, talking, and several environment variables.

Gaze estimation has widespread applications. However, little work has explored gaze estimation on smartphones, even though they are fast becoming ubiquitous. This paper presents ScreenGlint, a novel approach which exploits the glint (reflection) of the screen on the user's cornea for gaze estimation, using only the image captured by the front-facing camera. We first conduct a user study on common postures during smartphone use. We then design an experiment to evaluate the accuracy of ScreenGlint under varying face-to-screen distances. An in-depth evaluation involving multiple users is conducted and the impact of head pose variations is investigated. ScreenGlint achieves an overall angular error of 2.44º without head pose variations, and 2.94º with head pose variations. Our technique compares favorably to state-of-the-art research works, indicating that the glint of the screen is an effective and practical cue to gaze estimation on the smartphone platform. We believe that this work can open up new possibilities for practical and ubiquitous gaze-aware applications.

The availability of commodity 3D extruder pen allows direct drawing of 3D wire sculptures for novice users, enabling many novel applications such as intuitive spatial intelligence development for school students. However, the lack of spatial and structural cues among individual pen strokes makes the 3D drawing process challenging, which often leads to highly distorted and even incomplete wire sculptures. We present a mixed reality system, called `WireDraw', to immersively guide the 3D drawing for easy wire sculpturing. The system design is based on novel 3D drawing principles and the subsequent optimization, making the stroke sequence of the wire model drawable and easy to draw. On-the-fly edits on unsatisfactory strokes are also allowed for creative design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by testing on a variety of wire models and a user study. The results show that the visual guidance provided by our system is extremely helpful for drawing high-quality wire sculptures.

We explore spectating on video game play as an interactional and participatory activity. Drawing on a corpus of video recordings capturing 'naturally occurring' Kinect gaming within home settings, we detail how the analytic 'work' of spectating is interactionally accomplished as a matter of collaborative action with players and engagement in the game. We examine: spectators supporting players with continuous 'scaffolding'; spectators critiquing player technique during and between moments of play; spectators recognising and complimenting competent player conduct; and spectators reflecting on prior play to build instructions for the player. From this we draw out a number of points that shift the conversation in HCI about 'the spectator' towards understanding and designing for spectating as an interactional activity; that is, sequentially ordered and temporally coordinated. We also discuss bodily conduct and the particular ways of 'seeing' involved in spectating, and conclude with remarks on conceptual and design implications for HCI.

Problems of marginalization and inclusion are central to HCI scholarship and impact in the world, but are badly named in the binary models of access that currently dominate the field. Building on prior work in ICTD and infrastructure studies, this paper explores the problem of inclusion through historical and ethnographic study of Aadhaar, India's biometrics-based national identification project. We illustrate tensions between Aadhaar users' ability to register, authenticate and successfully deploy their registered identity to participate in the Public Distribution System (PDS), a government scheme that provides subsidized food grains to the Indian poor. We argue that rather than an all-or-nothing state, inclusion in ICTD infrastructures is an ongoing and fragile process, achieved (unevenly) at the seams of multiple interconnected systems. Finally, we show that questions of (effective) inclusion are determined not just at margins of a system (who is in and who is out) but also through the artful and often challenging negotiation of the seams that run through and connect complex distributed infrastructures.

While user attitudes towards those devices have been reported to be prevalently negative [14], it is still unclear, to what extent this initial, negative user attitude might impede adoption. However, indepth understanding is crucial for reducing barriers early in order to gain access to potential benefits from the technology. With this paper we contribute to a better understanding of factors affecting data glasses adoption, as well as current trends and opinions. Our multiple-year case study (N=118) shows, against expectations, no significant change towards a more positive attitude between 2014 and 2016. We complement these findings with an expert survey (N=51) investigating prognoses, challenges and discussing the relevance of social acceptability. We elicit and contrast a controversial spectrum of expert opinions, and assess whether initial objections can be overwritten. Our analysis shows that while social acceptability is considered relevant for the time being, utility and usability are more valued for long-term adoption.

The heat is on: A temperature display for conveying affective feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025844,48,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p1756.pdf,"
Previous research has investigated whether temperature can augment a range of media including music, images and video. We describe the first experiment to investigate whether temperature can augment emotion conveyed by text messages. A challenge in prior work has been ensuring users can discern different thermal signals. We present an improved technique for thermal feedback that uses an array of three thermal stimulators. We demonstrate that the Thermal Array Display (TAD) increases users' ability to identify temperatures within a narrower range, compared to using a single thermal stimulator. While text messages dominate valence in the absence of context for temperature, the TAD consistently conveys arousal, and can enhance arousal of text messages, especially those that are emotionally neutral. We discuss potential applications of augmenting text with temperature.

Providing online crisis information: An analysis of official sources during the 2014 carlton complex wildfire,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025627,49,https://www.academia.edu/download/53183381/WildfirePaper_Final_Version_withRefEdits.pdf,"
Using the 2014 Carlton Complex Wildfire as a case study, we examine who contributes official information online during a crisis event, and the timeliness and relevance of the information provided. We identify and describe the communication behaviors of four types of official information sources (Event Based Resources, Local Responders, Local News Media, and Cooperating Agencies), and collect message data from each source's website, public Facebook page, and/or Twitter account. The data show that the Local News Media provided the highest quantity of relevant information and the timeliest information. Event Based Resources shared the highest percentage of relevant information, however, it was often unclear who managed these resources and the credibility of the information. Based on these findings, we offer suggestions for how providers of official crisis information might better manage their online communications and ways that the public can find more timely and relevant online crisis information from official sources.

Egoscanning: Quickly scanning first-person videos with egocentric elastic timelines,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025821,51,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p6536.pdf,"
This work presents EgoScanning, a novel video fast-forwarding interface that helps users to find important events from lengthy first-person videos recorded with wearable cameras continuously. This interface is featured by an elastic timeline that adaptively changes playback speeds and emphasizes egocentric cues specific to first-person videos, such as hand manipulations, moving, and conversations with people, based on computer-vision techniques. The interface also allows users to input which of such cues are relevant to events of their interests. Through our user study, we confirm that users can find events of interests quickly from first-person videos thanks to the following benefits of using the EgoScanning interface: 1) adaptive changes of playback speeds allow users to watch fast-forwarded videos more easily; 2) Emphasized parts of videos can act as candidates of events actually significant to users; 3) Users are able to select relevant egocentric cues depending on events of their interests.

Android and other mobile operating systems ask users for authorization before allowing apps to access sensitive resources such as contacts and location. We hypothesize that such authorization systems could be improved by becoming more integrated with the app's user interface. In this paper, we conduct two studies to test our hypothesis. First, we use apptracer{}, a dynamic analysis tool we developed, to measure to what extent user interactions and sensitive resource use are related in existing apps. Second, we conduct an online survey to examine how different interactions with the UI affect users' expectations about whether an app accesses sensitive resources. Our results suggest that user interactions such as button clicks can be interpreted as authorization, reducing the need for separate requests; but that accesses not directly tied to user interactions should be separately authorized, possibly when apps are first launched.

What do we really know about how habituation to warnings occurs over time? A longitudinal fMRI study of habituation and polymorphic warnings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025896,49,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025896,"
A major inhibitor of the effectiveness of security warnings is habituation: decreased response to a repeated warning. Although habituation develops over time, previous studies have examined habituation and possible solutions to its effects only within a single experimental session, providing an incomplete view of the problem. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal experiment that examines how habituation develops over the course of a five-day workweek and how polymorphic warnings decrease habituation. We measured habituation using two complementary methods simultaneously: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking. Our results show a dramatic drop in attention throughout the workweek despite partial recovery between workdays. We also found that the polymorphic warning design was substantially more resistant to habituation compared to conventional warnings, and it sustained this advantage throughout the five-day experiment. Our findings add credibility to prior studies by showing that the pattern of habituation holds across a workweek, and indicate that cross-sectional habituation studies are valid proxies for longitudinal studies. Our findings also show that eye tracking is a valid measure of the mental process of habituation to warnings.

TriTap: identifying finger touches on smartwatches,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025561,50,http://www.whereveriam.org/work/UNIST/Gil_CHI17.pdf,"
The small screens of smartwatches provide limited space for input tasks. Finger identification is a promising technique to address this problem by associating different functions with different fingers. However, current technologies for finger identification are unavailable or unsuitable for smartwatches. To address this problem, this paper observes that normal smartwatch use takes places with a relatively static pose between the two hands. In this situation, we argue that the touch and angle profiles generated by different fingers on a standard smartwatch touch screen will differ sufficiently to support reliable identification. The viability of this idea is explored in two studies that capture touches in natural and exaggerated poses during tapping and swiping tasks. Machine learning models report accuracies of up to 93% and 98% respectively, figures that are sufficient for many common interaction tasks. Furthermore, the exaggerated poses show modest costs (in terms of time/errors) compared to the natural touches. We conclude by presenting examples and discussing how interaction designs using finger identification can be adapted to the smartwatch form factor.

Speech transcription is an expensive service with high turnaround time for audio files containing languages spoken in developing countries and regional accents of well-represented languages. We present Respeak - a voice-based, crowd-powered system that capitalizes on the strengths of crowdsourcing and automatic speech recognition (instead of typing) to transcribe such audio files. We created Respeak and optimized its design through a series of cognitive experiments. We deployed it with 25 university students in India who completed 5464 micro-transcription tasks, transcribing 55 minutes of widely-varied audio content, and collectively earning USD 46 as mobile airtime. The Respeak engine aligned the transcript generated by five randomly selected users to transcribe Hindi and Indian English audio files with a word error rate (WER) of 8.6% and 15.2%, respectively. The cost of speech transcription was USD 0.83 per minute with a turnaround time of 39.8 hours, substantially less than industry standards. Using a mixed-methods analysis of cognitive experiments, system performance and qualitative interviews, we evaluate Respeak's design, user experience, strengths, and weaknesses. Our findings suggest that Respeak improves the quality of speech transcription while enhancing the earning potential of low-income populations in resource-constrained settings.

Iteratively, we co-designed a transport platform accessible via a website, a mobile app, and an iTV app. We further looked at the appropriation of the platform into the daily lives of 19 persons. Studying the appropriation highlighted different factors that facilitate the adoption of alternative transport options. The factors included reducing uncertainty, complementing transport information with context information (e.g. weather) and providing informational access based on the user's preferences as well as fitting in with the situational needs (activity related).

Our approach focuses on illuminated elements, which are seamlessly integrated into standard paper. For that, we introduce an extended design space for paper-integrated illuminations. As a major contribution, we present a systematic feedback repertoire for real-world applications including feedback components for innovative paper interaction tasks in five categories. Furthermore, we contribute a fully-functional research platform including a paper-controller, digital pen and illuminated, digitally controlled papers that demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques. Finally, we report on six interviews, where experts rated our approach as intuitive and very usable for various applications, in particular educational ones.

A sizable part of HCI research on cross-device interaction is driven by the vision of users conducting complex knowledge work seamlessly across multiple mobile devices. This is based on the Weiserian assumption that people will be inclined to distribute their work across multiple ``pads' if such are available. We observed that this is not the reality today, even when devices were in abundance. We present a study with 24 participants in 12 dyads completing a collaborative visualization task with up to six tablets. They could choose between three different visualization types to answer questions about economic data. Tasks were designed to afford simultaneous use of tablets, either with linked or independent views. We found that users typically utilized only one tablet per user. A quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a ``legacy bias' that introduced barriers for using more tablets and reduced the overall benefit of multi-device visualization.

This paper explores an HCI approach to designing markets, with a primary focus on peer-to peer exchange platforms. We draw on recent work in economics that has documented how markets function, how they can be evaluated, and what can be done to fix them when they fail. We introduce five key concepts from market design: thickness, congestion, stability, safety, and repugnance. These lend HCI an analytic vocabulary for understanding why markets may succeed or struggle. Building on prior empirical work, we apply these concepts to compare two well-known network hospitality platforms, Couchsurfing and Airbnb. As a second illustrative case, we use market design to shed light on the challenges experienced by smaller-scale peer-to-peer marketplaces for lending, renting, and selling physical goods. To conclude, we discuss how this kind of analysis can make conceptual, evaluative, and generative contributions to the study and design of exchange platforms and other socio-technical systems.

The development of literacy and reading proficiency is a building block of lifelong learning that must be supported both in the classroom and at home. While the promise of interactive learning technologies has widely been demonstrated, little is known about how an interactive robot might play a role in this development. We used eight design features based on recommendations from interest-development and human-robot-interaction literatures to design an in-home learning companion robot for children aged 11--12. The robot was used as a technology probe to explore families' (N=8) habits and views about reading, how a reading technology might be used, and how children perceived reading with the robot. Our results indicate reading with the learning companion to be a way to socially engage with reading, which may promote the development of reading interest and ability.

A video tutorial effectively conveys complex motions, but may be hard to follow precisely because of its restriction to a predetermined viewpoint. Augmented reality (AR) tutorials have been demonstrated to be more effective. We bring the advantages of both together by interactively retargeting conventional, two-dimensional videos into three-dimensional AR tutorials. Unlike previous work, we do not simply overlay video, but synthesize 3D-registered motion from the video. Since the information in the resulting AR tutorial is registered to 3D objects, the user can freely change the viewpoint without degrading the experience. This approach applies to many styles of video tutorials. In this work, we concentrate on a class of tutorials which alter the surface of an object.

We propose a novel method of spatial audio rendering using ultrasound. An ultrasonic phased array generates one or more focal points in air, and they act as point sources of audible sound when the ultrasound waves are modulated. Our sound-point loudspeaker has two major advantages over conventional ultrasound-based sound-beam (superdirectional) loudspeakers. The higher audience selectivity means that our sound-point loudspeaker can deliver sound to the ears of the target person, whereas a sound-beam loudspeaker delivers sound to not only the target person but also other persons standing in the same direction. The other advantage is lower exposure to ultrasound; while an audible sound beam travels along an ultrasonic beam in a soundbeam loudspeaker, audible sound can be heard along the direction perpendicular to the ultrasonic beam in our soundpoint loudspeaker. This paper reports the principles of our sound-point loudspeaker, prototype construction, evaluation, and applications.

Human movement has historically been approached as a functional component of interaction within human computer interaction. Yet movement is not only functional, it is also highly expressive. In our research, we explore how movement expertise as articulated in Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) can contribute to the design of computational models of movement's expressive qualities as defined in the framework of Laban Efforts. We include experts in LMA in our design process, in order to select a set of suitable multimodal sensors as well as to compute features that closely correlate to the definitions of Efforts in LMA. Evaluation of our model shows that multimodal data combining positional, dynamic and physiological information allows for a better characterization of Laban Efforts. We conclude with implications for design that illustrate how our methodology and our approach to multimodal capture and recognition of Effort qualities can be integrated to design interactive applications.

BitBarista reveals social, environmental, qualitative and economic aspects of coffee supply chains. It allows people to choose a source of future coffee beans, situating their choices within the pool of decisions previously made. In doing so, it attempts to engage them in the transactions that are required to produce coffee. Initial studies of BitBarista with 42 participants reveal challenges of designing for connected systems, particularly in terms of perceptions of data gathering and sharing, as well as assumptions generated by current models of consumption. A discussion is followed by a series of suggestions for increasing positive attitudes towards data use in interactive systems.

Personas are a widely used tool to keep real users in mind, while avoiding stereotypical thinking in the design process. Yet, creating personas can be challenging.

We describe a case study in which Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is used to develop five distinctive personas for the design of a digital coach for sustainable weight loss. We show how behavioral theories such as SDT can help to understand what genuinely drives and motivates users to sustainably change their behavior. In our study, we used SDT to prepare and analyze interviews with envisioned users of the coach and to create complex, yet engaging and highly realistic personas that make users' basic psychological needs explicit. The paper ends with a critical reflection on the use of behavioral theories to create personas, discussing both challenges and strengths.

We present the Augmented Studio, an augmented reality system that uses body tracking to project anatomical structures and annotations over moving bodies for physiotherapy education. Through a user and learner centered design approach, we established an understanding that through augmentation and annotation, augmented reality technology can enhance physiotherapy education. Augmented Studio enables augmentation through projection mapping to display anatomical information such as muscles and skeleton in real time on the body as it moves. We created a technique for annotation to create projected hand-drawing on the moving body, to enable explicit communication of the teacher's clinical reasoning strategies to the students. Findings from our pilot usability study demonstrate a more engaging learning and teaching experience and increased communication between teacher and students when using Augmented Studio.

Capturing and describing the multi-faceted experiences autistic children have with technologies provides a unique research challenge. Approaches based on pragmatist notions of experience, which mostly rely on empathy, are particularly limited if used alone. To address this we have developed an approach that combines Actor-Network Theory and Critical Discourse Analysis. Drawing on this approach, we discuss the experiences autistic children had with technologies resulting from the collaborative design process in the OutsideTheBox project. We construct a holistic picture of the experience by drawing on diverse data sources ranging from interviews to log-data, and most importantly, the first-hand perspective of autistic children. In four case studies, we demonstrate how this approach allowed us to develop unique individual and structural insights into the experiences of autistic children with technology.

The financial crisis and austerity politics in Europe has had a devastating impact on public services, social security and vulnerable populations. Greek civil society responded quickly by establishing solidarity structures aimed at helping vulnerable citizens to meet their basic needs and empower them to co-create an anti-austerity movement. While digital technology and social media played an important role in the initiation of the movement, it has a negligible role in the movement's on-going practices. Through embedded work with several solidarity structures in Greece, we have begun to understand the ""solidarity economy"" (SE) as an experiment in direct democracy and self-organization. Working with a range of solidarity structures we are developing a vision for a ""Solidarity HCI"" committed to designing to support personal, social and institutional transformation through processes of agonistic pluralism and contestation, where the aims and objectives of the SE are continuously re-formulated and put into practice.

Visual question answering systems empower users to ask any question about any image and receive a valid answer. However, existing systems do not yet account for the fact that a visual question can lead to a single answer or multiple different answers. While a crowd often agrees, disagreements do arise for many reasons including that visual questions are ambiguous, subjective, or difficult. We propose a model, CrowdVerge, for automatically predicting from a visual question whether a crowd would agree on one answer. We then propose how to exploit these predictions in a novel application to efficiently collect all valid answers to visual questions. Specifically, we solicit fewer human responses when answer agreement is expected and more human responses otherwise. Experiments on 121,811 visual questions asked by sighted and blind people show that, compared to existing crowdsourcing systems, our system captures the same answer diversity with typically 14-23% less crowd involvement.

This paper presents the concept of technology individuation and explores its role in design. Individuation expresses how, over time, a technology becomes personal and intimate, unique in purpose, orchestrated in place, and how people eventually come to rely on it to sustain connection with others. We articulate this concept as a critical vantage point for designing augmented everyday objects and the Internet of Things. Individuation foregrounds aspects of habituation, routines and arrangements that through everyday practices reveal unique meaning, reflect self-identity and support agency. The concept is illustrated through three long term case studies of technology in use, involving tangible and embodied interaction with devices that afford communication, monitoring, and awareness in the home setting. The cases are analysed using Hornecker and Buur's Tangible Interaction Framework. We further extend upon this framework to better reveal the role played by personal values, history of use, and arrangements, as they develop over time in the home setting, in shaping tangible and embodied interaction with individuated technologies.

This paper presents the first tool addressing this challenge, the Facebook Data Valuation Tool (FDVT). The FDVT provides Facebook users with a personalized and real-time estimation of the revenue they generate for Facebook. Relying on the FDVT, we are able to shed light into several relevant HCI research questions that require a data valuation tool in place. The obtained results reveal that (i) there exists a deep lack of awareness among Internet users regarding the monetary value of personal information, (ii) data valuation tools such as the FDVT are useful means to reduce such knowledge gap, (iii) 1/3 of the users testing the FDVT show a substantial engagement with the tool.

In this paper we report a cognitive model of how people make decisions through interaction. The model is based on the assumption that interaction for decision making is an example of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) in which observations are made by limited perceptual systems that model human foveated vision and decisions are made by strategies that are adapted to the task. We illustrate the model by applying it to the task of determining whether to block a credit card given a number of variables including the location of a transaction, its amount, and the customer history. Each of these variables have a different validity and users may weight them accordingly. The model solves the POMDP by learning patterns of eye movements (strategies) adapted to different presentations of the data. We compare the model behavior to human performance on the credit card transaction task.

Our PeerFinder prototype enables users to find records that are similar to a seed record, using both record attributes and temporal events found in the records. A user study with 18 participants and four experts shows that users are more engaged and more confident about the value of the results to provide useful evidence to guide life choices when provided with more control over the search process and more context for the results, even at the cost of added complexity.

Participatory media: Creating spaces for storytelling in neighbourhood planning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025745,45,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025745,"
Neighbourhood planning devolves power to communities to create their own planning policy but traditional forms of participation are still relied upon. And despite the ubiquitous nature of technology in society, digital participation methods are rarely used. In this paper, we outline fieldwork with two neighbourhood planning groups who used participatory media technology to improve engagement though the art of storytelling. We focus on the configuration of participatory media as a way to widen participation and enable story creation and sharing amongst citizens. We highlight that storytelling using media technology can provide a model of and a model for the way we ""do"" neighbourhood planning whilst emphasising the challenges of ensuring processes are linked to tangible actions and encouraging the multiplicity of stories.

360° videos are made using omnidirectional cameras that capture a sphere around the camera. Viewers get an immersive experience by freely changing their field of view around the sphere. The problem is that current interfaces are designed for a single user, and we do not know what challenges groups of people will have when viewing these videos together. We report on the findings of a study where 16 pairs of participants watched 360° videos together in a ""guided tour"" scenario. Our findings indicate that while participants enjoyed the ability to view the scene independently, this caused challenges establishing joint references, leading to breakdowns in conversation. We conclude by discussing how gaze awareness widgets and gesturing mechanisms may support smoother collaborative interaction around collaborative viewing of 360° videos.

Frozen suit: designing a changeable stiffness suit and its application to haptic games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025655,47,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2440.pdf,"
We present the concept of Frozen Suit, a type of clothing that restricts users' movements at joint positions (e.g. elbow, knee) via a changeable stiffness jamming material. The suit can ""freeze"" users' body parts, for example during a game in order to provide the physical sensation of being frozen by an enemy. In this paper we first present the Frozen Suit concept and its potential applications. We then systematically investigate how to design jamming patches in order to sufficiently restrict an arm or a leg. In particular we used low-fidelity prototypes to explore the restricting power of different material and particles. In order to push this analysis further we conducted a controlled experiment in order to compare the perceived stiffness of different patches sizes attached to the elbow. We performed a paired comparison experience and used a Bradley-Terry-Luce model to analyze the subjective feedback from participants. We found that 20cm long x 7cm large is the most restrictive patch and that an increase in patch area correlates with an increase in perceived stiffness (quadratic). We finish by presenting a use case application with a game that we implemented where enemies can freeze the player.

360-degree filming and head-mounted displays (HMDs) give recorded media a new sense of space. Theatre practitioners' expertise in manipulating spatial interactions has much to contribute to immersive recorded content. Four theatre directors led teams of three actors to stage the same scene for both immersive theatre and for 360-degree filming. Each team was recorded performing the scene at least six times, three in each condition, to extract actors' coordinates. This study establishes how to quantify theatre practitioners' use of spatial interactions and examines the spatial adaptations made when transferring these relationships to 360-degree filming. Staging for a 360-degree camera compared to staging for an audience member had shorter distances from the camera and between performers, along with fewer instances of the camera being in the middle of the action. Across all groups, interpersonal distance between characters and between the audience/camera dropped at the end of the scene when the characters come together as a team, suggesting that elements of Proxemics may be applicable to narrative performance.

In this paper we report on a pervasive practice in video-mediated communication: where participants show one another one or more objects. This is a distinct activity from others considered by researchers of video-mediated technologies that focus on a face-to-face orientation, or just on the support necessary to help people to refer to objects. We first present examples of this pervasive phenomenon in naturally occurring Skype conversations, revealing how this conduct is configured and organized within the interaction between participants. We reveal how the subtle adjustment of the position of the body, the head and gaze with respect to the handheld objects offers crucial resources for participants to achieve joint seeing. Then we report on a quite different setting, a naturalistic experiment where participants collaborate on a collective task with remote colleagues through maneuverable, orientable devices (Kubis). Again, in these experiments participants frequently show objects, and at times the devices provide additional resources to support these activities. But at other times they also involve some difficulties. We conclude by suggesting possible technological developments, some quite simple, others more radical, that might support participants to show objects, whether they are in domestic settings or undertaking work activities.

To meet the demand for authentic, timely, and affordable feedback, researchers have explored technologies to connect designers with feedback providers online. While researchers have implemented mechanisms to improve the content of feedback, most systems for online feedback exchange do not support an end-to-end cycle, from help-seeking to sense-making to action. Building on extant literature in learning sciences, design, organizational behavior, and online communities, we propose a conceptual framework to highlight critical processes that affect online feedback exchange. We contribute research questions for future feedback systems and argue that online feedback systems must be able to support designers through five activities that happen before, during, and after the feedback exchange. Our framework suggests that systems should address broader socio-psychological factors, such as how intent should be communicated online, how dialogue can support the interpretation of feedback, and how to balance the tradeoffs of anonymizing feedback providers.

Toward usable evidence: optimizing knowledge accumulation in HCI research on health behavior change,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026013,46,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6161824/,"
Over the last ten years, HCI researchers have introduced a range of novel ways to support health behavior change, from glanceable displays to sophisticated game dynamics. Yet, this research has not had as much impact as its originality warrants. A key reason for this is that common forms of evaluation used in HCI make it difficult to effectively accumulate-and use-knowledge across research projects. This paper proposes a strategy for HCI research on behavior change that retains the field's focus on novel technical contributions while enabling accumulation of evidence that can increase impact of individual research projects both in HCI and the broader behavior-change science. The core of this strategy is an emphasis on the discovery of causal effects of individual components of behavior-change technologies and the precise ways in which those effects vary with individual differences, design choices, and contexts in which those technologies are used.

Tangibles may be effective for reading applications. Letters can be represented as 3D physical objects. Words are spatially organized collections of letters. We explore how tangibility impacts reading and spelling acquisition for young Anglophone children who have dyslexia. We describe our theory-based design rationale and present a mixed-methods case study of eight children using our PhonoBlocks system. All children made significant gains in reading and spelling on trained and untrained (new) words, and could apply all spelling rules a month later. We discuss the design features of our system that contributed to effective learning processes, resulting in successful learning outcomes: dynamic colour cues embedded in 3D letters, which can draw attention to how letter(s) position changes their sounds; and the form of 3D tangible letters, which can enforce correct letter orientation and enable epistemic strategies in letter organization that simplify spelling tasks. We conclude with design guidelines for tangible reading systems.

Understanding electrical circuits can be difficult for novices of all ages. In this paper, we describe a science museum exhibit that enables visitors to make circuits on an interactive tabletop and observe a simulation of electrons flowing through the circuit. Our goal is to use multiple representations to help convey basic concepts of current and resistance. To study visitor interaction and learning, we tested the design at a popular science museum with 60 parent-child dyads in three conditions: a control condition with no electron simulation; a condition with the simulation displayed alongside the circuit on the same screen; and an augmented reality condition, with the simulation displayed on a tablet that acts as a lens to see into the circuit. Our findings show that children did significantly better on a post-test in both experimental conditions, with children performing best in the AR condition. However, analysis of session videos shows unexpected parent-child collaboration in the AR condition.

Internet of Things (IoT) frequently involves conflicting interactions between devices and features that must be resolved to a single system state. The problem of feature interaction (FI) resolution has been investigated in Software Engineering through approaches that focus on verifiability but usually do not include the user in the evaluation. This paper bridges the gap between IoT approaches in HCI and Software Engineering by applying qualitative methods to understanding users' mental models of one representative FI resolution mechanism. Our contributions are in identifying common mental model errors and biases and how these may inform future IoT systems and research.

We propose the concept of ""Situational When"", an approach to understanding time in interface design not as a point on a calendar or clock, but as a set of converging circumstances that constitute ""the time"" for happenings to take place. Time is encoded both explicitly and implicitly in designed products. However, many technologies propagate business-centric, modernist values such as scheduling and efficiency, and marginalize broader socio-cultural aspects on which many activities are nonetheless contingent, e.g. the right people, the right weather conditions, and the right vibe. We derive our reflections from a case study of a cross-cultural digital noticeboard designed with an Australian Aboriginal community. Attention to the situational when opens up new possibilities for design that put greater emphasis on the social and relational aspects of time, the situational insights embodied in local narratives, and the tangible (e.g. people) and intangible (e.g. energy) circumstances that together make up the ""right"" time.

Multi-touch wall-sized displays afford collaborative exploration of large datasets and re-organization of digital content. However, standard touch interactions, such as dragging to move content, do not scale well to large surfaces and were not designed to support collaboration, such as passing an object around. This paper introduces CoReach, a set of collaborative gestures that combine input from multiple users in order to manipulate content, facilitate data exchange and support communication. We conducted an observational study to inform the design of CoReach, and a controlled study showing that it reduced physical fatigue and facilitated collaboration when compared with traditional multi-touch gestures. A final study assessed the value of also allowing input through a handheld tablet to manipulate content from a distance.

Drawing on 168 hours of video recordings of smartwatch use, this paper studies how context influences smartwatch use. We explore the effects of the presence of others, activity, location and time of day on 1,009 instances of use. Watch interaction is significantly shorter when in conversation than when alone. Activity also influences watch use with significantly longer use while eating than when socialising or performing domestic tasks. One surprising finding is that length of use is similar at home and work. We note that usage peaks around lunchtime, with an average of 5.3 watch uses per hour throughout a day. We supplement these findings with qualitative analysis of the videos, focusing on how use is modified by the presence of others, and the lack of impact of watch glances on conversation. Watch use is clearly a context-sensitive activity and in discussion we explore how smartwatches could be designed taking this into consideration.

Video chat is a popular form of computer-mediated communication in a range of contexts from online job interviews to chatting with friends. Although seeing your own video feedback is the predominant interface design, self-awareness research suggests that seeing oneself could induce self-consciousness and affect interaction. We created a custom video chat application and asked pairs of strangers to engage in an online personal information exchange task with or without video feedback. Feedback increased self-awareness and the use of socially-focused words, and decreased the use of words expressing certainty. In addition, mixed-gender dyads rated themselves as more socially orientated with feedback than without, which was reflected in an increased use of inclusive pronouns and affiliation words, and fewer words expressing discrepancy. However, with feedback, same-gender dyads reported greater task orientation than mixed-gender dyads reflected in increased use of task-relevant words. We discuss design implications in contexts from remote therapy to online dating.

We studied space use in an office building following a method we have designed to reveal the occupancy rate and navigational patterns. Our method involves two key components: 1) a pervasive sensing system that is scalable for large buildings, and high number of occupants, and 2) participatory data analysis engaging stakeholders including interior architects and building performance engineers, to refine the questions and define the needs for further analyses through multiple iterations. In this paper, we describe our method in detail, and exemplify how HCI methods and approaches can contribute to professional building design projects.

We present MarkPad, a novel interaction technique taking advantage of the touchpad. MarkPad allows creating a large number of size-dependent gestural shortcuts that can be spatially organized as desired by the user. It relies on the idea of using visual or tactile marks on the touchpad or a combination of them. Gestures start from a mark on the border and end on another mark anywhere. MarkPad does not conflict with standard interactions and provides a novice mode that acts as a rehearsal of the expert mode. A first study showed that an accuracy of 95% could be achieved for a dense configuration of tactile and/or visual marks allowing many gestures. Performance was 5% lower in a second study where the marks were only on the borders. A last study showed that borders are rarely used, even when the users are unaware of the technique. Finally, we present a working prototype and briefly report on how it was used by two users for a few months.

Using the Internet-enhanced self-disclosure hypothesis (ISDH) as a framework, we conducted an online survey of 274 Grindr users. Serial mediation analysis showed support for the ISDH, suggesting that Grindr use was negatively associated with loneliness.

Several recent studies have highlighted the need to support parallel usage of multiple devices for cross-device use.

Based on the results of a recent study in which users manually customized web pages for cross-device use, our first study elicits from users how they might want to trigger popular cross-device patterns to transform single-device designs with relatively little effort. Our second study then examines how the emerging design patterns could be applied to the Alexa top 50 sites from 10 different genres. Based on these studies, we design semi-automatic techniques for page segmentation and distribution between multiple devices that can work on many existing web sites and require only minimal user input to switch between different cross-device designs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to the Chrome web browser to make the techniques available for a wide range of desktop, mobile, and wearable devices, and successfully test them on popular web sites.

Catastrophic incidents associated with GPS devices and other personal navigation technologies are sufficiently common that these incidents have been given a colloquial nickname: ""Death by GPS"". While there is a significant body of work on the use of personal navigation technologies in everyday scenarios, no research has examined these technologies' roles in catastrophic incidents. In this paper, we seek to address this gap in the literature. Borrowing techniques from public health research and communication studies, we construct a corpus of 158 detailed news reports of unique catastrophic incidents associated with personal navigation technologies. We then identify key themes in these incidents and the roles that navigation technologies played in them, e.g. missing road characteristics data contributed to over 25% of these incidents. With the goal of reducing casualties associated with personal navigation technologies, we outline implications for design and research that emerge from our results, e.g. advancing ""space usage rule"" mapping, incorporating weather information in routing, and improving visual and audio instructions in complex situations.

Supporting expressive procedural art creation through direct manipulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025927,40,,"
Computation is a powerful artistic medium. Artists with experience in programming have demonstrated the unique creative opportunities of using code to make art. Currently, manual artists interested in using procedural techniques must undergo the difficult process of learning to program, and must adopt tools and practices far removed from those to which they are accustomed. We hypothesize that, through the right direct manipulation interface, we can enable accessible and expressive procedural art creation. To explore this, we developed Para, a digital illustration tool that supports the creation of declarative constraints in vector artwork. Para's constraints enable procedural relationships while facilitating live manual control and non-linear editing. Constraints can be combined with duplication behaviors and ordered collections of artwork to produce complex, dynamic compositions. We use the results of two open-ended studies with professional artists and designers to provide guidelines for accessible tools that integrate manual and procedural expression.

Using a mixed-methods evaluation, we demonstrate that this software leaves students with significantly increased knowledge about HIV and reduced stigma toward individuals infected with the virus. Validating the effectiveness of TeachAIDS in circumventing taboos, students report comfort in learning from the software, and it has since been deployed in tens of thousands of schools throughout India. The methodology presented here has broader implications for the design and implementation of interactive technologies for providing education on sensitive topics in health and other areas.

To lower the barriers to entry into software development, we created a prototype IDE for novices called CodePilot, which is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to integrate coding, testing, bug reporting, and version control management into a real-time collaborative system. CodePilot enables multiple users to connect to a web-based programming session and work together on several major phases of software development. An eight-subject exploratory user study found that first-time users of CodePilot spontaneously used it to assume roles such as developer/tester and developer/assistant when creating a web application together in pairs. Users felt that CodePilot could aid in scaffolding for novices, situational awareness, and lowering barriers to impromptu collaboration.

Yet, few systems help people reflect more fundamentally on the factors that influence behaviors such as physical activity (PA). To address this research gap, we take a novel approach, examining how such reflections can be stimulated through a medium that generations of families have used for reflection and teaching: storytelling. Through observations and interviews, we studied how 13 families interacted with a low-fidelity prototype, and their attitudes towards this tool. Our prototype used storytelling and interactive prompts to scaffold reflection on factors that impact children's PA. We contribute to HCI research by characterizing how families interacted with a story-driven reflection tool, and how such a tool can encourage critical processes for behavior change. Informed by the Transtheoretical Model, we present design implications for reflective informatics systems.

A good reason to die: how avatar death and high challenges enable positive experiences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026047,40,http://www.mmi-basel.ch/extras/2017_Petralito.pdf,"
Appropriate challenges and challenge-skill balance are usually key to positive player experiences. However, some games such as the successful series Dark Souls are notorious for their excessive difficulty. Yet, there has been little empirical investigation of why players enjoy games they constantly struggle and fail with. We surveyed 95 participants right after the release of Dark Souls III about their experiences with the game, employing both open questions and different player experience measures. Players generally enjoyed challenging play sessions and mostly reported positive experiences, with achievement and learning moments strongly contributing to positive experiences. However, these factors themselves were enabled by negative events such as difficulties and avatar death. Our findings showcase that negative events bear a potential for forming positive and meaningful experiences, thus expanding previous knowledge about the role of challenge and failing in games. Moreover, the significance of hard-earned achievements extends present design conventions.

Critique style guide: Improving crowdsourced design feedback with a natural language model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025883,41,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025883,"
Designers are increasingly leveraging online crowds; yet, online contributors may lack the expertise, context, and sensitivity to provide effective critique. Rubrics help feedback providers but require domain experts to write them and may not generalize across design domains. This paper introduces and tests a novel semi-automated method to support feedback providers by analyzing feedback language. In our first study, 52 students from two design courses created design solutions and received feedback from 176 online providers. Instructors, students, and crowd contributors rated the helpfulness of each feedback response. From this data, an algorithm extracted a set of natural language features (e.g., specificity, sentiment etc.) that correlated with the ratings. The features accurately predicted the ratings and remained stable across different raters and design solutions. Based on these features, we produced a critique style guide with feedback examples - automatically selected for each feature - to help providers revise their feedback through self-assessment. In a second study, we tested the validity of the guide through a between-subjects experiment (n=50). Providers wrote feedback on design solutions with or without the guide. Providers generated feedback with higher perceived helpfulness when using our style-based guidance.

Leisure activities are a source of meaning and enjoyment for individuals across the lifespan. In this study, we conducted interviews with twenty-four older adults living in four different independent living communities. We present societal and ecological factors and motivations that influenced the way people participated in and decided what constitutes leisure activities. The goal of maintaining physical and cognitive health was often intertwined with motivations to engage in leisure activities. We discuss how this fits into the broader framework of successful aging and implications for technology design. We also provide an example of how findings from this study can be applied to a specific leisure activity: watching television.

Digital fabrication machines (such as laser cutters or 3D printers) can be instructed to produce any part geometry within their application space. However, machines' application spaces are not easily modified or extended. How can we enable the production of application-specific computer-controlled machines by machine building novices? How can we facilitate rapid prototyping of rapid prototyping tools? We propose a novel set of modules, the Cardboard Machine Kit, for the construction of digital fabrication machines. These open-source modules are implemented using cardboard frames, stepper motors, and networked electronics controlled through a Python library. We evaluated the kit both through machine building workshops and by studying the usage of the kit in the wild. In the wild we observed more than 500 novice machine builders who built 125 different machines for 15 different application types. We argue that this breadth demonstrates the efficacy of this modular approach. Finally we discuss the limitations of the Cardboard Machine Kit and discuss how it could inform future machine building infrastructure.

Float: one-handed and touch-free target selection on smartwatches,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026027,44,,"
Touch interaction on smartwatches suffers from the awkwardness of having to use two hands and the ""fat finger"" problem. We present Float, a wrist-to-finger input approach that enables one-handed and touch-free target selection on smartwatches with high efficiency and precision using only commercially-available built-in sensors. With Float, a user tilts the wrist to point and performs an in-air finger tap to click. To realize Float, we first explore the appropriate motion space for wrist tilt and determine the clicking action (finger tap) through a user-elicitation study. We combine the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal with accelerometer and gyroscope to detect finger taps with a recall of 97.9% and a false discovery rate of 0.4%. Experiments show that using just one hand, Float allows users to acquire targets with size ranging from 2mm to 10mm in less than 2s to 1s, meanwhile achieve much higher accuracy than direct touch in both stationary (>98.9%) and walking (>71.5%) contexts.

A myoelectric prosthesis (myo) is a dexterous artificial limb controlled by muscle contractions. Learning to use a myo can be challenging, so extensive training is often required to use a myo prosthesis effectively. Signal visualizations and simple muscle-controlled games are currently used to help patients train their muscles, but are boring and frustrating. Furthermore, current training systems require expensive medical equipment and clinician oversight, restricting training to infrequent clinical visits. To address these limitations, we developed a new game that promotes fun and success, and shows the viability of a low-cost myoelectric input device. We adapted a user-centered design (UCD) process to receive feedback from patients, clinicians, and family members as we iteratively addressed challenges to improve our game. Through this work, we introduce a free and open myo training game, provide new information about the design of myo training games, and reflect on an adapted UCD process for the practical iterative development of therapeutic games.

Research on the viability of using crowdsourcing for HCI performance experiments has concluded that online results are similar to those achieved in the lab---at least for desktop interactions. However, mobile devices, the most popular form of online access today, may be more problematic due to variability in the user's posture and in movement of the device. To assess this possibility, we conducted two experiments with 30 lab-based and 303 crowdsourced participants using basic mouse and touchscreen tasks. Our findings show that: (1) separately analyzing the crowd and lab data yields different study conclusions-touchscreen input was significantly less error prone than mouse input in the lab but more error prone online; (2) age-matched crowdsourced participants were significantly faster and less accurate than their lab-based counterparts, contrasting past work; (3) variability in mobile device movement and orientation increased as experimenter control decreased--a potential factor affecting the touchscreen error differences. This study cautions against assuming that crowdsourced data for performance experiments will directly reflect lab-based data, particularly for mobile devices.

In this paper, we present ethnographic data that unpacks the everyday work of some of the many infrastructuring agents who contribute to creating, sustaining and growing the Blockchain information infrastructure. We argue that this infrastructuring work takes the form of entrepreneurial actions, which are self-initiated and primarily directed at sustaining or increasing the initiator's stake in the emerging information infrastructure. These entrepreneurial actions wrestle against the affordances of the installed base of the Blockchain infrastructure, and take the shape of engaging or circumventing activities. These activities purposefully aim at either influencing or working around the enablers and constraints afforded by the Blockchain information infrastructure, as its installed base is gaining inertia. This study contributes to our understanding of the purpose of infrastructuring, seen from the perspective of heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents. It supplements existing accounts of the ""when"" and ""how"" of infrastructure, with a lens for examining the ""why"" of infrastructure.

We bring in WIMP interfaces to TouchPivot, leveraging their familiarity and accessibility to novices. We report on a user study conducted to compare TouchPivot with two commercial interfaces, Tableau and Microsoft Excel's PivotTable. Our results show that novices not only answered data-driven questions faster, but also created a larger number of meaningful charts during freeform exploration with TouchPivot than others. Finally, we discuss the main hurdles novices encountered during our study and possible remedies for them.

During this process, we developed ProCom, a prototype system for measuring proximity without requiring instrumentation of the environment or another person. We used a variety of low and high fidelity prototypes, culminating in ProCom, to assess the feasibility, utility, and challenges of this approach. The results of these iterative design engagements indicate that wearable assistive technologies can support people in developing awareness of physical proximity in social settings.

The development of platforms for community decision-making has been of growing interest to the HCI community, yet the ways technology might be woven into traditional consultation processes has been under-studied. We conducted fieldwork at consultation events where residents were invited to discuss and map assets related to their neighbourhoods to inform community decision-making. The fieldwork highlighted problems with equality, turn taking, the evidencing and elaborating on opinions by residents, and challenges related to capturing and documenting the events. We developed Community Conversational-a hybrid table-top game and digital capture and review platform-in response to these issues. Community Conversational was designed to provide a flexible structure to consultation events related to 'place', and support the production, capture and review of deliberative 'talk' to support decision-making. We study how the platform was used in two consultation events, and discuss the implications of capturing and evidencing local people's opinions for the accountability of decision-makers and community organisations.

Small, local groups who share protected resources (e.g., families, work teams, student organizations) have unmet authentication needs. For these groups, existing authentication strategies either create unnecessary social divisions (e.g., biometrics), do not identify individuals (e.g., shared passwords), do not equitably distribute security responsibility (e.g., individual passwords), or make it difficult to share or revoke access (e.g., physical keys). To explore an alternative, we designed Thumprint: inclusive group authentication with a shared secret knock. All group members share one secret knock, but individual expressions of the secret are discernible. We evaluated the usability and security of our concept through two user studies with 30 participants. Our results suggest that (1) individuals who enter the same shared thumprint are distinguishable from one another, (2) that people can enter thumprints consistently over time, and (3) that thumprints are resilient to casual adversaries.

Recent HCI research has linked social policy to design, e.g., in issues such as public safety, privacy, and social justice. One area where policy, technology, and design intersect is in the vision of the creative economy. In that vision, creativity, distinct local/regional cultural practices, technology, and entrepreneurship synergistically produce social innovation on a scale sufficient to drive economies. Culture and creative industries (CCI) policy specifies how governments intervene to support such clusters. Maker cultures are seen as central to this vision, but comparatively little is known about how makers produce culture. We offer a critical analysis of several encounters between CCI policy in Taiwan and its maker scene. These encounters reveal misalignments that undercut efforts intended to support making. We propose that supporting any creative culture, including making, entails a serious commitment to understanding its culture, including its cultural contents and their means of production. We further argue that scholarly rigor in cultivating cultural appreciation is just as fundamental as scholarly rigor in empirically representing cultural practices when it comes to pursuing such a cultural understanding.

Low levels of engagement while driving can pose road safety risks, e.g., inattention during low traffic or routine trips. Interactive technologies that increase task engagement could therefore offer safety benefits, e.g., through performance feedback, increased challenge, and incentives. As a means to build upon these notions, we chose to explore gamification of the driving task. The research aim was to study how to design gamified applications that make safe driving more engaging. We present six design lenses which bring into focus considerations most relevant to creating engaging car applications. A user study enhanced our understanding of design requirements and revealed user personas to support the development of such applications. These lenses and personas informed two prototypes, which we evaluated in driving simulator studies. Our results indicate that the gamified conditions increased driver engagement and reduced driving speeds. As such, our work contributes towards the design of engaging applications that are both appropriate to the safety-critical driving context and compelling to users.

Since Dourish's critique of 'implications for design' [15], researchers have asked how design and ethnography should or could relate in HCI. Here we reflect on two experiences with cross-informing ongoing ethnographic investigation with the early stages of research through design. One uses speculative design to reflect on and inform ethnographic fieldwork on busyness in middle-class familes; the other uses speculative design to complement late-stage analysis of a historical ethnography of rural technological infrastructure. Rather than trying to do away with the gap between ethnography and design by seamlessly integrating the two processes, we reworked the relationship between ethnography and design by closing the gap in the temporal workflows while simultaneously maintaining a distinction in the performance of the two roles. We found that this new gap resulted in a series of misunderstandings; but by putting the two roles in active dialogue, we were able leverage misunderstandings into mutual benefit.

Although research has demonstrated improved outcomes for outpatients who receive peer support-such as through online health communities, support groups, and mentoring systems-hospitalized patients have few mechanisms to receive such valuable support. To explore the opportunities for a hospital-based peer support system, we administered a survey to 146 pediatric patients and caregivers, and conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve patients and three caregivers in a children's hospital. Our analysis revealed that hospitalized individuals need peer support for five key purposes: (1) to ask about medical details-such as procedures, treatments, and medications; (2) to learn about healthcare providers; (3) to report and prevent medical errors; (4) to exchange emotional support; and (5) to manage their time in the hospital. In this paper, we examine these themes and describe potential barriers to using a hospital-based peer support system.

Prevention of errors has been an orienting goal within the field of Human-Computer Interaction since its inception, with particular focus on minimizing human errors through appropriate technology design. However, there has been relatively little exploration into how designers can best support users of technologies that will inevitably make errors. We present a mixed-methods study in the domain of navigation technology for visually impaired individuals. We examined how users respond to device errors made in realistic scenarios of use. Contrary to conventional wisdom that usable systems must be error-free, we found that 42% of errors were acceptable to users. Acceptance of errors depends on error type, building feature, and environmental context. Further, even when a technical error is acceptable to the user, the misguided social responses of others nearby can negatively impact user experience. We conclude with design recommendations that embrace errors while also supporting user management of errors in technical systems.

In validation experiments, we show that GazeEverywhere's throughput according to ISO 9241-9 was improved over dwell time based interaction methods and nearly reached trackpad level. Online recalibration reduced interaction target ('button') size by about 25%.

Spatial memory is a powerful way for users to become expert with an interface, because remembering item locations means that users do not have to carry out slow visual search. Spatial learning in the real world benefits greatly from landmarks in the environment, but user interfaces often provide very few visual landmarks. In this paper we explore the use of artificial landmarks as a way to improve people's spatial memory in spatially-stable grid menus called CommandMaps. We carried out three studies to test the effects of three types of artificial landmarks (standard grid, simple anchor marks, and a transparent image) on spatial learning. We found that for small grid menus, the artificial landmarks had little impact on performance, whereas for medium and large grids, the simple anchor marks significantly improved performance. The simple visual anchors were faster and less error-prone than the visually richer transparent image. Our studies show that artificial landmarks can be a valuable addition to spatial interfaces.

There has been an increased interest in broader contexts from ecology and economics within the HCI community in recent years. These developments suggest that the HCI community should engage with and respond to concerns that are external to computing yet profoundly impact human society. In this paper we observe that taking these broader contexts into account yields a fundamentally different way to think about sustainable interaction design, one in which the designer's focus must be on a) ecological limits, b) creating designs and artifacts that do not further a cornucopian paradigm, and c) fundamental human needs. It can be hard to be responsive to these contexts in practical HCI work. To address this, we propose that the design rubric of disintermediation can serve as a unifying approach for work that aims to meet the ecological and economic challenges outlined in the literature. After discussing the potential use and impact of disintermedation, we perform an analysis using this design rubric to several key application areas.

The sensitizing concepts qualify interaction designers in considering proxemic consequences of technology design; they serve both as analytic lenses and as generative instruments in a design process.

However, the relation between the printed structure and the parameters causing the printing error is unclear. In this paper, we focus on the height position of the extruder and the amount of extruded material, and explore the combination of these parameters to enhance the capability of FDM. By extending an equation that calculates the amount of material from the layer height, we investigate the behavior and structure of material extruded from various height positions. On the basis of experimental results, the printed structure is classified into six categories according to the structural feature. We describe these structural features and demonstrate examples with new inherent expressions for FDM.

Gains from participatory design team membership as perceived by child alumni and their parents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025622,40,https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mlm/docs/2017-McNally-CHI-GainsFromParticipatoryDesign-Paper.pdf,"
The direct gains children perceive from their membership on Participatory Design (PD) teams are seldom the focus of research studies. Yet, how HCI practitioners choose to include children in PD methods may influence the value participants see in their participation, and thereafter the outcomes of PD processes. To understand what gains former child members of a PD team perceive from their participation we conducted a two-part study. In Study 1 we surveyed and interviewed child alumni of a PD team to determine gains that are perceived first-hand. In Study 2 we obtained a secondary perspective by surveying and interviewing parents of alumni. We report on the perceived gains to former participants that were identified and described in these two studies-including collaboration, communication, design process knowledge, and confidence. We reflect on our findings through discussions of the continued applicability of gains, new opportunities, and implications for PD practitioners and methods.

TDome: a touch-enabled 6DOF interactive device for multi-display environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025661,40,https://hal.science/hal-01740024/document,"
The rapid evolution of multi-display environments (MDEs) has created a vacuum in need of novel input devices to optimize interaction in MDEs. In this paper, we propose TDome, a novel touch-enabled 6DOF input and output device to facilitate interactions in MDEs. TDome offers a private display as output, and multiple degrees of freedom as input by combining touch gestures on the display with physical rotation, roll and translation manipulations of the device. TDome allows versatile interactions that address major MDE tasks, which we illustrate through various proof-of-concept implementations: detect surrounding displays, select one display, transfer data across displays, reach distant displays and perform private interactions. We explore TDome's usability and suitability for MDEs through three user studies. First we explore combined physical+touch gestures from which we discard uncomfortable combinations. We experimentally validate their feasibility and come up with a set of 71 combined gestures that are comfortable and ensure a high success rate, i.e. that can be easily performed and efficiently detected. Finally, we collect user feedback to identify natural mappings between gestures and MDE interactions.

Challenges in public display deployments: A taxonomy of external factors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025798,37,https://www.medien.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/pubdb/publications/pub/maekelae2017chi/maekelae2017chi.pdf,"
Public display deployments are often subjected to various surprising and unwanted effects. These effects are frequently due to external factors properties and phenomena that are unrelated to the deployment. Therefore, we conducted a literature review within the public display domain to investigate the causes behind the reported issues. This work presents a taxonomy of external factors affecting deployments, consisting of six categories: weather, events, surroundings, space, inhabitants, and vandalism. Apart from a few positive examples, we predominantly found negative effects arising from these factors. We then identified four ways of addressing the effects: ignoring, adapting, solving, and embracing. Of these, ignoring and adapting are substantially more frequent responses than solving and embracing emphasizing the need for researchers to adapt. We present real-world examples and insights on how researchers and practitioners can address the effects to better manage their deployments.

Manifesting the cyborg through techno-body modification: From human-computer interaction to integration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025629,36,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2499.pdf,"
A community of DIY cyborgs has emerged, known as 'grinders', who practice techno-body modification-the embedding of computing technology into the body. This paper reports on an ethnographic study following GrinderTech, an organization working to design, build and sell these technological artifacts, as it shifts from hacker collective to biotech startup. As technologies are embedded in the body, the boundary between human and machine starts to blur. We find that GrinderTech members, through the design and making of technologies for embedding, do so as a means to move beyond social and gendered binary constructions-or, societal norms that are practiced and performed, and re-enforced through language, as a way of creating power differentials in society, e.g. citizen/scientist and man/woman. Moreover, their motivations for designing and making these devices reflects their desire to re-imagine society. Finally, we re-conceptualize Human-Computer Interaction to include Integration-when technology is embedded in the human body-and discuss the theoretical and design implications of human-computer integration.

Pineal: Bringing passive objects to life with embedded mobile devices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025652,41,https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/research/publications-assets/pdf/pineal-bringing-passive-objects.pdf,"
Interactive, smart objects-customized to individuals and uses-are central to many movements, such as tangibles, the internet of things (IoT), and ubiquitous computing. Yet, rapid prototyping both the form and function of these custom objects can be problematic, particularly for those with limited electronics or programming experience. Designers often need to embed custom circuitry; program its workings; and create a form factor that not only reflects the desired user experience but can also house the required circuitry and electronics. To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects' ""smarts"". Furthermore, a series of prototypes show how Pineal exploits mobile sensing and output, and automatically generates 3D printed form-factors for rich, interactive, objects.

Comparing touchscreen and mouse input performance by people with and without upper body motor impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025603,37,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025603,"
Controlled studies of touchscreen input performance for users with upper body motor impairments remain relatively sparse. To address this gap, we present a controlled lab study of mouse vs. touchscreen performance with 32 participants (16 with upper body motor impairments and 16 without). Our study examines: (1) how touch input compares to an indirect pointing device (a mouse); (2) how performance compares across a range of standard interaction techniques; and (3) how these answers differ for users with and without motor impairments. While the touchscreen was faster than the mouse overall, only participants without motor impairments benefited from a lower error rate on the touchscreen. Indeed, participants with motor impairments had a three-fold increase in pointing (tapping) errors on the touchscreen compared to the mouse. Our findings also highlight the high frequency of spurious touches for users with motor impairments and update past accessibility recommendations for minimum touchscreen target sizes to at least 18mm.

How do system administrators resolve access-denied issues in the real world?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025999,37,,"
The efficacy of access control largely depends on how system administrators (sysadmins) resolve access-denied issues. A correct resolution should only permit the expected access, while maintaining the protection against illegal access. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that correct resolutions are occasional---sysadmins often grant too much access (known as security misconfigurations) to allow the denied access, posing severe security risks. This paper presents a quantitative study on real-world practices of resolving access-denied issues, with a particular focus on how and why security misconfigurations are introduced during problem solving. We characterize the real-world security misconfigurations introduced in the field, and show that many of these misconfigurations were the results of trial-and-error practices commonly adopted by sysadmins to work around access denials. We argue that the lack of adequate feedback information is one fundamental reason that prevents sysadmins from developing precise understanding and thus induces trial and error. Our study on access-denied messages shows that many of today's software systems miss the opportunities for providing adequate feedback information, imposing unnecessary obstacles to correct resolutions.

Heat-nav: Using temperature changes as navigation cues,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025965,38,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p1131.pdf,"
HCI is increasingly exploring how temperature can be used as an interaction modality. One challenge is that temperature changes are perceived over the course of seconds. This can be attributed to both the slow response time of skin thermoreceptors and the latency of the technology used to heat and cool the skin. For this reason, thermal cues are typically used to communicate single states, such as an emotion, and then there is a pause of tens of seconds to allow the skin to re-adapt to a neutral temperature before sending another signal. In contrast, this paper presents the first experimental demonstration that continuous temperature changes can guide behaviour: significantly improving performance in a 2D maze navigation task, without having to return to a neutral state before a new signal is sent. We discuss how continuous thermal feedback may be used for real world navigational tasks.

Evaluation of prototypes and the problem of possible futures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025658,35,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025658,"
There is a blind spot in HCI's evaluation methodology: we rarely consider the implications of the fact that a prototype can never be fully evaluated in a study. A prototype under study exists firmly in the present world, in the circumstances created in the study, but its real context of use is a partially unknown future state of affairs. This present-future gap is implicit in any evaluation of prototypes, be they usability tests, controlled experiments, or field trials. A carelessly designed evaluation may inadvertently evaluate the wrong futures, contexts, or user groups, thereby leading to false conclusions and expensive design failures. The essay analyses evaluation methodology from this perspective, illuminating how to mitigate the present-future gap.

Crowdfunding enables groups to self-fund the changes they want to make in the world. In other words, digital financial platforms are proving capable of supporting new relations between groups of people as well as offering new ways to organize money. Taking an HCI lens, we look at how some crowdfunding platform owners are approaching social innovation, not only at the level of supporting individual community initiatives, but at the broader level of using their platform to change societal behavior. Through four case studies, we show how crowdfunding has been chosen as a tool to redesign society by promoting environmental or social sustainability. We argue that the groups constituted through these interactions are not merely ""crowds"", but deliberate constellations built round a thing of interest (or ""paying publics""). Our interviews with managers and owners explore how interactions with and around platforms work to achieve these ends and we conclude with design considerations.

Augmented Reality (AR) is coming of age and appearing in various smartphone apps. One emerging AR type uses the front-facing camera and overlays a user's face with digital features that transform the physical appearance, making the user look like someone else, such as a popstar or a historical character. However, little is known about how people react to such stepping into character and how convincing they perceive it to be. We developed an app with two Egyptian looks, MagicFace, which was situated both in an opera house and a museum. In the first setting, people were invited to use the app, while in the second setting they came across it on their own when visiting the exhibition. Our findings show marked differences in how people approach and experience the MagicFace in these different contexts. We discuss how realistic and compelling this kind of AR technology is, as well as its implications for educational and cultural settings.

As a mode of scientific inquiry, citizen science has the potential to ""scale up"" scientific data collection efforts and increase lay engagement with science. However, current technological directions risk losing sight of the ways in which citizen science is actually practiced. As citizen science is increasingly used to describe a wide range of activities, we begin by presenting a framework of citizen science genres. We then present findings from four interlocking qualitative studies and technological interventions of community air quality monitoring efforts, examining the motivations and capacities of citizen participants and characterizing their alignment with different types of citizen science. Based on these studies, we suggest that data acquisition involves complex multi-dimensional tradeoffs, and the commonly held view that citizen science systems are a win-win for citizens and science may be overstated.

There is already strong evidence that mobile videos are a good vehicle for public health information dissemination, but there remain open questions around sustainability, appropriate target users, consumption patterns, content, and usage models. We analyse log and interview data of 42 community health workers (who were first time smartphone users) from a longitudinal 17-month deployment to better understand how the utility of mobile videos played out over time in rural Lesotho. During the study period, videos were viewed at an average of 170 times per month, for a total of 2898 views. Through this data we draw these primary findings: a) pausing is not contextually necessary, b) age is not a barrier to usage, c) the primary predictor of popularity of a given video is topical relevance and national campaigns, d) there is no apparent relationship between video length, popularity and completion rates, and e) new videos have only a short-lived novelty effect. Furthermore, we affirm that regular engagement with CHWs has an impact on continued usage, in addition to being important for reducing attrition due to technical issues.

Toward realistic hands gesture interface: Keeping it simple for developers and machines,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025508,37,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p1887.pdf,"
Development of a rich hand-gesture-based interface is currently a tedious process, requiring expertise in computer vision and/or machine learning. We address this problem by introducing a simple language for pose and gesture description, a set of development tools for using it, and an algorithmic pipeline that recognizes it with high accuracy. The language is based on a small set of basic propositions, obtained by applying four predicate types to the fingers and to palm center: direction, relative location, finger touching and finger folding state. This enables easy development of a gesture-based interface, using coding constructs, gesture definition files or an editing GUI. The language is recognized from 3D camera input with an algorithmic pipeline composed of multiple classification/regression stages, trained on a large annotated dataset. Our experimental results indicate that the pipeline enables successful gesture recognition with a very low computational load, thus enabling a gesture-based interface on low-end processors.

Our analysis of 60 papers that seriously engaged with trajectories reveals the purposes that the framework served and which parts of it they used. We compare our findings to the originally stated goals of trajectories and to subsequent claims of its status as both theory and strong concept. The results shed new light on what we mean by theory in HCI, including its relationship to practice and to other disciplines.

When people hold their smartphone in landscape orientation, they use their thumbs for input on the frontal touchscreen, while their remaining fingers rest on the back of the device (BoD) to stabilize the grip. We present BackXPress, a new interaction technique that lets users create BoD pressure input with these remaining fingers to augment their interaction with the touchscreen on the front: Users can apply various pressure levels with each of these fingers to enter different temporary ""quasi-modes"" that are only active as long as that pressure is applied. Both thumbs can then interact with the frontal screen in that mode. We illustrate the practicality of BackXPress with several sample applications, and report our results from three user studies: Study 1 investigated which fingers can be used to exert BoD pressure and found index, middle, and ring finger from both hands to be practical. Study 2 revealed how pressure touches from these six fingers are distributed across the BoD. Study 3 examined user performance for applying BoD pressure (a) during single touches at the front and (b) for 20 seconds while touching multiple consecutive frontal targets. Participants achieved up to 92% pressure accuracy for three separate pressure levels above normal resting pressure, with the middle fingers providing the highest accuracy. BoD pressure did not affect frontal touch accuracy. We conclude with design guidelines for BoD pressure input.

First, analysis of questions posted in online health forums helped us identify patients' information needs. Findings from an elicitation study with seven radiologists provided necessary domain knowledge to guide prototype design. Finally, a clinical field study with 14 pediatric patients, their parents and clinicians, revealed positive responses of each stakeholder when using the prototype to interact with and discuss the patient's current CT or MRI report and allowed us to distill three use cases: co-located communication, preparing for the consultation, and reviewing radiology data.

The human skin provides an ample, always-on surface for input to smart watches, mobile phones, and remote displays.

We present an in-depth study in which participants placed 30 items on the hand and forearm and attempted to recall their locations. We found that participants used a variety of landmarks, personal associations, and semantic groupings in placing the items on the skin. Although participants most frequently used anatomical landmarks (e.g., fingers, joints, and nails), recall rates were higher for items placed on personal landmarks, including scars and tattoos. We further found that personal associations between items improved recall, and that participants often grouped important items in similar areas, such as family members on the nails. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for design of skin-based interfaces.

Social robots that physically display emotion invite natural communication with their human interlocutors, enabling applications like robot-assisted therapy where a complex robot's breathing influences human emotional and physiological state.

We developed low-cost techniques for coupled iteration of a simple robot's body and behaviour, and evaluated its potential to display emotion. Through two user studies, we (1) validated these CuddleBits' ability to express emotions (N=20); (2) sourced a corpus of 72 robot emotion behaviours from participants (N=10); and (3) analyzed it to link underlying parameters to emotional perception (N=14). We found that CuddleBits can express arousal (activation), and to a lesser degree valence (pleasantness). We also show how a sketch-refine paradigm combined with DIY fabrication and novel input methods enable parametric design of physical emotion display, and discuss how mastering this parsimonious case can give insight into layering simple behaviours in more complex robots.

In this note, we present minimal robot movements for robotic technology for children. Two types of minimal gaze movements were designed: social-gaze movements to communicate social engagement and deictic-gaze movements to communicate task-related referential information. In a two (social-gaze movements vs. none) by two (deictic-gaze movements vs. none) video-based study (n=72), we found that social-gaze movements significantly increased children's perception of animacy and likeability of the robot. Deictic-gaze and social-gaze movements significantly increased children's perception of helpfulness. Our findings show the compelling communicative power of social-gaze movements, and to a lesser extent deictic-gaze movements, and have implications for designers who want to achieve animacy, likeability and helpfulness with simple and easily implementable minimal robot movements. Our work contributes to human-robot interaction research and design by providing a first indication of the potential of minimal robot movements to communicate social engagement and helpful referential information to children.

Object manipulation in 3D virtual environments demands a combined coordination of rotations, translations and scales, as well as the camera control to change the user's viewpoint. Then, for many manipulation tasks, it would be advantageous to share the interaction complexity among team members. In this paper we propose a novel 3D manipulation interface based on a collaborative action coordination approach. Our technique explores a smartphone -- the touchscreen and inertial sensors -- as input interface, enabling several users to collaboratively manipulate the same virtual object with their own devices. We first assessed our interface design on a docking and an obstacle crossing tasks with teams of two users. Then, we conducted a study with 60 users to understand the influence of group size in collaborative 3D manipulation. We evaluated teams in combinations of one, two, three and four participants. Experimental results show that teamwork increases accuracy when compared with a single user. The accuracy increase is correlated with the number of individuals in the team and their work division strategy.

""Remind me to get milk later this afternoon."" In communications and planning, people often express uncertainty about time using imprecise temporal expressions (ITEs). Unfortunately, modern virtual assistants often lack system support to capture the intents behind these expressions. This can result in unnatural interactions and undesirable interruptions (e.g., having a work reminder delivered at 12pm when out at lunch, because the user said ""this afternoon""). In this paper we explore existing practices, expectations, and preferences surrounding the use of ITEs. Our mixed methods approach employs surveys, interviews, and an analysis of a large corpus of written communications. We find that people frequently use a diverse set of ITEs in both communication and planning. These uses reflect a variety of motivations, such as conveying uncertainty or task priority. In addition, we find that people have a variety of expectations about time input and management when interacting with virtual assistants. We conclude with design implications for future virtual assistants.

Graphical user interfaces are composed of varying elements (text, images, etc.) whose visual arrangement has been relatively well established in the context of rectangular interfaces. The advent of non-rectangular displays questions this knowledge. In this paper we study how traditional content layouts can be adapted to fit different non-rectangular displays. We performed a first qualitative study where graphic designers fitted text and images into different non-rectangular displays. From the analysis of their output we generalize and adapt ten composition principles that have been proposed in the literature for rectangular displays. We evaluate the revised principles through a paired comparison questionnaire where 57 participants compared pairs of layouts. Using the Bradley-Terry-Luce model to analyze our data we show that some results contradict current conventions on visual design for rectangular displays. We then extracted the most interesting cases and conducted a follow up study with additional shapes to investigate how the principles generalize. From these results we propose a set of guidelines for designing visual content for non-rectangular displays.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted in 2015-2016, we underscore the reconfigurations that have resulted from this access, as evolving internet users reconfigure their interactions with place, time, and individuals in their efforts to locate the internet. We also discuss the implications our findings have for the design of internet access interventions in Cuba and in other low-resource environments across the world, as well as the broader implications for social computing across diverse geographies.

Do-it-yourself (DIY) inspired activities have gained popularity as a means of creative expression and self-directed learning. However, DIY culture is difficult to implement in places with limited technology infrastructure and traditional learning cultures. Our goal is to understand how learners in such a setting react to DIY activities. We present observations from a physical computing workshop with 12 students (13-15 years old) conducted at a high school in India. We observed unique challenges for these students when tackling DIY activities: a high monetary and psychological cost to exploration, limited independent learning resources, difficulties with finding intellectual courage and assumed technical language proficiency. Our participants, however, overcome some of these challenges by adopting their own local strategies: resilience, nonverbal and verbal learning techniques, and creating documentation and fallback circuit versions. Based on our findings, we discuss a set of lessons learned about makerspaces in a context with socio-technical challenges.

Mainstream crowdwork platforms treat microtasks as indivisible units; however, in this article, we propose that there is value in re-examining this assumption. We argue that crowdwork platforms can improve their value proposition for all stakeholders by supporting subcontracting within microtasks. After describing the value proposition of subcontracting, we then define three models for microtask subcontracting: real-time assistance, task management, and task improvement, and reflect on potential use cases and implementation considerations associated with each. Finally, we describe the outcome of two tasks on Mechanical Turk meant to simulate aspects of subcontracting. We reflect on the implications of these findings for the design of future crowd work platforms that effectively harness the potential of subcontracting workflows.

A number of interventions exist to support older adults in ageing well and these typically involve support for an active and sociable ageing process. We set out to examine the privacy implications of an intervention that would monitor mobility and share lifestyle and health data with a community of trusted others. We took a privacy-by-design approach to the system in the early stages of its development, working with older adults to firstly understand their networks of trust and secondly understand their privacy concerns should information be exchanged across that network. We used a Johari Windows framework in the thematic analysis of our data, concluding that the social sharing of information in later life carried significant risk. Our participants worried about the social signaling associated with data sharing and were cautious about a system that had the potential to disrupt established networks.

Current technical capabilities of mobile technologies are consolidating the interest in developing context-aware Augmented/Mixed Reality applications. Most of these applications are designed based on the Window-on-the-World (WoW) interaction paradigm. A significant decrease in cost of projection technology and advances in pico-sized projectors have spurred applications of Projective Augmented Reality. This research has focused mainly on technological development. However, there is still a need to fully understand its communicational and expressive potential. Hence, we define a conceptual paradigm that we call World-as-Support (WaS). We compare the WaS and WoW paradigms by contrasting their assumptions and cultural values, as well as through a study of an application aimed at supporting the collaborative improvisation of site-specific narratives by children. Our analysis of children's understanding of the physical and social environment and of their imaginative play allowed us to identify the affordances, strengths and weaknesses of these two paradigms.

From these observations, we identify trends in the use of physical models in architecture, which have the potential to inform the design of data physicalizations. We identify four functions of architectural modeling that can be directly adapted for use in the process of building rich data models. Finally, we discuss how the visualization community can apply observations from architecture to the design of new data physicalizations.

Religious institutions hold a significant place in daily life for the vast majority of people in the world, especially in developing countries. Yet despite their social prominence, and despite HCI's emphasis on the social context of technology, organized religion is neglected in both the HCI and ICTD literature. This paper explores the relationship that mosques in Bangladesh have with their constituencies and with technology, with an eye toward the integration of technology with existing religious institutions as a way to achieve positive social ends. We first describe a qualitative exploration of several mosque communities in Bangladesh, where we find that skepticism and pragmatism about modern technology interact in a complex way that nevertheless leaves room for technical interventions. We then describe a randomized controlled trial to study the relative value of SMS messages infused with overtly religious or secularly altruistic frames for the purpose of mosque fundraising. We find that SMS messages increase donations overall, but that their framing is significant. Messages with secular altruistic framing increased donations by 9.5%, while those with religious sentiment increased donations by 57.3%. Our findings demonstrate how technologies like SMS amplify underlying religious forces and suggest the possibility of working with religious institutions in applying positive ICT interventions.

At times, inaction may be a wise course of action. This insight lies at the heart of the design mechanism of pause. In this note, we explore the construct of pause, its rhythms, and nuances of enacting pause. Throughout, we draw on our experience engaging with pause in the multi-lifespan design of information systems for transitional justice. Five rhythms are identified: periodic hiatus, pending future event, responding to the socio-political climate, (temporary) closure, and laying fallow. In addition, we provide heuristics for managing pause and then restarting the design process. We then explore the scalability of pause from longer (e.g., multi-lifespan design) to shorter timeframes. We conclude with reflections on the potential benefits and open questions about pause as a design mechanism.

Users must manage frequent software and operating system upgrades across multiple computing devices. While current research focuses primarily on the security aspect, we investigate the user's perspective of upgrading software. Our first study (n=65) found that users delay major upgrades by an average of 80 days. We then ran a field study (n=14), beginning with in-depth observations during an operating system upgrade, followed by a four-week diary study. Very few participants prepared for upgrades (e.g., backing up files), and over half had negative reactions to the upgrade process and other changes (e.g., bugs, lost settings, unwanted features). During the upgrade process, waiting times were too long, feedback was confusing or misleading, and few had clear mental models of what was happening. Users almost never mentioned security as a concern or reason for upgrading. By contrast, interviews (n=3) with technical staff responsible for one organization's upgrades focused only on security and licensing, not user interface changes. We conclude with recommendations to improve the user's upgrade experience.

The increasing popularity of mobile crowdsourcing platforms has enabled crowd workers to accept jobs wherever/whenever they are, and also provides opportunity for task requesters to order time/location specific tasks to workers. Since workers on mobile platforms are working on the go, the situation of the workers is expected to influence their performance. However, the effects of mobile worker situations to task performance is an uninvestigated area. In this paper, our research question is, ""do worker situations affect task completion, price and quality on mobile crowdsourcing platforms?"" We draw on economics and psychology research to examine whether worker situations such as busyness, fatigue and presence of companions affect their performance. Our three-week between-subjects field experiment revealed that worker busyness caused 30.1% relative decrease of task completion rate. Mean accepted task price increased by 7.6% when workers are with companions. Worker fatigue caused 37.4% relative decrease of task quality.

Agency in mid-air interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025457,30,,"
Touchless interfaces allow users to view, control and manipulate digital content without physically touching an interface. They are being explored in a wide range of application scenarios from medical surgery to car dashboard controllers. One aspect of touchless interaction that has not been explored to date is the Sense of Agency (SoA). The SoA refers to the subjective experience of voluntary control over actions in the external world. In this paper, we investigated the SoA in touchless systems using the intentional binding paradigm. We first compare touchless systems with physical interactions and then augmented different types of haptic feedback to explore how different outcome modalities influence intentional binding. From our experiments, we demonstrated that an intentional binding effect is observed in both physical and touchless interactions with no statistical difference. Additionally, we found that haptic and auditory feedback help to increase SoA compared with visual feedback in touchless interfaces. We discuss these findings and identify design opportunities that take agency into consideration.

The incorporation of subtitles in multimedia content plays an important role in communicating spoken content. For example, subtitles in the respective language are often preferred to expensive audio translation of foreign movies. The traditional representation of subtitles displays text centered at the bottom of the screen. This layout can lead to large distances between text and relevant image content, causing eye strain and even that we miss visual content. As a recent alternative, the technique of speaker-following subtitles places subtitle text in speech bubbles close to the current speaker. We conducted a controlled eye-tracking laboratory study (n = 40) to compare the regular approach (center-bottom subtitles) with content-sensitive, speaker-following subtitles. We compared different dialog-heavy video clips with the two layouts. Our results show that speaker-following subtitles lead to higher fixation counts on relevant image regions and reduce saccade length, which is an important factor for eye strain.

Games user research (GUR) measures the performance and preference of digital game players, and interprets these measurements in the context of theories that explain human behavior. There are many validated approaches for measuring player experience that are grounded in psychological theories on motivation and emotion. Attribution theory explains how people assign causes to events and how these attributions affect peoples' emotional reactions and motivations. In this paper we argue that attribution theory can provide additional value to the existing suite of GUR tools; however, there are currently no validated tools to assess player attribution in the context of games. This paper describes the conceptualization of player attribution based on literature, presents the development and validation of a scale to assess player attribution in games, and discusses the implications of adding player attribution to the toolbox of methods for the design and evaluation of digital games.

Interactive exploration plays a critical role in large graph visualization. Existing techniques, such as zoom-and-pan on a 2D plane and hyperbolic browser facilitate large graph exploration by showing both the details of a focal area and its surrounding context that guides the exploration process. However, existing techniques for large graph exploration are limited in either providing too little context or presenting graphs with too much distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel focus+context technique, iSphere, to address the limitation. iSphere maps a large graph onto a Riemann Sphere that better preserves graph structures and shows greater context information. We conduct extensive experiment studies on different graph exploration tasks under various conditions. The results show that iSphere performs the best in task completion time compared to the baseline techniques in link and path exploration tasks. This research also contributes to understanding large graph exploration on small screens.

Live streaming services are a growing form of social media. Most live streaming platforms allow viewers to communicate with each other and the broadcaster via a text chat. However, interaction in a text chat does not work well with too many users. Existing techniques to make text chat work with a larger number of participants often limit who can participate or how much users can participate. In this paper, we describe a new design for a text chat system that allows more people to participate without overwhelming users with too many messages. Our design strategically limits the number of messages a user sees based on the concept of neighborhoods, and emphasizes important messages through upvoting. We present a study comparing our system to a chat system similar to those found in commercial streaming services. Results of the study indicate that the Conversational Circle system is easier to understand and interact with, while supporting community among viewers and highlighting important content for the streamer.

We then assess the scale of this demand by drawing comparison between our fine-grained observations and a more representative dataset of 398 devices from the Device Analyzer corpus. Our results highlight the significant categories of data demanding practice, and the identification of where changes in app time and duration of use might reduce or shift demand to reduce services' impacts.

Traditional graphic design tools emphasize the grid for structuring layout. Interviews with professional graphic designers revealed that they use surprisingly sophisticated structures that go beyond the grid, which we call graphical substrates. We present a framework to describe how designers establish graphical substrates based on properties extracted from concepts, content and context, and use them to compose layouts in both space and time. We developed two technology probes to explore how to embed graphical substrates into tools. Contextify lets designers tailor layouts according to each reader's intention and context; while Linkify lets designers create dynamic layouts based on relationships among content properties. We tested the probes with professional graphic designers, who all identified novel uses in their current projects. We incorporated their suggestions into StyleBlocks, a prototype that reifies CSS declarations into interactive graphical substrates. Graphical substrates offer an untapped design space for tools that can help graphic designers generate personal layout structures.

Moreover, when the magnetic sheets are rubbed together, unique haptic stimuli are displayed on the fingers. The haptic stimuli can be changed by the magnetic patterns designed on the rubber sheets. We developed a prototype of the Magnetic Plotter and investigated the range of the generated haptic stimuli and the texture design possibilities.

For example, a concave display can maintain content in comfortable reach for a single user, while a convex shape can support several users engaged on individual tasks. MistForm also enables unique interaction possibilities by exploiting the synergies between shape changing interfaces and mid-air fog displays. For instance, moving the screen will affect the brightness and blurriness of the screen at specific locations around the display, creating spaces with similar (collaboration) or different visibility (personalized content). We describe the design of MistForm and analyse its inherent challenges, such as image distortion and uneven brightness on dynamic curved surfaces. We provide a machine learning approach to characterize the shape of the screen and a rendering algorithm to remove aberrations. We finally explore novel interactive possibilities and reflect on their potential and limitations.

The way drivers operate in-car systems is rapidly changing as traditional physical controls, such as buttons and dials, are being replaced by touchscreens and touch-sensing surfaces. This has the potential to increase driver distraction and error as controls may be harder to find and use. This paper presents an in-car, on the road driving study which examined three key types of input controls to investigate their effects: a physical dial, pressure-based input on a touch surface and touch input on a touchscreen. The physical dial and pressure-based input were also evaluated with and without haptic feedback. The study was conducted with users performing a list-based targeting task using the different controls while driving on public roads. Eye-gaze was recorded to measure distraction from the primary task of driving. The results showed that target accuracy was high across all input methods (greater than 94%). Pressure-based targeting was the slowest while directly tapping on the targets was the faster selection method. Pressure-based input also caused the largest number of glances towards to the touchscreen but the duration of each glance was shorter than directly touching the screen. Our study will enable designers to make more appropriate design choices for future in-car interactions.

To unpick this, we contribute an account of its initial use in the community, and then describe findings from research engagements with carers and people with dementia. These workshops used Care and Connect to structure discussions of participants' own experiences of dementia-friendliness, and uncovered themes of 1) trust, 2) exclusion versus inclusion, 3) duration and quality of time, and 4) empathy becoming action.

We present results from a mixed-methods study with 327 participants who are students and alumnae of a women's college. Our findings shed light on the complex relationships of women with games, with other gamers, and with gaming culture and industry. The results also indicate that in some cases gender-related negative experiences of gaming have lasting impact on the participation and self-confidence of young women.

There is a growing interest in HCI research to explore cross-device interaction, giving rise to an interest in different approaches facilitating interaction between handheld devices and large displays.

We look specifically at their relative efficiency, effectiveness and accuracy in bi-directional interaction between a smartphone and large display in a point-click context. We report findings from two user studies, which show that swiping is both most effective, fastest and most accurate, closely followed by swinging. What these two approaches have in common is the ability to keep the pointer steady on the large display, unaffected by concurrent gestures or body movements used to complete the interaction, suggesting that this is an important factor for designing effective cross-device interaction with large displays.

In the turn towards practice-oriented research in interaction design, one of the most important proposals has been the emphasis on the 'ultimate particulars' produced by design, as embodiments of design knowledge. In current HCI research, those particulars are almost always taken to be 'things' artefacts or singular systems. We argue that this emphasis may have come at a cost that can be described as a loss of identity; interaction design research was never primarily concerned with the design of artefacts, but with how humans act and interact with each other with and through artefacts. We propose a complementary perspective by looking at design projects and traditions where the 'ultimate particulars' can be considered to be activities rather than things. The article is concerned with how knowledge needs to be articulated in the scholarly engagement with such design practices. We argue that engagement with activity-centric design gets design research one step closer towards understanding salient contemporary design practices and what Buchanan calls 'environmental design'.

We introduce three design strategies to embed the hotkey, a visual encoding to convey the modifiers, and a magnification factor that determines the blending ratio between the pictogram of the button and the visual representation of the keyboard shortcut. Two studies examine the benefits of IconHK for end-users and provide insights from professional designers on the practicality of our approach for creating iconsets. Building on these insights, we develop a tool to assist designers in applying the IconHK design principle.

Trajectories of engagement and disengagement with a story-based smoking cessation app,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026054,32,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/106703/1/C34%20CHI2017%20trajectories%20of%20engagement.pdf,"
Strong user engagement with digital technologies for behaviour change is often taken as a precursor to their longer-term efficacy. We critically examine this assumption through a qualitative study of a smoking cessation app, called NewLeaf, which allows quitters to swap personal stories. The study examined what influenced people to engage or disengage with NewLeaf, and how the app was deployed in quit attempts during a four week trial. Several properties of swapped stories were reported to promote engagement, including: authenticity, currency, contextualization of advice, and evoking a sense of community. But while the resulting engagement was sometimes productive in supporting quitting, other trajectories of use were observed involving counterproductive engagement, and a surprising pattern of productive disengagement especially among stronger quitters. We discuss how this analysis of different trajectories problematizes any simple interpretation of user engagement as an early indicator of success for behaviour change technologies.

Understanding the role of human senses in interactive meditation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026000,29,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p4960.pdf,"
In our fast-paced society, stress and anxiety have become increasingly common. Meditation for relaxation has received much attention. Meditation apps exploit various senses, e.g., touch, audio and vision, but the relationship between human senses and interactive meditation is not well understood. This paper empirically evaluates the effects of single and combined human senses on interactive meditation. We found that the effectiveness of human senses can be defined by their respective roles in maintaining the balance between relaxation and focus. This work is the first to attempt to understand these relationships. The findings have broad implications for the field of multi-modal interaction and interactive meditation applications.

Content personalization automatically modifying text and multimedia features within articles based on the reader's individual features'is evolving as a new form of journalism. Informed by constraints articulated through a survey of journalists, we have implemented PersaLog, a novel system for creating personalized content (e.g., text and interactive visualizations). Because crafting, and validating, personalized content can be challenging to scale across articles (unlike feed personalization), we offer a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL), and editing environment, to support this task. PersaLog is particularly designed to support the personalization of existing text and visualizations. Our work provides guidelines for personalization as well as a system that allows for both subtle and dramatic personalization-driven content changes. We validate PersaLog using case and lab studies.

Americans' health has reached a dangerous obesity epidemic from overconsumption and unhealthy food choices. In response, persuasive games for health encourage healthier lifestyles typically by providing positive reinforcement for the desired behaviors. However, positive reinforcement is only one of the many possibly effective approaches. We explore two types of message framing in a nutrition game, Monster Appetite (MA). In MA, players' choices of high or low calorie snacks impact visual appearance of their monster avatar. MA utilizes two types of health messages: subversive, which encourages players to make unhealthy choices and focuses on costs, and inoculation, which encourages players to eventually defend healthy choices and focuses on benefits. We test message framing's effect by tracking users' purchasing behavior in our online snack shop, Snackazon. The study showed that when positive messages were embedded in MA mixed with negative visuals through the monster avatars, participants exhibited better snack choices post-gameplay.

""Mirroring"" refers to the unconscious mimicry of another person's behaviors, such as their facial expressions. Mirroring has many positive effects, such as enhancing closeness and improving the flow of a conversation, which enriches the quality of communication. Our study set out to devise a means of evoking these positive effects in a video chat without any conscious effort of participants. We constructed a videophone system, called FaceShare, which can deform the user's face into a smile in response to their partner's smiling. That is, our system generates mirroring by producing a pseudo-smile through image processing. We conducted an experiment in which pairs of participants had brief conversations via FaceShare. The results implied that mirroring using the pseudo-smile lets the mimicker, whose face is deformed according to the expressions of their partner, feel a closeness, and improves the flow of the conversation for both the mimicker and the mimickee, who sees the mimicker's deformed face.

Within vehicle Human Machine Interface design, visual displays are predominant, taking up more and more of the visual channel for each new system added to the car, e.g. navigation systems, blind spot information and forward collision warnings. Sounds however, are mainly used to alert or warn drivers together with visual information. In this study we investigated the design of auditory displays for advisory information, by designing a 3D auditory advisory traffic information system (3DAATIS) which was evaluated in a drive simulator study with 30 participants. Our findings indicate that overall, drivers' performance and situation awareness improved when using this system. But, more importantly, the results also point towards the advantages and limitations of the use of advisory 3D-sounds in cars, e.g. attention capture vs. limited auditory resolution.

AlterNail integrates a batteryless design using inductive coupling with e-ink technology to enable both quick dynamic and long-term static fingernail based visual designs without the need for power. We also detail the use of simple vibrational signals to uniquely identify everyday objects as they are handled using AlterNails. The intentionally limited interactional functionality of AlterNails, coupled with the rich personal and dynamic expressive potential, combine to present a compelling range of opportunities for designers of new interactive wearable technologies. We detail a range of practical and playful applications using this technology.

Comparing the reliability of Amazon Mechanical Turk and Survey Monkey to traditional market research surveys,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053335,130,,"
In the product design process, it is often desirable to quickly obtain information about current user behaviors for topics that cannot be obtained through existing data or instrumentation. Perhaps we would like to understand the use of products we do not have access to or perhaps the action we would like to know about (such as using a coupon) is an action taken outside of a system that can be instrumented. Traditionally, large market research surveys would be conducted to answer these questions, but often designers need answers much faster. We present a study investigating the reliability of fast survey platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Survey Monkey as compared to larger market research studies for technology behavior research and show that results can be obtained in hours for much smaller costs with accuracy within 10% of traditional larger surveys. This demonstrates that we can rely more heavily on these platforms in the product design process and provide much faster planning iterations that are informed by actual usage data.

We explored new interaction scenarios that can be realized when a touchpad outputs fast and high-resolution spatio-temporal tactile patterns to the touch-sensitive skin on the fingertips of a user. We first constructed a special tactile multi-touch touchpad called PinPad, which was capable of outputting fast and high-resolution tactile patterns using a 40 x 25 array of actuated pins. We then developed various interaction scenarios that could be realized using the prototype: 1) Tactile Target, 2) Guide and Constraint, 3) Multi-finger Output, and 4) Dynamic Partition. To evaluate the PinPad scenarios, we implemented demo applications, and conducted interviews with users to collect feedback about their experiences with PinPad and the PinPad scenarios. The participants confirmed the effectiveness of spatio-temporal outputs of PinPad in the scenarios. In particular, they provided diverse feedback regarding the unique tactile experiences of the fast and high-resolution outputs of PinPad.

Chatbots and conversational assistants are becoming increasingly popular. However, for information seeking scenarios, these systems still have very limited conversational abilities, and primarily serve as proxies to existing web search engines. In this work, we ask: what would conversational search look like with a truly intelligent assistant? To begin answering this question empirically, we conduct a user study, in which 21 participants are each given 3 information seeking tasks to solve using a text-based chat interface. To complete each task, participants conversed with three conversational agents: an existing commercial system, a human expert, and a perceived experimental automatic system, backed by a human 'wizard' behind the curtain. The observations and insights of our study help us understand the aspirations of users and the limitations of the current conversational agents -- and to sharpen a frontier of work required to improve conversational assistants for search scenarios.

Prior research has discovered various privacy concerns that bystanders have about drones. However, little is known about drone controllers' privacy perceptions and practices of drones. Understanding controllers' perspective is important because it will inform whether controllers' current practices protect or infringe on bystanders' privacy and what mechanisms could be designed to better address the potential privacy issues of drones. In this paper, we report results from interviews of 12 drone controllers in the US. Our interviewees treated safety as their top priority but considered privacy issues of drones exaggerated. Our results also highlight many significant differences in how controllers and bystanders think about drone privacy, for instance, how they determine public vs. private spaces and whether notice and consent of bystanders are needed.

We present an approach to alter the perceived appearance of physical objects by controlling their surrounding space. Many real-world objects cannot easily be equipped with displays or actuators in order to change their shape. While common approaches such as projection mapping enable changing the appearance of objects without modifying them, certain surface properties (e.g. highly reflective or transparent surfaces) can make employing these techniques difficult. In this work, we present a conceptual design exploration on how the appearance of an object can be changed by solely altering the space around it, rather than the object itself. In a proof-of-concept implementation, we place objects onto a tabletop display and track them together with users to display perspective-corrected 3D graphics for augmentation. This enables controlling properties such as the perceived size, color, or shape of objects. We characterize the design space of our approach and demonstrate potential applications. For example, we change the contour of a wallet to notify users when their bank account is debited. We envision our approach to gain in importance with increasing ubiquity of display surfaces.

In this paper, we present a new game genre which combines user-controlled game design in physical space with game play in virtual space on a mobile device. The new system supports authoring by anyone, creating virtual reality games that can be easily modified or developed for physical space, and be used anywhere by novice end-users without any knowledge of tracking technology.

Avatar customization is a feature that is offered in many computer and video games. Customization options are presented to users via Character Creation Interfaces or CCIs. CCIs differ greatly between games, independent of genre, with regard to the quantity and quality of customization options available. In addition, the way in which these options are presented to users differs from game to game. Research on avatar customization is typically focused on user-avatar identity or self-representation. In general, we have found that the User Experience (UX) of avatar customization has been greatly overlooked in academic literature. As such, we look to existing research on UX in order to propose how its methodologies may be used to study the impact of CCI affordances on player experience in games.

Interactive playgrounds are spaces where players engage in collocated, playful activities, in which added digital technology can be designed to promote cognitive, social, and motor skills development. To promote such development, different strategies can be used to implement game mechanics that change player's in-game behavior. One of such strategies is enticing players to take action through incentives akin to game achievements. We explored if this strategy could be used to influence players' proxemic behavior in the Interactive Tag Playground, an installation that enhances the traditional game of tag. We placed the ITP in an art gallery, observed hundreds of play sessions, and refined the mechanics, which consisted in projecting collectible particles around the tagger that upon collection by runners resulted only in the embellishment of their circles. We implemented the refined mechanics in a study with 48 children. The playground automatically collected the players' positions, and analyses show that runners got closer to and moved more towards taggers when using our enticing strategy. This suggests an enticing strategy can be used to influence physical in-game behavior.

Recent digital fabrication tools have enabled new form-giving using a wide range of physical materials. However, light as a first class creative material has been largely ignored within the design of our electronic objects.

We introduce a digital design tool that simulates and visualizes physical light interactions with a variety of materials for creating custom luminaires. We further develop a computational design and fabrication process for creating custom secondary optics elements (SOEs), which provides additional handles for users to physically shape and redirect light to compose, fill, and evenly diffuse planar and volumetric geometries. Through a workshop study with novice electronic designers, we show how incorporating physical techniques to shape light alters how users view the role and function of LEDs and electronics. We produce example pieces that showcase how our approach expands the electronics aesthetic and discuss how viewing light as material can engender novel, expressive artifacts.

The American Voter - a seminal work in political science - uncovered the multifaceted nature of voting behavior which has been corroborated in electoral research for decades since. In this paper, we leverage The American Voter as an analysis framework in the realm of computational political science, employing the factors of party, personality, and policy to structure the analysis of public discourse on online social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries. Our analysis of 50 million tweets reveals the continuing importance of these three factors; our understanding is also enriched by the application of sentiment analysis techniques. The overwhelmingly negative sentiment of conversations surrounding 10 major presidential candidates reveals more ""crosstalk"" from Democratic leaning users towards Republican candidates, and less vice-versa. We uncover the lack of moderation as the most discussed personality dimension during this campaign season, as the political field becomes more extreme - Clinton and Rubio are perceived as moderate, while Trump, Sanders, and Cruz are not. While the most discussed issues are foreign policy and immigration, Republicans tweet more about abortion than Democrats who tweet more about gay rights than Republicans. Finally, we illustrate the importance of multifaceted political discourse analysis by applying regression to quantify the impact of party, personality, and policy on national polls.

Research has explored different ways of improving crowd ideation, such as presenting examples or employing facilitators. While such support is usually generated through peripheral tasks delegated to crowd workers who are not part of the ideation, it is possible that the ideators themselves could benefit from the extra thought involved in doing them. Therefore, we iterate over an ideation system in which ideators can perform one of three peripheral tasks (rating originality and usefulness, similarity, or idea combination) on demand. In controlled experiments with workers on Mechanical Turk, we compare the effects of these secondary tasks to simple idea exposure or no support at all, examining usage of the inspirations, fluency, breadth, and depth of ideas generated. We find tasks to be as good or better than exposure, although this depends on the period of ideation and the fluency level. We also discuss implications of inspiration size, homogeneity, and frequency.

This paper introduces BIGnav, a new multiscale navigation technique based on Bayesian Experimental Design where the criterion is to maximize the information-theoretic concept of mutual information, also known as information gain. Rather than simply executing user navigation commands, BIGnav interprets user input to update its knowledge about the user's intended target. Then it navigates to a new view that maximizes the information gain provided by the user's expected subsequent input. We conducted a controlled experiment demonstrating that BIGnav is significantly faster than conventional pan and zoom and requires fewer commands for distant targets, especially in non-uniform information spaces. We also applied BIGnav to a realistic application and showed that users can navigate to highly probable points of interest on a map with only a few steps. We then discuss the tradeoffs of BIGnav--including efficiency vs. increased cognitive load--and its application to other interaction tasks.

Zensei could allow many objects to recognize users. E.g., phones that unlock when held, cars that automatically adjust mirrors and seats, or power tools that restore user settings. We introduce wide-spectrum bioimpedance hardware that measures both amplitude and phase. It extends previous approaches through multi-electrode sensing and high-speed wireless data collection for embedded devices. We implement the sensing in devices and furniture, where unique electrode configurations generate characteristic profiles based on user's unique electrical properties. Finally, we discuss results from a comprehensive longitudinal 22-day data collection experiment with 46 subjects. Our analysis shows promising classification accuracy and low false acceptance rate.

We describe a qualitative study, comprised of interviews, design workshops and probes, that investigated the social and community support practices of carers. Our findings highlight issues related to becoming and recognising being a carer, and feelings of being ignored by, and isolated from, others. We also note the benefits that sharing between carers can bring, and routes to coping and relaxing from the burdens of care.

When human partners attend to peripheral computing devices while interacting with conversational robots, the inability of the robots to determine the actual engagement level of the human partners after gaze shift may cause communication breakdown. In this paper, we propose a real-time perception model for robots to estimate human partners' engagement dynamics, and investigate different robot behavior strategies to handle ambiguities in humans' status and ensure the flow of the conversation. In particular, we define four novel types of engagement status and propose a real-time engagement inference model that weighs humans' social signals dynamically according to the involvement of the computing devices. We further design two robot behavior strategies (explicit and implicit) to help resolve uncertainties in engagement inference and mitigate the impact of uncoupling, based on an annotated human-human interaction video corpus. We conducted a within-subject experiment to assess the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed engagement inference model and behavior strategies. Results show that robots with our engagement model can deliver better service and smoother conversations as an assistant, and people find the implicit strategy more polite and appropriate.

We explore the relative merits of matrix, node-link and combined side-by-side views for the visualisation of weighted networks with three controlled studies: (1) finding the most effective visual encoding for weighted edges in matrix representations; (2) comparing matrix, node-link and combined views for static weighted networks; and (3) comparing MatrixWave, Sankey and combined views of both for event-sequence data. Our studies underline that node-link and matrix views are suited to different analysis tasks. For the combined view, our studies show that there is a perceptually complementary effect in terms of improved accuracy for some tasks, but that there is a cost in terms of longer completion time than the faster of the two techniques alone. Eye-movement data shows that for many tasks participants strongly favour one of the two views, after trying both in the training phase.

Towards understanding differential privacy: When do people trust randomized response technique?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025698,23,https://evanpeck.github.io/files/papers/diffPrivacy_chi2017.pdf,"
As a consequence of living in a data ecosystem, we often relinquish personal information to be used in contexts in which we have no control. In this paper, we begin to examine the usability of differential privacy, a mechanism that proposes to promise privacy with a mathematical ""proof"" to the data donor. Do people trust this promise and adjust their privacy decisions if the interfaces through which they interact make differential privacy less opaque? In a study with 228 participants, we measured comfort, understanding, and trust using a variant of differential privacy known as Randomized Response Technique (RRT). We found that allowing individuals to see the amount of obfuscation applied to their responses increased their trust in the privacy-protecting mechanism. However, participants who associated obfuscating privacy mechanisms with deception did not make the ""safest"" privacy decisions, even as they demonstrated an understanding of RRT. We demonstrate that prudent privacy-related decisions can be cultivated with simple explanations of usable privacy.

Although public displays are increasingly being deployed in everyday situations, they are still mostly used as auto-active information sources. Adding interactivity can help to attract and engage users. We report on the design and in-the-wild evaluation of an interactive advert for a public display in a tourist information center. We evaluate and compare 3 different variants - non-interactive, interaction using body tracking, and interaction using personal mobile devices - with respect to attracting the attention and interaction from passersby. We further compare these variants with an iterated version of the body tracking system with an extended tracking area. Our findings include an unexpected reluctance of passersby to use their mobile device in public, and the increased interactive area for body interaction resulting in increased engagement and spontaneous multi-user interaction, while removing the so-called 'landing effect'. Based on our findings, we suggest guidelines for interactive adverts on public displays.

Leveraging human routine models to detect and generate human behaviors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025571,25,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p6683.pdf,"
An ability to detect behaviors that negatively impact people's wellbeing and show people how they can correct those behaviors could enable technology that improves people's lives. Existing supervised machine learning approaches to detect and generate such behaviors require lengthy and expensive data labeling by domain experts. In this work, we focus on the domain of routine behaviors, where we model routines as a series of frequent actions that people perform in specific situations. We present an approach that bypasses labeling each behavior instance that a person exhibits. Instead, we weakly label instances using people's demonstrated routine. We classify and generate new instances based on the probability that they belong to the routine model. We illustrate our approach on an example system that helps drivers become aware of and understand their aggressive driving behaviors. Our work enables technology that can trigger interventions and help people reflect on their behaviors when those behaviors are likely to negatively impact them.

Why players use pings and annotations in Dota 2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025967,26,http://www.hcitang.org/papers/2017-chi2017-dota2.pdf,"
Groupware research has long focused on representing gestures as a means to facilitate collaboration. However, this work has not led to wide support of gesturing in commercial groupware systems. In contrast, Dota 2, a popular MOBA game, provides two frequently-used gesturing tools: annotations - freely drawn lines on top of the gamespace - and pings - a combination of animation and sound indicating a point of interest. While gesturing tools are important for quickly coordinating with teammates in Dota 2, there is little information about how and why people use them. To gather this information, we performed two complementary studies: an interaction analysis of eight game replays, and a survey of 167 experienced players. Our findings include: six distinct motivations for the use of gesturing tools; when and how frequently gesture motivations occur during games; and, that players find pings an essential tool for winning, but not annotations. Our findings provide new directions for the design of gesturing tools in groupware and online games.

ProtoMold: An interactive vacuum forming system for rapid prototyping,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025498,26,,"
In this paper, we propose a novel fabrication machine called ProtoMold, which uses interactive vacuum forming system for rapid prototyping. ProtoMold combines a dynamical shape-changing surface that consists of 12 × 8 linear actuators and a vacuum forming system. According to the shape of the surface, this system can mold various 2.5 dimensional objects quickly. Another characteristic of this system is that users can reuse molded objects and change their design; by applying tension and heat to a molded object, the object becomes flat and can be molded again. We also designed user several interaction methods for manipulating ProtoMold. In addition to loading predesigned data, the user can control the shape of the pin display directly using gesture input or physical objects. We propose several use scenarios for ProtoMold: changing the design of a plate based on objects placed on it, fabricating a facemask with a printed texture, and fabricating electrical devices with printed electronic circuits. By using this system, we conducted a user test and discuss the known limitations and potential applications of our system.

The recent integration of thermal cameras with commodity smartphones presents an opportunity to engage the public in evaluating energy-efficiency issues in the built environment. However, it is unclear how novice users without professional experience or training approach thermographic energy auditing activities. In this paper, we recruited 10 participants for a four-week field study of end-user behavior exploring novice approaches to semi-structured thermographic energy auditing tasks. We analyze thermographic imagery captured by participants as well as weekly surveys and post-study debrief interviews. Our findings suggest that while novice users perceived thermal cameras as useful in identifying energy-efficiency issues in buildings, they struggled with interpretation and confidence. We characterize how novices perform thermographic-based energy auditing, synthesize key challenges, and discuss implications for design.

Where usability and security go hand-in-hand: Robust gesture-based authentication for mobile systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025879,27,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025879,"
Gestures have recently gained interest as a secure and usable authentication method for mobile devices. Gesture authentication relies on recognition, wherein raw data is collected from user input and preprocessed into a more manageable form before applying recognition algorithms. Preprocessing is done to improve recognition accuracy, but little work has been done in justifying its effects on authentication. We examined the effects of three variables: location, rotation, and scale, on authentication accuracy. We found that an authentication-optimal combination (location invariant, scale variant, and rotation variant) can reduce the error rate by 45.3% on average compared to the recognition-optimal combination (all invariant). We analyzed 13 gesture recognizers and evaluated them with three criteria: authentication accuracy, and resistance against both brute-force and imitation attacks. Our novel multi-expert method (Garda) achieved the lowest error rate (0.015) in authentication accuracy, the lowest error rate (0.040) under imitation attacks, and resisted all brute-force attacks.

Crowd diversity and performance in wikipedia: The mediating effects of task conflict and communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025992,25,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p6342.pdf,"
Crowd diversity is a key attribute that impacts crowd performance in online collaboration systems. As a structural composition of a crowd, diversity is likely to influence crowd performance through communication processes during collaboration. This study examined how diversity influenced crowd performance under different conditions of task conflict and communication in Wikipedia article production. With a sample of 5,899 articles, we found that contribution diversity positively predicted crowd performance, whereas experience diversity was negatively related to performance. In addition, task communication and conflict partially mediated the relationship between crowd diversity and performance. Task communication positively predicted performance for both forms of diversity. Task conflict, on the other hand, was positively predicted by expertise diversity, but had negative associations with contribution diversity and performance. The findings help unpack the reasons for differential effects of diversity on crowd performance, and demonstrate the importance of including communication variables when studying online crowd collaboration.

ForceEdge: controlling autoscroll on both desktop and mobile computers using the force,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025605,25,https://lilloa.univ-lille.fr/bitstream/handle/20.500.12210/24318/https:/hal.inria.fr/hal-01444366/document?sequence=1,"
Operating systems support autoscroll to allow users to scroll a view while in dragging mode: the user moves the pointer near the window's edge to trigger an ""automatic"" scrolling whose rate is typically proportional to the distance between the pointer and the window's edge. This approach suffers from several problems, especially when the window is maximized, resulting in a very limited space around it. Another problem is that for some operations, such as object drag-and-drop, the source and destination might be located in different windows, making it complicated for the computer to understand user's intention. In this paper, we present ForceEdge, a novel autoscroll technique relying on touch surfaces with force-sensing capabilities to alleviate the problems related to autoscroll. We report on the results of three controlled experiments showing that it improves over macOS and iOS systems baselines for top-to-bottom select and move tasks.

Online experimentation with volunteers could be described as a form of citizen science in which participants take part in behavioral studies without financial compensation. However, while citizen science projects aim to improve scientific understanding, volunteer-based online experiment platforms currently provide minimal possibilities for research involvement and learning. The goal of this paper is to uncover opportunities for expanding participant involvement and learning in the research process. Analyzing comments from 8,288 volunteers who took part in four online experiments on LabintheWild, we identified six themes that reveal needs and opportunities for closer interaction between researchers and participants. Our findings demonstrate opportunities for research involvement, such as engaging participants in refining experiment implementations, and learning opportunities, such as providing participants with possibilities to learn about research aims. We translate these findings into ideas for the design of future volunteer-based online experiment platforms that are more mutually beneficial to citizen scientists and researchers.

Identifying how visually impaired people explore raised-line diagrams to improve the design of touch interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025582,25,https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/18988/1/bardot_18988.pdf,"
Raised-line diagrams are widely used by visually impaired (VI) people to read maps, drawings or graphs. While previous work has identified general exploration strategies for raised-line drawings, we have limited knowledge on how this exploration is performed in detail and how it extends to other types of diagrams such as maps or graphs, frequently used in specialized schools. Such information can be crucial for the design of accessible interfaces on touchscreens. We conducted a study in which participants were asked to explore five types of raised-line diagrams (common drawings, perspective drawings, mathematical graphs, neighborhood maps, and geographical maps) while tracking both hands fingers. Relying on a first set of results, we proposed a set of design guidelines for touch interfaces.

In this note, we explore the effects of frequency distribution on average menu performance as well as individual item performance. We compare three frequency distributions of menu item usage: Uniform; Zipfian with s=1 and Zipfian with s=2. The results show that (1) user's behavior is sensitive to different frequency distributions at both menu and item level; (2) individual item selection time depends on, not only its frequency, but also the frequency of other items in the menu. Finally, we discuss how these findings might have impacts on menu design, empirical studies and menu modeling.

Increasing users' confidence in uncertain data by aggregating data from multiple sources,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025998,27,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p828.pdf,"
We often base our decisions on uncertain data - for instance, when consulting the weather forecast before deciding what to wear. Due to their uncertainty, such forecasts can differ by provider. To make an informed decision, many people compare several forecasts, which is a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To facilitate comparison, we identified three aggregation mechanisms for forecasts: manual comparison and two mechanisms of computational aggregation. In a survey, we compared the mechanisms using different representations. We then developed a weather application to evaluate the most promising candidates in a real-world study. Our results show that aggregation increases users' confidence in uncertain data, independent of the type of representation. Further, we find that for daily events, users prefer to use computationally aggregated forecasts. However, for high-stakes events, they prefer manual comparison. We discuss how our findings inform the design of improved interfaces for comparison of uncertain data, including non-weather purposes.

Narratives in crowdsourced evaluation of visualizations: A double-edged sword?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025870,27,https://inria.hal.science/hal-01448095/document,"
We explore the effects of providing task context when evaluating visualization tools using crowdsourcing. We gave crowdsource workers i) abstract information visualization tasks without any context, ii) tasks where we added semantics to the dataset, and iii) tasks with two types of backstory narratives: an analytic narrative and a decision-making narrative. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence that adding data semantics increases accuracy, and further found that our backstory narratives can even decrease accuracy. Adding dataset semantics can however increase attention and provide subjective benefits in terms of confidence, perceived easiness, task enjoyability and perceived usefulness of the visualization. Nevertheless, our backstory narratives did not appear to provide additional subjective benefits. These preliminary findings suggest that narratives may have complex and unanticipated effects, calling for more studies in this area.

Inspired by hand-weaving craft, WeaveMesh supports a highly customizable software platform, which is applicable for simulating and facilitating freeform surface constructions composed of woven lines arranged in a regular grid, which can serve as a guide for easy assembly. In addition, mobilizable connectors are suggested to support flexible assembly, which can be revised, recycled, and reused to facilitate short iterations. Furthermore, compared to common additive and subtractive techniques, WeaveMesh has a better balance between time and material saving.

Many finger sensing input devices now support proximity input, enabling users to perform in-air gestures. While near-surface interactions increase the input vocabulary, they lack tactile feedback, making it hard for users to perform gestures or to know when the interaction takes place. Sparkle stimulates the fingertip with touchable electric arcs above a hover sensing device to give users in-air tactile or thermal feedback, sharper and more feelable than acoustic mid-air haptic devices. We present the design of a high voltage resonant transformer with a low-loss soft ferrite core and self-tuning driver circuit, with which we create electric arcs 6 mm in length, and combine this technology with infrared proximity sensing in two proof-of-concept devices with form factor and functionality similar to a button and a touchpad. We provide design guidelines for Sparkle devices and examples of stimuli in application scenarios, and report the results of a user study on the perceived sensations. Sparkle is the first step towards providing a new type of hover feedback, and it does not require users to wear tactile stimulators.

Handheld Perspective Corrected Displays (HPCDs) can create the feeling of holding a virtual 3D object. They offer a direct interaction that is isomorphic to the manipulation of physical objects. This illusion depends on the ability to provide a natural visuomotor coupling. High performances systems are thus required to evaluate the fundamental merits of HPCDs. We built a spherical HPCD using external projection. The system offers a lightweight wireless seamless display with head-coupled stereo, robust tracking, and low latency. We compared users' performances with this HPCD and two other interactions that used a fixed planar display and either a touchpad or the spherical display as an indirect input. The task involved the inspection of complex virtual 3D puzzles. Physical puzzles were also tested as references. Contrary to expectations, all virtual interactions were found to be more efficient than a more ""natural"" physical puzzle. The HPCD yielded lower performances than the touchpad. This study indicates that the object examination task did not benefit from the accurate and precise rotations offered by the HPCD, but benefited from the high C/D gain of the touchpad.

The research team adapted participatory design techniques to work with five such women, and their families, to design and evaluate new assistive technology for these women. The process suggests a class of media-playing devices that would be generally useful to women with Rett syndrome: systems that can load multiple audio or video segments; be activated by many different switches; and respond instantly to switch-hits. As well, the systems should permit a caregiver to set the start and end time of each segment, and how the system advances through a sequence of segments. The paper also discusses patterns that were observed when collaborating with the families. For example, parents shared longstanding but untried ideas for new assistive technology; and expressed a strong interest in any device that would help their daughters do things for themselves.

Tactile drones-providing immersive tactile feedback in virtual reality through quadcopters,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3050426,91,,"
Head-mounted displays for virtual reality (VR) provide high-fidelity visual and auditory experiences. Other modalities are currently less supported. Current commercial devices typically deliver tactile feedback through controllers the user holds in the hands. Since both hands get occupied and tactile feedback can only be provided at a single position, research and industry proposed a range of approaches to provide richer tactile feedback. Approaches, such as tactile vests or electrical muscle stimulation, were proposed, but require additional body-worn devices. This limits comfort and restricts provided feedback to specific body parts. With this Interactivity installation, we propose quadcopters to provide tactile stimulation in VR.

Informality and invisibility: Traditional technologies as tools for collaboration in an informal market,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025643,25,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p4765.pdf,"
This paper explores how actors in local markets in the Global South adapt traditional communication technologies to successfully collaborate to sustain the markets and their business practices. Drawing on ethnographic observations at a local technology goods market in Bangalore, India, the study details the use of a landline telephone intercom system as the primary tool for business communication in the market. Through analyzing how the intercom system relates to informality and physical space, the paper argues that it bridges the formal with the informal, and helps facilitate informal business practices while also allowing them to remain hidden from the formal regulatory gaze of the state.

Suggesting api usage to novice programmers with the example guru,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025827,26,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025827,"
Programmers, especially novices, often have difficulty learning new APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Existing research has not fully addressed novice programmers' unawareness of all available API methods. To help novices discover new and appropriate uses for API methods, we designed a system called the Example Guru. The Example Guru suggests context-relevant API methods based on each programmer's code. The suggestions provide contrasting examples to demonstrate how to use the API methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Example Guru, we ran a study comparing novice programmers' use of the Example Guru and documentation-inspired API information. We found that twice as many participants accessed the Example Guru suggestions compared to documentation and that participants used more than twice as many new API methods after accessing suggestions than documentation.

From a large social media account containing more than 30 million interactions from users from 181 countries engaging with more than 4,200 digital products produced by a global media corporation, we demonstrate that our methodology can first identify both distinct and impactful user segments and then create persona descriptions by automatically adding pertinent features, such as names, photos, and personal attributes. We validate our approach by implementing the methodology into an actual working system that leverages large scale online user data for generation of persona descriptions. We present the overall methodological approach, data analysis process, and system development. Findings show this method can develop believable personas representing real groups of people using real-time online user data.

In this paper we present Videos of Things: videos that portray the mediated, lived world of computational artifacts informed by postphenomenology. In a post-phenomenological understanding, things and us are interdependent in that they mutually shape each other. And as a whole, technology or designed things mediate the relations between our world and us. This can be a challenge for designers. Through the making of design videos, we explored narrative strategies for creating stories featuring technological mediation. These include humanness, patterns in time, and non-human ensembles. We reflect on how the videos at different stages of the design process have helped to a) speculate on technological mediated relationships, b) synthesize and reflect on qualitative data on technological mediation and c) anticipate technological mediation. The paper contributes different narrative strategies for design videos and the role these videos can play within a design process aimed at elaborating the mediated qualities of technologies.

It helps developers to handle uncertain input and implement feedback and GUI adaptations. ProbUI replaces today's static target models (bounding boxes) with probabilistic gestures (""bounding behaviours""). It is the first touch GUI framework to unite concepts from three areas of related work: 1) Developers declaratively define touch behaviours for GUI targets. As a key insight, the declarations imply simple probabilistic models (HMMs with 2D Gaussian emissions). 2) ProbUI derives these models automatically to evaluate users' touch sequences. 3) It then infers intended behaviour and target. Developers bind callbacks to gesture progress, completion, and other conditions. We show ProbUI's value by implementing existing and novel widgets, and report developer feedback from a survey and a lab study.

A long-standing challenge in video-mediated communication systems is to represent a remote participant's gaze direction in local environments correctly. To address this issue, we developed ThirdEye, an add-on eye-display for a video communication system. This display is made from an artificial ulexite (TV rock) that is cut into a hemispherical shape, enabling light from the bottom surface to be projected onto the hemisphere surface. By drawing an appropriate ellipse on an LCD and placing ThirdEye over it, this system simulates an eyeball. Our experiment proved that an observer could perceive a remote Looker's gaze direction more precisely when the gaze was presented using ThirdEye compared to the case in which the gaze was presented using the Looker's face on a flat display.

Quantifying aversion to costly typing errors in expert mobile text entry,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025695,23,,"
Text entry is an increasingly important activity for mobile device users. As a result, increasing text entry speed of expert typists is an important design goal for physical and soft keyboards. Mathematical models that predict text entry speed can help with keyboard design and optimization. Making typing errors when entering text is inevitable. However, current models do not consider how typists themselves reduce the risk of making typing errors (and lower error frequency) by typing more slowly. We demonstrate that users respond to costly typing errors by reducing their typing speed to minimize typing errors. We present a model that estimates the effects of risk aversion to errors on typing speed. We estimate the magnitude of this speed change, and show that disregarding the adjustments to typing speed that expert typists use to reduce typing errors leads to overly optimistic estimates of maximum errorless expert typing speeds.

In face-to-face interaction, moving with and mimicking the body movements of communication partners has been widely demonstrated to affect interpersonal processes, including feel- ings of affiliation and closeness. In this paper, we examine effects of movement and mimicry in robot-mediated communication. Participants were instructed to get to know their partner, a confederate, who interacted with them via a telepresence robot. The robot either (a) mimicked the participant's body orientation (mimicry condition), (b) mimicked pre-recorded movements of another participant (random movement condition), or (c) did not move during the interaction (static condition). Results showed that mimicry and random movement had similar effects on participants' perceptions of similarity and closeness to their partners and that these effects depend on the participant's gender and level of self-monitoring. The findings suggest that the social movements of a telepresence robot affect interpersonal processes and that these effects are shaped by individual differences.

Challenge is arguably the most important experience that players seek in digital games. However, without a measure of how challenged players feel during the act of play, it is hard to design games that are neither too easy nor too hard and, therefore, truly enjoyable. Especially in industry, challenge is dominantly assessed by means of manual play testing in ad-hoc trials. The aim of this research is to create a more systematic, complete, and reliable instrument to evaluate the level of players' experienced challenge in games in the form of a questionnaire. This paper presents the key results from an extensive literature survey which will inform further development. We survey definitions of challenge, challenge types, and their relation to player experience based on the observations of game designers. We furthermore draw from empirical findings in a diverse range of fields such as game studies, human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI).

While many popular casual games use three-star systems, which give players up to three stars based on their performance in a level, this technique has seen limited application in human computation games (HCGs). This gives rise to the question of what impact, if any, a three-star system will have on the behavior of players in HCGs. In this work, we examined the impact of a three-star system implemented in the protein folding HCG Foldit. We compared the basic game's introductory levels with two versions using a three-star system, where players were rewarded with more stars for completing levels in fewer moves. In one version, players could continue playing levels for as many moves as they liked, and in the other, players were forced to reset the level if they used more moves than required to achieve at least one star on the level. We observed that the three-star system encouraged players to use fewer moves, take more time per move, and replay completed levels more often. We did not observe an impact on retention. This indicates that three-star systems may be useful for re-enforcing concepts introduced by HCG levels, or as a flexible means to encourage desired behaviors.

Test sets play an essential role in evaluating text entry techniques. In this paper, we argue that in addition to the widely adopted metric of bigram representativeness and memorability, word clarity should also be considered as a metric when creating test sets from the target dataset. Word clarity quantifies the extent to which a word is likely to confuse with other words on a keyboard. We formally define word clarity, derive equations calculating it, and both theoretically and empirically show that word clarity has a significant effect on text entry performance: it can yield up to 26.4% difference in error rate, and 25% difference in input speed. We later propose a Pareto optimization method for sampling test sets with different sizes, which optimizes the word clarity and bigram representativeness, and memorability of the test set. The obtained test sets are published on the Internet.

Programming and computational thinking skills are promoted in schools worldwide. However, there is still a lack of tools that assist learners and educators in the assessment of these skills. We have implemented an assessment tool, called Dr. Scratch, that analyzes Scratch projects with the aim to assess the level of development of several aspects of computational thinking. One of the issues to address in order to show its validity is to compare the (automatic) evaluations provided by the tool with the (manual) evaluations by (human) experts. In this paper we compare the assessments provided by Dr. Scratch with over 450 evaluations of Scratch projects given by 16 experts in computer science education. Our results show strong correlations between automatic and manual evaluations. As there is an ample debate among educators on the use of this type of tools, we discuss the implications and limitations, and provide recommendations for further research.

In this paper, we examine the articulation work surrounding the deployment of systems that have found limited long-term adoption: assistive technology. Specifically, we examine three research deployments of a collaborative game for children with autism. Analysis of the articulation work performed during these studies demonstrates how research deployments of technologies create conditions in which stakeholders must take on additional roles to make the deployment work. By understanding the articulation work surrounding deployment studies engendered in this role fluidity, we can improve both research design and the analysis of data emergent from these studies.

A common security practice used to deal with a password breach is locking user accounts and sending out an email to tell users that they need to reset their password to unlock their account. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of this security practice based on the password reset email that LinkedIn sent out around May 2016, and through an online survey conducted on 249 LinkedIn users who received that email. Our evaluation shows that only about 46% of the participants reset their passwords. The mean time taken to reset password was 26.3 days, revealing that a significant proportion of the participants reset their password a few weeks, or even months after first receiving the email. Our findings suggest that more effective persuasive measures need to be added to convince users to reset their password in a timely manner, and further reduce the risks associated with delaying password resets.

Currently, virtual (i.e. touchscreen) controls are dynamic, but lack the advantageous tactile feedback of physical controls. Similarly, devices may also have dedicated physical controls, but they lack the flexibility to adapt for different contexts and applications. On mobile and wearable devices in particular, space constraints further limit our input and output capabilities. We propose utilizing reconfigurable tactile elements around the edge of a mobile device to enable dynamic physical controls and feedback. These tactile elements can be used for physical touch input and output, and can reposition according to the application both around the edge of and hidden within the device. We present shiftIO, two implementations of such a system which actuate physical controls around the edge of a mobile device using magnetic locomotion. One version utilizes PCB-manufactured electromagnetic coils, and the other uses switchable permanent magnets. We perform a technical evaluation of these prototypes and compare their advantages in various applications. Finally, we demonstrate several mobile applications which leverage shiftIO to create novel mobile interactions.

This paper introduces BrightBeat, a set of seamless visual and auditory interventions that look like respiratory biofeedback, rhythmically oscillating, but that are tuned to appear with a slower speed, with the aim of slowing a stressed computer user's breathing and, consequently, bringing a sense of focus and calmness. These interventions were designed to run easily on commonplace personal electronic devices and to not require any focused attention in order to be effective. We have run a randomized placebo-controlled trial and examined both objective and subjective measures of impact with N=32 users undergoing work tasks. BrightBeat significantly influenced slower breathing, had a lasting effect, improved self-reported calmness and focus, and was highly preferred for future use.

As demand for design education increases, instructors are struggling to provide timely, personalized feedback for student projects.

We report on a study in which students (n=127) created early- and late-stage prototypes as part of nine-week projects. At each stage, students received feedback from peers and external crowds: their own social networks, online communities, and a task market. We measured the quality, quantity and valence of the feedback and the actions taken on it, and categorized its content using a taxonomy of critique discourse. The study found that peers produced feedback that was of higher perceived quality, acted upon more, and longer compared to the crowds. However, crowd feedback was found to be a viable supplement to peer feedback and students preferred it for projects targeting specialized audiences. Feedback from all sources spanned only a subset of the critique categories. Instructors may fill this gap by further scaffolding feedback generation.

Fair chase posits, for example, that hunters must not have an improper advantage over animals. The actual practices of hunters in different communities (e.g., communities revolving around different weapons or professions), however, reveals a series of opposing points of view among hunters at large on what actually constitutes fair chase. We suggest that an understanding of fair chase and its dialectics can constructively problematize nature for human-computer interaction.

This paper presents the results of a 36 participant empirical comparison of touch mode-switching. Six techniques are evaluated, spanning current and future techniques: long press, non-dominant hand, two-fingers, hard press, knuckle, and thumb-on-finger. Two poses are controlled for, seated with the tablet on a desk and standing with the tablet held on the forearm. Findings indicate pose has no effect on mode switching time and little effect on error rate; using two-fingers is fastest while long press is much slower; non-preferred hand and thumb-on-finger also rate highly in subjective scores. The experiment protocol is based on Li et al.'s pen mode-switching study, enabling a comparison of touch and pen mode switching.

How human am I? EEG-based evaluation of virtual characters,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026043,22,https://download.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/media/FB20/GCC/paper/mustafa2017how.pdf,"
There is a continuous effort by animation experts to create increasingly realistic and more human-like digital characters. However, as virtual characters become more human they risk evoking a sense of unease in their audience. This sensation, called the Uncanny Valley effect, is widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research but empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In this paper, we investigate the neural responses to computer-generated faces in a cognitive neuroscience study. We record brain activity from participants (N = 40)} using electroencephalography (EEG) while they watch videos of real humans and computer-generated virtual characters. Our results show distinct differences in neural responses for highly realistic computer-generated faces such as Digital Emily compared with real humans. These differences are unique only to agents that are highly photorealistic, i.e. the `uncanny' response. Based on these specific neural correlates we train a support vector machine~(SVM) to measure the probability of an uncanny response for any given computer-generated character from EEG data. This allows the ordering of animated characters based on their level of `uncanniness'.

Vita: Towards supporting volunteer interactions with long-term care residents with dementia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025776,21,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p6195.pdf,"
Volunteers are an important resource at long-term care homes because they can supply services, such as engagement activities, that over-burdened care staff struggle to provide. However, volunteers without sufficient training are often challenged in responding to dementia-linked behaviors, which can lead to frustrating difficulties during interaction. Additionally, short-staffed care homes have difficulties in training and maintaining volunteers. To better support volunteers in providing engagement activities for people with dementia without a high training burden, we created VITA, a tablet-based system that supplies carefully designed profiling and guidance using our dementia-appropriate engagement activity kit. Our evaluation indicated that the instructional guide supplied by VITA significantly improves volunteers' ability to facilitate engagement activities with people with dementia, approaching the level of engagement achievable by professional therapists.

Testing incremental difficulty design in platformer games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025697,22,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p5109.pdf,"
Designing difficulty levels in platformer games is a challenge for game designers. It is important because design decisions that affect difficulty also directly affect player experience. Consequently, design strategies for balancing game difficulty are discussed by both academics and game designers. In this paper, we study how manipulating the following design decisions, commonly found in platformers, moderates difficulty: Scroll Speed, Target Size, Jump Task Complexity, and Perspective. Results for Scroll Speed and Target Size indicate that errors increase as speed increases and platform size decreases. However, results for jump task complexity demonstrate a separation of errors from task complexity. Specifically, while double-jump tasks are harder than single-jump tasks, triple-jump tasks appear to be as difficult as double-jump tasks. Additionally, the study demonstrates how changes in perspective affect the errors made by players in gameplay. The study results are applicable both to automatic level generation and dynamic difficulty adjustment in platformer games.

Was I there? Impact of platform and headphones on 360 video immersion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053225,72,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1542481/1/CHI%20LBW%20FINAL%20V2.pdf,"
Virtual reality industries claim that 360 videos are a powerful tool for creating empathy because they are an immersive medium, and wearing headphones is encouraged for the full immersive experience. To investigate these claims, we carried out a 2x2 between subjects lab study (n=40) to explore whether 360 viewing platform (magic window / google cardboard) and headphone use (with / without) have an effect on Film-Immersion for the 360 video Fire Rescue. Our results reveal a significant interaction effect: headphones increased immersion for google cardboard, but decreased immersion for magic window. However, not all dimensions of the immersive experience were affected. This suggests that head-mounted displays increase presence, but do not necessarily lead to more empathy and greater interest in the 360 video. Thematic analysis of interview data suggests contributing factors such as fear of missing out (FOMO). These findings have implications for film makers and researchers of 360 videos.

Cosmetic items do not provide functional advantages in games, but, nevertheless, they play an important role in the overall player experience. Possessing predominantly socially-constructed dimensions of value, cosmetic items are chosen, discussed, assessed, and valuated in an ongoing iterative collaborative process by communities of players. In our study, we explore the case of Dota 2 and apply Topic Modeling to community-discussions data gathered from Reddit.com. We describe social experiences related to the valuation of cosmetic items in interaction and collision of various logics, including artificial scarcity, decomposition of visual effects, and connectedness to the game lore. Our findings connect the collective experience of players in the game and on online community platforms, suggesting that non-utility-based social value construction becomes an important part of game experience.

In recent years, around device input has emerged as a complement to standard touch input, albeit in limited tasks and contexts, such as for item selection or map navigation. We push the boundaries for around device interactions to facilitate an entire smartphone application: browsing through large information lists to make a decision. To this end, we present AirPanes, a novel technique that allows two-handed in-air interactions, conjointly with touch input to perform analytic tasks, such as making a purchase decision. AirPanes resolves the inefficiencies of having to switch between multiple views or panes in common smartphone applications. We explore the design factors that make AirPanes efficient. In a controlled study, we find that AirPanes is on average 50% more efficient that standard touch input for an analytic task. We offer recommendations for implementing AirPanes in a broad range of applications.

From Siri to Alexa to Cortana, conversational interfaces are hitting the mainstream and becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, user experiences with such applications remain disappointing. Although it is easy to get a system to produce words, none of the current agents or bots display general conversational competence. Modeling natural conversation is still a hard problem. But in order to tackle it, conversational UX designers must possess a technical understanding of the structures of natural conversation. This workshop explores the intersection of user interface design and the design of natural conversation. It seeks to outline principles and guidelines for Conversational UX Design as a distinct discipline. Workshop participants will get their hands dirty building conversation flows.

Widespread rumoring can hinder attempts to make sense of what is going on during disaster scenarios. Understanding how and why rumors spread in these contexts could assist in the design of systems that facilitate timely and accurate sensemaking. We address a basic question in this line: To what extent does rumor evolution occur (1) through reliance on a centralized information source, (2) in parallel information silos, or (3) through a web of complex informational interactions? We develop a conceptual model and associated analysis algorithms that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. We analyze a case of rumoring on Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. We find that rumor spreading was predominantly a parallel process in this case, which is consistent with a hypothesis that information silos may underlie the persistence of false rumors. Special attention towards detecting and resolving parallel information threads during collective sensemaking may hence be warranted.

Many health care providers, with a variety of trainings, counsel clients on quitting smoking on a day-to-day basis. In their clinical practice, they draw from and adapt guidelines and research-based strategies to fit individual client situations and challenges. Designers of technologies to support quitting smoking can learn from these real world practices to create tools that better adapt to individual differences. We present findings from interviews with 28 providers with diverse experiences in smoking cessation counselling. Through analysis of their individualization strategies, challenges, and perceptions of technology, we find that providers: (1) individualize context appropriate coping strategies by involving clients in brainstorming, (2) emphasize the need to support nicotine withdrawal in clients, (3) mitigate social triggers and mediate social support for clients, and (4) need to navigate dependencies with other providers for managing medications and comorbid health conditions of clients. With this empirical understanding, we extend the discussion on the design of technology to support quitting smoking, highlight current barriers to individualization, and suggest future opportunities to address these barriers.

To begin to solve this problem, we describe a small suite of accessible techniques that we collectively refer to as the Jackknife gesture recognizer. Our dynamic time warping based approach for both segmented and continuous data is designed to be a robust, go-to method for gesture recognition across a variety of modalities using only limited training samples. We evaluate pen and touch, Wii Remote, Kinect, Leap Motion, and sound-sensed gesture datasets as well as conduct tests with continuous data. Across all scenarios we show that our approach is able to achieve high accuracy, suggesting that Jackknife is a capable recognizer and good first choice for many endeavors.

We investigate two settings: in Follow-Remote, the position of the video window follows the position of the remote user; in Follow-Local, the video window always appears in front of the local user. We report the results of a controlled experiment showing that with Follow-Remote, participants are faster, use more deictic instructions, interpret them more accurately, and use fewer words. However, some participants preferred the virtual face-to-face created by Follow-Local when checking for their partners' understanding. We conclude with design recommendations to support remote collaboration across wall-sized displays.

Research on sexism in digital games has suggested that women self-select out of playing sexist games; however, assuming a homogenous gender-based response does not account for the diversity of identities within a gender group. Gender-incongruent responses to recent events like #gamergate implies that the gender of the participant is not paramount to experience, but that their beliefs about gender roles are. To explore the role of sexist beliefs on experience in sexist games, we created three versions of a game that were identical except for the presence of sexist imagery and/or dialogue. We show that enjoyment of sexist games is not predicted by player gender, but by the player's pre-existing beliefs about gender. Furthermore, avatar identification is the pathway through which enjoyment is facilitated. Finally, sexist dialogue does not improve the play experience for anyone rather it harms experience for players of all genders who do not hold sexist beliefs.

The steering law models human motor performance and has been verified to hold for a single linear and/or circular path. Some extensions investigated steering around corners. Yet, little is known about human performance in navigating joined linear paths, i.e., successions of path segments with different widths. Such operations appear in graphical user interface tasks, including lasso operations in illustration software. In this work, we conducted several experiments involving joined paths. The results show that users significantly changed their behavior, and that this strategy change can be predicted beforehand. A simple model summing the two indexes of difficulty (IDs) for each path predicts movement time well, but more sophisticated models were also evaluated. The best model in terms of both of R2 and AIC values includes the ID of the crossing operation to enter the second path.

In recent years VR devices have become affordable and are applied already in some driving studies. It has not been shown whether driving simulations can use VR to increase immersion in low-cost setups. We conducted a pilot study with 20 participants using a racing game as simulation software. The results of this pilot study indicate that using a VR headset can potentially dissociate participants to a higher degree from the real world compared to the use of flat screens. However, participants felt a higher discomfort using the VR HMD.

Smartphone reminding apps can compensate for memory impairment after acquired brain injury (ABI). In the absence of a caregiver, users must enter reminders themselves if the apps are going to help them. Poor memory and apathy associated with ABI can result in failure to initiate such configuration behaviour and the benefits of reminder apps are lost. ForgetMeNot takes a novel approach to address this problem by periodically encouraging the user to enter reminders with unsolicited prompts (UPs). An in situ case study investigated the experience of using a reminding app for people with ABI and tested UPs as a potential solution to initiating reminder entry. Three people with severe ABI living in a post-acute rehabilitation hospital used the app in their everyday lives for four weeks to collect real usage data. Field observations illustrated how difficulties with motivation, insight into memory difficulties and anxiety impact reminder app use in a rehabilitation setting. Results showed that when 6 UPs were presented throughout the day, reminder-setting increased, showing UPs are an important addition to reminder applications for people with ABI. This study demonstrates that barriers to technology use can be resolved in practice when software is developed with an understanding of the issues experienced by the user group.

Haptic interfaces are ideal in situations where visual/auditory attention is impossible, unsafe, or socially unacceptable. However, conventional (vibrotactile) wearable interfaces often possess a limited bandwidth for expressing information. We explore a novel form of tactile stimulation through brushing, and demonstrate BrushTouch, a wearable prototype for brushing haptics. We also present schemes for conveying information such as time and direction through multi-tactor wrist-worn haptic interfaces. To evaluate BrushTouch, two user studies were run, comparing it to a conventional vibrotactile wristband across a number of tasks in both lab and mobile conditions. We show that for certain cues brushing can be more accurately recognized than vibration, enabling more effective spatial schemes for presenting information through haptic means. We then show that BrushTouch is capable of greater information transfer using such cues. We believe that brushing, as with other non-vibrotactile haptic techniques, merits further investigation as potential vehicles for richer haptic feedback.

Utilizing experience goals in design of industrial systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025620,21,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p6993.pdf,"
The core idea of experience-driven design is to define the intended experience before functionality and technology. This is a radical idea for companies that have built their competences around specific technologies. Although many technology companies are willing to shift their focus towards experience-driven design, reports on real-life cases about the utilization of this design approach are rare. As part of an industry-led research program, we introduced experience-driven design to metal industry companies with experience goals as the key technique. Four design cases in three companies showed that the goals are useful in keeping the focus on user experience, but several challenges are still left for future research to tackle. This exploratory research lays ground for future research by providing initial criteria for assessing experience design tools. The results shed light on utilizing experience goals in industrial design projects and help practitioners in planning and managing the product design process with user experience in mind.

tactoRing: a skin-drag discrete display,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025703,26,https://makinteract.kaist.ac.kr/files/2017/Je_tactoRing_CHI17.pdf,"
Smart rings are an emerging wearable technology particularly suitable for discrete notifications based on haptic cues. Previous work mostly focused on tactile actuators that stimulate only specific skin receptors on the finger, resulting in limited information expressiveness. We propose tactoRing, a novel tactile display that, by dragging a small tactor on the skin around the finger, excites multiple skin areas resulting in more accurate cue recognition. In this paper, we present the hardware and a perception study to understand the ability of users to recognize eight distinct points around the finger. Moreover, we show two different techniques to encode information through skin-dragging motion with accuracy up to 94%. We finally showcase a set of applications that, by combining sequences of tactile stimuli, achieve higher expressiveness than prior methods.

Localized haptic texture: A rendering technique based on taxels for high density tactile feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026010,22,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p5006.pdf,"
We investigate the relevance of surface haptic rendering techniques for tactile devices. We focus on the two major existing techniques and show that they have complementary benefits. The first one, called textsc{S}urface textsc{H}aptic textsc{O}bject (textsc{SHO}), which is based on finger position, is shown to be more suitable to render sparse textures; while the second one, called textsc{S}urface textsc{H}aptic textsc{T}exture (textsc{SHT}), which is based on finger velocity, is shown to be more suitable for dense textures and fast finger movements. We hence propose a new rendering technique, called textsc{L}ocalized textsc{H}aptic textsc{T}exture (textsc{LHT}), which is based on the concept of textit{taxel} considered as an elementary tactile information that is rendered on the screen. By using a grid of taxels to encode a texture, textsc{LHT} is shown to provide a consistent tactile rendering across different velocities for high density textures, and is found to reduce user textit{error rate} by up to 77.68% compared to textsc{SHO}.

The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) onto public roads presents both technical and social challenges. Public understanding and acceptance of AVs requires engagement with people who live in, work at or visit cities where they are deployed on public road networks. We investigate the impact of one of the first placements of AV passenger transport on public roadways: the Sion ""SmartShuttle"". This late-breaking research presents preliminary results from interviews with local shopkeepers, residents, pedestrians and drivers to understand their attitudes and opinions of the shuttle. We also discuss video-based fieldwork that demonstrates how drivers negotiate next moves with one another through their windscreens using embodied signals such as gestures, lip-reading, and head nods to coordinate and manage a traffic situation. Finally, we consider the implications for how fully autonomous vehicles might be designed to take into account the subtle negotiations that road users engage in to coordinate with one another.

Many students underperform on exams due to experiencing high test anxiety. We report on a study comparing a novel intervention of seeking support from one's social network to the more common approaches of expressive writing and studying task-relevant materials for simulated open-ended test questions. We measured in-the-moment (state) anxiety before and after each intervention, and correctness of the solutions. We also surveyed students to learn about their perceptions of the interventions. Our results showed that social support decreased the anxiety of high test-anxious students by 21% with the reduction in anxiety correlating with the number of messages received. Social support also allowed high test-anxious students to score at the level of low test-anxious students. Expressive writing showed a similar effect, but increased the anxiety of low test-anxious students by 61%. Studying task materials had no effect on anxiety and high test-anxious students performed worse than low test-anxious students. Despite benefiting from social support, we found that students were uncomfortable soliciting support from their online social network. Realizing the benefits of this approach may therefore require different formulations of social support in practice.

We present results from a study with 847 participants in an online Japanese-language assessment tool demonstrating that our framework can efficiently measure student ability and predict student performance on specific problems. We also present results from analysis of curricula showing that the progressions of two different textbooks are surprisingly similar, and that our framework can lead to the discovery of general principles of expert progression design. Finally, we demonstrate automatic progression generation with desired sequencing and pacing, allowing for tailoring of progressions and mapping of parameters extracted from one curriculum onto another.

Time-consuming and complicated best describe the current state of the Information Extraction (IE) field. Machine learning approaches to IE require large collections of labeled datasets that are difficult to create and use obscure mathematical models, occasionally returning unwanted results that are unexplainable. Rule-based approaches, while resulting in easy-to-understand IE rules, are still time-consuming and labor-intensive. SEER combines the best of these two approaches: a learning model for IE rules based on a small number of user-specified examples. In this paper, we explain the design behind SEER and present a user study comparing our system against a commercially available tool in which users create IE rules manually. Our results show that SEER helps users complete text extraction tasks more quickly, as well as more accurately.

The invisible nature of VUIs has been attributed to challenging discoverability with VUIs. Low discoverability often leads to learnability issues. Researchers have designed visual tools for VUIs to help users learn as they go. However, few have used adaptation to ensure that learnability with the help of these tools extends beyond initial use. We designed DiscoverCal, a calendar application designed using adaptive discovery tools to improve learnability in VUIs. In this paper, we identify key characteristics of existing discovery tools.

In study one, we tested discrete gestures using three simple games. We categorized the control schemes as binary (button only), action, and navigation, the latter two named based on the game mechanics mapped to the gestures. We found that the binary scheme performed the best, but gesture-based control schemes are stimulating and appealing. Results also suggest that the deformation gestures are best mapped to simple and natural tasks. In study two, we tested continuous gestures in a 3D racing game using the same control scheme categorization. Results were mostly consistent with study one but showed an improvement in performance and preference for the action control scheme.

Empirical analysis of the subjective impressions and objective measures of domain scientists' visual analytic judgments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025882,20,https://aedeegee.github.io/chi17.pdf,"
Scientists often use specific data analysis and presentation methods familiar within their domain. But does high familiarity drive better analytical judgment? This question is especially relevant when familiar methods themselves can have shortcomings: many visualizations used conventionally for scientific data analysis and presentation do not follow established best practices. This necessitates new methods that might be unfamiliar yet prove to be more effective. But there is little empirical understanding of the relationships between scientists' subjective impressions about familiar and unfamiliar visualizations and objective measures of their visual analytic judgments. To address this gap and to study these factors, we focus on visualizations used for comparison of climate model performance. We report on a comprehensive survey-based user study with 47 climate scientists and present an analysis of: i) relationships among scientists' familiarity, their perceived levels of comfort, confidence, accuracy, and objective measures of accuracy, and ii) relationships among domain experience, visualization familiarity, and post-study preference.

We present the design and evaluation of pressure-based interactive control of 3D navigation precision. Specifically, we examine the control of gain factors in tangible 3D interactions using locally-coupled mobile devices. By focusing on pressure as a separate input channel we can adjust gain factors independently from other input modalities used in 3D navigation, in particular for the exploration of 3D visualisations. We present two experiments. First, we determined that people strongly preferred higher pressures to be mapped to higher gain factors. Using this mapping, we compared pressure with rate control, velocity control, and slider-based control in a second study. Our results show that pressure-based gain control allows people to be more precise in the same amount of time compared to established input modalities. Pressure-based control was also clearly preferred by our participants. In summary, we demonstrate that pressure facilitates effective and efficient precision control for mobile 3D navigation.

Analyzing these visions as design fictions, we argue that they help cultivate unrealistic anticipatory relationships to the present and entail concomitantly unrealistic imperatives for the philanthropic sector.

The ubiquity of internet-based nutrition information sharing indicates an opportunity to use social computing platforms to promote nutrition literacy and healthy nutritional choices. We conducted a series of experiments with unpaid volunteers using an online Nutrition Knowledge Test. The test asked participants to examine pairs of photographed meals and identify meals higher in a specific macronutrient (e.g., carbohydrate). After each answer, participants received no feedback on the accuracy of their answers, viewed proportions of peers choosing each response, received correctness feedback from an expert dietitian with or without expert-generated explanations, or received correctness feedback with crowd-generated explanations. The results showed that neither viewing peer responses nor correctness feedback alone improved learning. However, correctness feedback with explanations (i.e., modeling) led to significant learning gains, with no significant difference between explanations generated by experts or peers. This suggests the importance of explanations in social computing-based casual learning about nutrition and the potential for scaling this approach via crowdsourcing.

On the other hand, automatic approaches allow users to generate a result by setting a few global parameters. However, global settings often leave too much detail/complexity in some parts of the image while missing important details in others. We propose interactive vectorization tools that offer more local control than automatic systems, but are more powerful and high-level than simple curve editing. Our system enables novices to vectorize images significantly faster than even experts with state-of-the-art tools.

Severe itching conditions such as eczema or atopic dermatitis can have a significant impact on one's quality of life. Unfortunately, many of these conditions cannot be cured, and the focus is often on properly controlling or managing the condition. Thus, it is important to understand or objectively monitor how one's scratching behavior changes, based on medication or treatment or environmental conditions. In this work, we explore how wearable devices can support people with itching conditions to better manage their conditions. We carried out a three-phase study with 40 participants and 2 dermatologists to understand the implications of various system features and designs. Based on interviews with patients and doctors, we incorporated medical guidelines for treatment and patients' needs in the proposed Itchtector - a smartwatch-based mobile system to monitor itching behaviors and provide objective information about the user's scratching behaviors.

Second, the use of this data to generate expressive avatars which we refer to as Emotional Beasts. The creation of Emotional Beasts will allow us to experiment with the manipulation of a user's self-expression in VR space and as well as the perception of others in it, providing some valuable tools to evoke a desired emotional reaction. As this medium moves forward, this and other tools are what will help the field of virtual reality expand from a medium of surface-level experience to one of deep, emotionally compelling human-to-human connection.

Foraging among similar variants of the same artifact is a common activity, but computational models of Information Foraging Theory (IFT) have not been developed to take such variants into account. Without being able to computationally predict people's foraging behavior with variants, our ability to harness the theory in practical ways--such as building and systematically assessing tools for people who forage different variants of an artifact--is limited. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new predictive model, PFIS-V, that builds upon PFIS3, the most recent of the PFIS family of modeling IFT in programming situations. Our empirical results show that PFIS-V is up to 25% more accurate than PFIS3 in predicting where a forager will navigate in a variationed information space.

To showcase the relevance and usefulness of our method, we collected gestures from people without visual impairments and successfully synthesized gestures with the articulation characteristics of people with visual impairments. We also show that gesture recognition accuracy improves significantly when using our synthetic gesture samples for training. Our contributions will benefit researchers and practitioners that wish to design gesture user interfaces for people with various abilities by helping them prototype, evaluate, and predict gesture recognition performance without having to expressly recruit and involve people with disabilities in long, time-consuming gesture collection experiments.

Gender norms and attitudes about childcare activities presented on father blogs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025767,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025767,"
Father involvement is important for child well-being. However, fathers still do significantly less childcare than mothers, due in part to traditional gender norms. This research investigates whether incorporating do-it-yourself (DIY) language and imagery into parenting blogs is an effective mechanism for boosting fathers' willingness to perform childcare activities. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 374 participants in the U.S. who responded to ten parenting blog posts. Subjects were randomized to view posts with either DIY or neutral language and either routine childcare activities (e.g., changing diapers) or interactive ones (e.g., finger painting). Results show that DIY language actually decreases a father's willingness to do a childcare activity. Further, fathers underestimate how socially appropriate it is for them to perform childcare activities and this misperception relates to their willingness to get involved. We draw on social norms literature to recommend next steps for designing interfaces to support father involvement in childrearing.

Enhancing pen-based interaction using electrovibration and vibration haptic feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025555,17,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p3746.pdf,"
This paper presents the EV2-Pen which leverages electrovibration technology and vibration technology in pen interaction. Electrovibration technology can produce multisensory feedback when the pen is in motion (sliding/moving on the screen), and vibration technology can provide vibrative feedback when the pen is stationary (pointing/resting on the screen). We conducted an experiment to investigate user performance with the EV2-Pen. The results indicated that the EV2-Pen outperformed the EV-Pen [18, 19] in pointing-steering tasks. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of the EV2-Pen, and explore some possible applications and scenarios.

Can i think of something else when using a BCI? Cognitive demand of an SSVEP-based BCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026037,17,https://inria.hal.science/hal-01625088/file/pre-print.pdf,"
BCIs are presumably supposed to require the full attention of their users and to lose accuracy if they pay attention to another task. This assertion has been verified with several BCI paradigms (e.g. P300). But the cognitive demand of the promising SSVEP paradigm had never been specifically assessed yet. We measured the accuracy of an SSVEP-based BCI used by 26 participants in various conditions of mental workload. Our analysis revealed that surprisingly, for this type of BCI, little attention is actually needed from participants to reach optimal accuracy: participants were able to successfully perform a complex secondary task (N-back) without degrading the BCI accuracy. The same observation was made whether visual or auditive attention was solicited. These results indicate that SSVEP is a low-demanding paradigm in terms of cognitive resources, and are encouraging for its use in complex interaction settings.

These types of explanations have been used in other recommendation and intelligent systems as a means of promoting user understanding and acceptance. Our findings show that the ""News Feed"" FYI' blog posts focus more on explanations that justify why the algorithm works the way it does, and less on explanations that describe how the system works. These findings suggest that the ""News Feed"" FYI' series would be more helpful for increasing users' confidence in the system, but not improving their trust in the system.

Much of the existing research literature on email use focuses on productivity or work settings. However, personal use of email has rarely been studied in depth. With the growth of messaging platforms being used for an increasing amount of personal communication, yet email use remaining high, we were interested in learning what Americans are using email for in their daily lives in 2016. To explore this topic, we use qualitative data from over 150 interviews with personal email users as well as quantitative data from several larger survey-based studies. We will show that personal email use is very different from what has been previously studied by workplace researchers and that daily use is largely focused on receiving and viewing B2C messages such as coupons, deals, receipts, and event notifications with personal communication over email diminished to a rarer, less-than-daily occurrence. We discuss the implications of this for the design of email and communications clients and present a design and prototype for an application that seeks to support these more frequent uses of consumer email.

ViVo automatically generates short video clips from existing movies with the target word highlighted in the subtitles. In particular, we apply a word sense disambiguation algorithm to identify the appropriate movie scenes with adequate contextual information for learning. We analyze the challenges and feasibility of this approach and describe our interaction design. A user study showed that learners were able to retain nearly 30% more new words with ViVo than with a standard bilingual dictionary days after learning.

Using data from 1.2M news reading sessions, we examine and evaluate three increasingly sophisticated models of sub-document attention computed from viewport time, the time a page component is visible on the user display. Our modeling incorporates prior eye-tracking knowledge about onscreen reading, and we validate it by showing how, when used to estimate user reading rate, it aligns with known empirical measures. We then show how our models reveal an interaction between article topic and attention to page elements.

Facebook accounts are secured against unauthorized access through passwords and device-level security. Those defenses, however, may not be sufficient to prevent social insider attacks, where attackers know their victims, and gain access to a victim's account by interacting directly with their device. To characterize these attacks, we ran two MTurk studies. In the first (n = 1,308), using the list experiment method, we estimated that 24% of participants had perpetrated social insider attacks and that 21% had been victims (and knew about it). In the second study (n = 45), participants wrote stories detailing personal experiences with such attacks. Using thematic analysis, we typified attacks around five motivations (fun, curiosity, jealousy, animosity, and utility), and explored dimensions associated with each type. Our combined findings indicate that social insider attacks are common, often have serious emotional consequences, and have no simple mitigation.

Webuild: Automatically distributing assembly tasks among collocated workers to improve coordination,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026036,17,,"
Physical construction and assembly tasks are often carried out by groups of collocated workers, and they can be difficult to coordinate. Group members must spend time deciding how to split up the task, how to assign subtasks to each other, and in what order subtasks should be completed. Informed by an observational study examining group coordination challenges, we built a task distribution system called WeBuild. Our custom algorithm dynamically assigns subtasks to workers in a group, taking into account factors such as the dependencies between subtasks and the skills of each group member. Each worker views personalized step-by-step instructions on a mobile phone, while a dashboard visualizes the entire process. An initial study found that WeBuild reduced the start-up time needed to coordinate and begin a task, and provides direction for future research to build on toward improving group efficiency and coordination for complex tasks.

Smart thermostats offer impressive scope for adapting to users' thermal comfort preferences and saving energy in shared work environments. Yet human interactions with smart thermostats thus far amount to an assumption from designers that users are willing and able to provide unbiased data at regular intervals; which may be unrealistic. In this paper we highlight the variety of social factors which complicate users' relationships with smart thermostats in shared work environments. These include social dynamics, expectations, and contextually specific factors that influence motivations for interaction with the system. In response we outline our framework towards a Smarter Thermostat: one which better accounts for these messy social inevitabilities, is equipped for a decline in user feedback over time and one which augments rather than attempts to replaces human intelligence- thereby ensuring a smarter thermostat does not create dumber humans.

HCI researchers investigating the politics of technology design have recently focused on how design practice can tackle ""Matters of Concern"" - complex social issues perceived and experienced in multiple ways. These researchers suggest design research can generate new networks of human and non-human actors to express and act on these issues. Prior studies, however, tend to restrict their networks within traditional boundaries (e.g. existing organizations, local communities) and categories (e.g. human/nonhuman binary) without examining their significance for participants. We suggest collaborative map making as a reflexive method for understanding current Matters of Concern from the perspectives of diverse actors, not just researchers. As case studies of the method's use, we present two studies of domestic computing technologies in the US and South Korea, which show how collaborative map making allows salient networks to expand beyond the individual actors in the home to local and global power issues outside of boundaries (e.g. physical house) and categories (e.g. private/public space) commonly recognized in HCI. Our methodology provides HCI researchers with a way to understand existing Matters of Concern, so they can position themselves to address and act on these issues.

Fieldward and pathward: Dynamic guides for defining your own gestures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025764,17,https://inria.hal.science/hal-01614267/document,"
Although users accomplish ever more tasks on touch-enabled mobile devices, gesture-based interaction remains limited and almost never customizable by users. Our goal is to help users create gestures that are both personally memorable and reliably recognized by a touch-enabled mobile device. We address these competing requirements with two dynamic guides that use progressive feedforward to interactively visualize the ""negative space"" of unused gestures: the Pathward technique suggests four possible completions to the current gesture, and the Fieldward technique uses color gradients to reveal optimal directions for creating recognizable gestures. We ran a two-part experiment in which 27 participants each created 42 personal gesture shortcuts on a smartphone, using Pathward, Fieldward or No Feedforward. The Fieldward technique best supported the most common user strategy, i.e. to create a memorable gesture first and then adapt it to be recognized by the system. Users preferred the Fieldward technique to Pathward or No Feedforward, and remembered gestures more easily when using the technique. Dynamic guides can help developers design novel gesture vocabularies and support users as they design custom gestures for mobile applications.

Free the hands! Enhanced target selection via a variable-friction shoe,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025625,17,,"
While several foot-controlled pointing devices have been explored as alternatives to conventional interfaces, we are interested in whether such devices can achieve higher performance with the addition of variable friction. Users wore our variable-friction prototype shoe on their right foot, which they slid on a low-friction surface to control a mouse cursor. Two interface modes were evaluated: constant (CF) and variable friction (VF), under the ISO 9241-9 standard for pointing device evaluation. For the variable-friction modality, target regions were high friction to provide sliding resistance cues. Our findings confirmed that variable-friction foot-controlled pointing can achieve throughput competitive with a range of hand-controlled devices. This suggests the potential for taking advantage of foot input for simple pointing tasks, in particular when the hands are overloaded. With respect to other foot-controlled pointing systems, our implementation offered improved performance and comparable error rates. In addition, the analysis provided further insight into the design of foot-controlled input devices.

Individuals diagnosed with dementia are often most concerned about loss of independence, defined as the ability to continue living in one's own home. Currently, assistive technologies that provide in-home cognitive support for those with degenerative brain diseases have not been widely adopted, and individuals often rely entirely on informal caregivers to aid them in planning and performing the daily activities that allow them to continue living independently. To help these individuals, we designed Robin, a conceptual context-aware assistive application that supports independent living for users with cognitive impairments by providing temporally and physically appropriate audio prompting for the routine tasks that are most important for health outcomes and life satisfaction.

However, in synthetic categories such as cars, objects with similar taxonomy can have very different appearance: e.g. a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-HD looks the same as a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-LL but very different from a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-SVT. We introduce a graph based crowdsourcing algorithm to automatically group visually indistinguishable objects together. Using our workflow, we label 712,430 images by ~1,000 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers; resulting in the largest fine-grained visual dataset reported to date with 2,657 categories of cars annotated at 1/20th the cost of hiring experts.

Insomnia can drastically affect individuals' overall well-being and work performance, with substantial costs to society and industry. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychotherapeutic treatment, which requires patients to track sleep and share the data with CBT-I clinicians.

In this paper, we aim to identify opportunities to leverage technology to assist clinicians in delivering quality and effective CBT-I services to broader populations. Toward this goal, we conducted formative studies, including 11 CBT-I clinic observations and 17 semi-structured interviews, to understand the current workflow of CBT-I and associated challenges. We discuss how technology can assist clinicians and patients throughout the various steps of CBT-I workflow while addressing some of the identified challenges, and more broadly, how technology can make space for clinicians and patients to build quality therapeutic relationships.

Previous research on virtual sociality in games suggests that players use custom avatars to reflect, alter, and perform new identities in digital spaces. However, this study explores an alternative theory of social performance by analyzing a competitive game, Super Smash Bros.

This study shows how Melee players treat virtual characters as performative instruments, similar to the violin or the piano. In forum posts and player-created media, Melee players emphasize the need to train one's hands, eyes, and mind in order to master a character's complexity and express style and skills in live matches. Instrumental embodiment in a competitive game like Melee thus positions players as virtuosos who perform for perceptive audiences. This research points to a range of ways that players may relate to virtual bodies, connected to distinct kinds of social activities.

However, in doing so, they expose themselves to potential risks, ranging from being targets of robbery to the more subtle social losses through being seen to be rude or inattentive to those around them. In nature, some animals can blend into their environments to avoid being eaten or to reduce their impact on the ecosystem around them. Taking inspiration from these evolved systems we investigate the notion of chameleon approaches for mobile interaction design. Our probes were motivated, inspired and refined through extended interactions with people drawn from contexts with differing ranges of security and privacy concerns. Through deployments on users' own devices, our prototypes show the value of the concept.

Acquiring Chinese tones is often considered as the most difficult task in learning Chinese as a Second Language (CSL). Recently, ToneWars, a collaborative mobile learning game, demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of connecting CSL learners with native speakers for tone learning. However, the synchronous gameplay nature in ToneWars can be hard to scale due to the time constraint and limited availability of native speakers. We present principled research to make ToneWars scalable and sustainable. First, we address the scalability issue via asynchronous modeling of native speakers. Second, we quantify whether a CSL learner achieves native level mastery for a specific phrase, and explore the use of fine-grained feedback on language mastery as a sustainable motivator for language learning. The insights in this research are generalizable to designing second language learning technologies beyond Chinese. In a longitudinal study with 18 CSL learners, we found that asynchronous gameplay significantly improved learning with an average gain of 29.7 tones and 16.4 syllables, and helped participants achieve native level mastery on 58.2 out of 69 phrases.

Analysis of student data is critical for improving education. In particular, educators need to understand what approaches their students are taking to solve a problem.

PathViewer leverages ideas from flow diagrams and natural language processing to visualize the sequences of intermediate steps that students take. Using PathViewer, we analyzed how several students solved a Python assignment, discovering interesting and unexpected patterns. Our results suggest that PathViewer can allow educators to quickly identify areas of interest, drill down into specific areas, and identify student approaches to the problem as well as misconceptions they may have.

With the increasing popularity of mobile video games, game designers and developers are starting to integrate geolocation information into such games. Although popular location-based games (LBGs) such as Ingress and Pokémon Go have millions of users, research still needs to be carried out to fully understand the ways in which such games impact upon a player's interaction with other players and their physical surroundings. Consequently, there is limited knowledge on how user behavior can be addressed and drawn upon as a design resource to further engage and motivate players to play. To further understand this, we developed a LBG called CityConqueror and have conducted an in 'the wild' study. This initial study starts to unpack the ways that human territoriality can be expressed in LBGs to facilitate player motivation, engagement and can support the integration of the game in the player's daily life. Based on our findings we propose a series of design implications for LBGs. The primary purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the importance of territoriality and the way that this can be drawn upon as a resource for design.

The social lives of individuals with traumatic brain injury,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025784,15,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p182.pdf,"
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can affect all aspects of an individual's life, including physical ability, communication, and mental health, and present chronic health conditions that persist throughout the lifespan. Although prior work documents a decrease in social interaction following brain injury, little is known about how individuals with TBI engage in social behavior during their recovery, how others in their lives participate, and how these interactions occur in both online and offline contexts. We examine these issues through an interview study involving individuals with TBI, as well as caregivers and social contacts of individuals with TBI. Our analysis identifies the concept of social re-emergence, a non-linear process of developing a new social identity that involves withdrawing from social life, developing goals for social participation, disclosing health information for social support and acceptance, and attaining social independence.

Awareness of and connections to a local community are important for building social capital, sharing resources, and providing physical support, but have been elusive to create in dense urban environments. We describe the design and implementation of MoveMeant, a system aimed to increase local community awareness through shared location traces. MoveMeant securely uses anonymized location data generated automatically by mobile devices to display aggregate, community-level location data. We report findings from interviews with residents in the Bronx, New York City who participated in a deployment of MoveMeant over a 6-week period. Our findings show that people use the anonymous information to make judgments about the people and places in their community, while opting to reveal their identity for third places where there is an opportunity to connect socially.

ABBAS: an adaptive bio-sensors based assistive system,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053179,41,,"
Assistive systems have become commercially available to help new workers or workers with cognitive disabilities to learn new tasks. However, continuous feedback systems can make the worker feel patronized or bored, which might influence their performance. We present ABBAS, a novel integration of four different bio-sensors into an assistive system, using in-situ projection for providing feedback and measuring workers' stress levels during assembly work tasks through bio-sensors in real-time. It adjusts work steps according to the worker's state. In two user studies, we assessed the suitability of different bio-sensors to detect the worker's stress level and showed the feasibility of GSR to create adaptive assistive systems that consider the workers' current physiological state. Finally, we discuss how integrating bio-sensors influences assistive systems and leads to both opportunities and challenges for assistive technology in general.

As interactive technologies evolve and reach into every aspect of modern life, research practices in human-computer interaction (HCI) have changed. The methodological and epistemological foundations of the field are shifting to reflect the diversity of contexts in which rapidly changing digital technology is being used. Alongside these changes, new ethical challenges emerge for the HCI community, both in terms of research ethics and responsible research and innovation. Open dilemmas include issues such as the shifting meaning of informed consent, anonymisation or privacy in an always-online world. The SIGCHI Ethics Committee has been established to look into the processes, practices and structures at SIGCHI venues to deal with such ethical dilemmas and how they can be addressed in a transparent, consistent and open way. This town hall style panel will be an opportunity to prompt community discussion and collect input into how we can further address these challenges.

Despite the long development of Graphical User Interfaces, working with multiple graphical objects remains a challenge, due to the difficulties of forming complex selections, ambiguities of operations, and tediousness of repetitively unselect-reselect or ungroup-regroup objects. Instead of tackling them as individual problems, we attribute it to the lack of system support to the general selection-action cycles. We propose Collection Objects to not only support a single fast selection-action cycle but also allow multiple cycles to be chained together into a fluid workflow. Collection Objects unifies selection, grouping, and manipulation of aggregate selections into a single object, with which selection can be composed with various techniques, modified for later actions, grouped with objects inside still directly accessible, and quasi-moded for less context switching. We implemented Collection Object in the context of a vector drawing application with simultaneous pen and touch input. Results of an expert evaluation show that Collection Objects holds considerable promises for fluid interaction with multiple objects.

Serendipitous language learning in mixed reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053098,40,,"
Mixed Reality promises a new way to learn in the world: blending holograms with our surroundings to create contextually rich experiences that find their place in our daily routine. Existing situated learning platforms limit the learner and implicitly enforce the designer's intent by hard-coding content and predetermining what elements in the environment are actionable. In this paper, we define the framework of Serendipitous Learning in Mixed Reality as situated, incidental learning that occurs naturally in the user's environment and stems from the learner's curiosity. This framework is explored within the context of second language acquisition. We present WordSense, a Mixed Reality platform that recognizes objects in the learner's vicinity and embeds holographic content that identifies the corresponding word, provides sentence and definition cues for practice, and displays dynamic audiovisual content that shows example usage. By employing markerless tracking and dynamically linked content, WordSense enables serendipitous language learning in the wild.

These include Avatar (a 3D avatar in co-located with the other user), BoundingBox (similar to HTC's ""chaperone""), and CameraOverlay (live video feed overlaid on the virtual environment). Using a simulated second user, we found that CameraOverlay and Avatar had the fastest travel time around an obstacle, but BoundingBox had the fewest collisions at 0.07 collision/trial versus 0.2 collisions/trial for Avatar and 0.4 collisions/trial for CameraOverlay. However, subjective participant impressions strongly favoured Avatar and CameraOverlay over BoundingBox. Based on these results, we propose future studies on hybrid methods combining the best aspects of Avatar (speed, user preference) and BoundingBox (safety).

Experimentation plays an essential role in exploratory programming, and programmers apply version control operations when switching the part of the source code back to the past state during experimentation. However, these operations, which we refer to as micro-versioning, are not well supported in current programming environments. We first examined previous studies to clarify the requirements for a micro-versioning tool. We then developed a micro-versioning tool that displays visual cues representing possible micro-versioning operations in a textual code editor. Our tool includes a history model that generates meaningful candidates by combining a regional undo model and tree-structured undo model. The history model uses code executions as a delimiter to segment text edit operations into meaning groups. A user study involving programmers indicated that our tool satisfies the above-mentioned requirements and that it is useful for exploratory programming.

We review the core text on this debate and other similar discussions on HCI methodologies and reflexive accounts of research in domains such as 'Research through Design' and 'Feminist HCI'. We highlight the importance of practicing reflexivity through dissemination and introduce 'Research Fictions' in the form of video essays and live performances, produced by the first author with her colleagues, based on their HCI submissions. Through experimenting with alternative dissemination formats, we argue that our exploratory processes engender a practice of reflexivity within a research lab.

This paper identifies a body of HCI research wherein the researchers take part in digitally mediated creative experiences alongside participants. We present our definition and rationale for ""self-situated performance research"" based on theories in both the HCI and performance literatures. We then analyse four case studies of this type of work, ranging from overtly ""performative"" staged events to locative audio and public making. We argue that by interrogating experience from within the context of self-situated performance, the 'performer/researcher' extends traditional practices in HCI in the following four ways: developing an intimate relationship between researchers and participants, providing new means of making sense of interactions, shaping participants' relationship to the research, and enabling researchers to refine their work as it is being conducted.

As an alternative to online labor markets, several platforms recruit unpaid online volunteers to participate in behavioral experiments that provide personalized feedback. These platforms rely on word-of-mouth sharing by previous participants for recruitment of new participants. We analyzed the impact of performance feedback provided at the end of an experiment on 81,131 participants' sharing behavior. We show that higher performing participants share significantly more. We also show that self-verification has a moderating effect: people who expected to do poorly are not affected by a high score, but people who expected to do as well as others or better, are. In a second experiment, we evaluate three distinct social comparison designs for the presentation of the results. As expected, the design that most emphasized participants' relative success led to most sharing. Contrary to our expectations, people who expected to do poorly benefited from the most optimistic social comparison more than participants who expected to do better than others.

The beginning of a relationship between the user and a platform is the moment where motivations take part and the overall strategy? the flow, messages, interactions and UI design elements -- should be carefully planned, so the experience as a whole can support new users' engagement. Such an important strategy still lacks systematic investigation. Most of what is employed by the industry result from empirical testing that turns out to serve a particular product in a certain instance. This research aims to provide scientific evidence regarding the effect of each onboarding element on user engagement and experience, in addition to solid guidelines that support decision making for future designs.

A gaze gesture-based user authentication system to counter shoulder-surfing attacks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053070,40,,"
Shoulder-surfing is the act of spying on an authorized user of a computer system with the malicious intent of gaining unauthorized access. Current solutions to address shoulder-surfing such as graphical passwords, gaze input, tactile interfaces, and so on are limited by low accuracy, lack of precise gaze-input, and susceptibility to video analysis attack. We present an intelligent gaze gesture-based system that authenticates users from their unique gaze patterns onto moving geometric shapes. The system authenticates the user by comparing their scan-path with each shapes' paths and recognizing the closest path. In a study with 15 users, authentication accuracy was found to be 99% with true calibration and 96% with disturbed calibration. Also, our system is 40% less susceptible and nearly nine times more time-consuming to video analysis attacks compared to a gaze- and PIN-based authentication system.

Much of how we construct meaning in the real world is qualitative rather than quantitative. We think and act in response to, and in dialogue with, qualities of phenomena, and relationships between them.

There are more opportunities within HCI for qualitative displays and interfaces, for information presentation, and an aid to help people explore their own thinking and relationships with ideas.

We found that NNS often shifted between English and their native language. The way language shift happened differed for formal meetings, informal conversations, and instant messaging. Language variation was often associated with shifts in content, participants, and communication medium. Further analysis indicated that language shift had both benefits and costs for team communication, depending on the context in which it happened.

Many rapid fabrication technologies are directed towards layer wise printing or laser based prototyping. We propose WireFab, a rapid modeling and prototyping system that uses bent metal wires as the structure framework. WireFab approximates both the skeletal articulation and the skin appearance of the corresponding virtual skin meshes, and it allows users to personalize the designs by (1) specifying joint positions and part segmentations, (2) defining joint types and motion ranges to build a wire-based skeletal model, and (3) abstracting the segmented meshes into mixed-dimensional appearance patterns or attachments. The WireFab is designed to allow the user to choose how to best preserve the fidelity of the topological structure and articulation motion while selectively maintaining the fidelity of the geometric appearance. Compared to 3D-printing based high-fidelity fabrication systems, WireFab increases prototyping speed by ignoring unnecessary geometric details while preserving structural integrity and articulation motion. In addition, other rapid or low-fidelity fabrication systems produce only static models, while WireFab produces posable articulated models and has the potential to enable personalized functional products larger than the machines that produce them.

This paper offers a new theoretical frame for those interested in poverty and design. As digital access rates peak, technology maintenance argues that the digital divide will increasingly manifest in the (in)ability to stay connected. As a novel and conservative test, open-ended data from a 748-person university student survey of technology maintenance were analyzed. Use and ownership were ubiquitous, but students demonstrated variability in coping with the inevitable; disconnection was more burdensome for low-resourced students. Findings extend technology maintenance and are leveraged as a starting point for three calls for action in HCI: 1) the CHI community should research the burdens of poverty in poor and wealthy contexts; 2) new HCI projects should accommodate inconsistent access; and, 3) new design choices should minimize disruption and optimize stability.

Consumer to creator: How households buy furniture to inform design and fabrication interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025666,12,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p484.pdf,"
Emerging technologies for digital design and fabrication let people participate in the making of objects that were previously dominated by professional designers. A growing body of work in HCI provides understanding in the activities of designing and making by novices and in maker communities. However, we know little about how casual users might employ these technologies with the goal of having an object in their home that satisfies a need. We present a long-term qualitative study in which we followed 16 households during a purchasing process of furniture items for their homes. We looked into how families discover what they need, find solutions, realize a solution in their house and put it to use. The results provide insights into their design activities and workflow and we identify two distinct stages: understanding needs and prototyping a solution. Based on the findings, we discuss the social practice of acquiring and appropriating furniture in the home and within families, and identify design opportunities for digital design and fabrication to support people as they create the objects they need, want and desire.

A multifaceted study on eye contact based speaker identification in three-party conversations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025644,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025644,"
To precisely understand human gaze behaviors in three-party conversations, this work is dedicated to look into whether the speaker can be reliably identified from the interlocutors in a three-party conversation on the basis of the interactive behaviors of eye contact, where speech signals are not provided. Derived from a pre-recorded, multimodal, and three-party conversational behavior dataset, a statistical framework is pro- posed to determine who is the speaker from the interactive behaviors of eye contact. Additionally, with the aid of virtual human technologies, a user study is conducted to study whether subjects are capable of distinguishing the speaker from the listeners according to the gaze behaviors of the interlocutors alone. Our results show that eye contact provides a reliable cue for the identification of the speaker in three-party conversations.

The Internet has disrupted the traditional progression of social movements. We explore common characteristics of image-based activism on Instagram by qualitatively analyzing 300 Instagram posts from three social movements: Black Lives Matter, the battle against defunding Planned Parenthood, and the backlash against the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act. We found that common types of images emerged among the three social movements, indicating a possible underlying pattern in social movement content posted on Instagram. Users also engage in workarounds to leverage Instagram toward a collective goal, going beyond the features offered by the platform to communicate their message. These findings have implications for future work studying social movement theories online.

This paper presents a case study of an interactive performance that was produced and designed to encourage civic engagement and reflection in relation to the social tensions in a low-income suburb, mostly inhabited by people with immigrant backgrounds. The design of the technological setup in the performance encouraged participation by means of text entries that audience members could share with others. The analysis draws on the corpus of interview and observational data collected, as well as the related text messages that were shared during the performance. We illustrate the different levels at which citizens make sense of societal issues they are concerned about, as well as the audience-citizens' perception of participating in such an artistic experience.

There is a growing body of research examining the role of technology in supporting the care of--and relationships surrounding--people with dementia, yet little attention has been given to how this relates to younger family members. We conducted a qualitative study based on a series of 6 co-design workshops conducted with 14 young people who had personal experience with dementia. Initially, our workshops focused on understanding the difficulties that young people face when engaging, interacting and being with people with dementia. Initial analysis of workshop data informed the design of three digital tool concepts that were used as the basis for user enactment workshops. Our findings highlight the young people's desire to be more involved in their family discussions around dementia and a need for them to find new ways to connect with their loved ones with dementia. We offer a set of design considerations for future systems that support these needs and reflect on some of the complexities we faced around engaging young people in this difficult topic of discussion.

Finding (and re-finding) locations in text documents is a common activity for most computer users -- but tools for document navigation are still limited in many ways. Previous research has shown that a spatially-stable overview of the entire document can be substantially faster than any other navigation technique -- particularly when revisiting previous locations. However, the overview technique has only been tested in a limited laboratory study, so little is known about whether it works in more realistic contexts. To answer this question, we developed a PDF viewer that incorporates several document-navigation techniques, and carried out two studies. First, we ran a field experiment in which users carried out search tasks using an overview and other techniques -- on their own computers in a non-laboratory environment. Second, we ran a smaller field study in which people used our viewer (with choice of navigation techniques) for their own PDF tasks. In the field experiment, the overview was significantly and substantially faster than other techniques, and in the field study, the technique was frequently used for a wide variety of documents. Our work provides confirmation of the value of spatially stable overviews as a basis for document navigation.

While current fabrication technologies have led to a wealth of techniques to create physical artifacts of virtual designs, they require unidirectional and constraining interaction workflows. Instead of acting as intelligent agents that support human's natural tendencies to iteratively refine ideas and experiment, today's fabrication machines function as output devices. In this work, we argue that fabrication machines and tools should be thought of as live collaborators to aid in-situ creativity, adapting physical dynamics come from unique materiality and/or machine specific parameters. Through a series of design narratives, we explore Human-FabMachine Interaction (HFI), a novel viewpoint from which to reflect on the importance of (i) interleaved design thinking and refinement during fabrication, (ii) enriched methods of interaction with fabrication machines regardless of skill level, and (iii) concurrent human and machine interaction.

We present EarthTones, cosmetic-inspired wearable chemical sensing powders to detect and display harmful environmental factors through color change. We seek to create an analog display experience through chemical reactions that overcome current constraints of rigid, battery-laden wearable displays. We designed three unique chemical changing powders to reflect elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO), ultraviolet (UV) rays, and ozone (O3). The powders achieve color changes distinguishable to the human eye, while maintaining an aesthetic appeal to the wearer. Our technical evaluations confirmed the performance of the powders to detect and display elevated levels. An 18-person exploratory study provided insight to the perceptions, possibilities, and challenges of a powder form factor for wearable environmental visualization. Through this paper, we intend to enable the use of colorimetric chemical displays for HCI researchers and designers. More generally, we seek to encourage the research and use of chemical-based sensors and interdisciplinary research in HCI.

Our findings show that the impact of input modality and display size on spatial memory is not straightforward, but characterized by trade-offs between spatial memory, efficiency, and user satisfaction.

Spatial datasets, such as tweets in a geographic area, often exhibit different distribution patterns at multiple levels of scale, such as live updates about events occurring in very specific locations on the map. Navigating in such multi-scale data-rich spaces is often inefficient, requires users to choose between overview or detail information, and does not support identifying spatial patterns at varying scales. In this paper, we propose TopoGroups, a novel context-preserving technique that aggregates spatial data into hierarchical clusters to improve exploration and navigation at multiple spatial scales. The technique uses a boundary distortion algorithm to minimize the visual clutter caused by overlapping aggregates. Our user study explores multiple visual encoding strategies for TopoGroups including color, transparency, shading, and shapes in order to convey the hierarchical and statistical information of the geographical aggregates at different scales.

The mouse had the best throughput at 4.73 bps, followed by the touchpad at 2.98 bps, then the gyrosensor at 2.85 bps, and finally the thumbstick at 2.39 bps. This indicates that the touchpad and gyrosensor are good alternatives to the traditional thumbstick, despite prevalence of the thumbstick on modern game controllers.

Most web applications are designed as one-size-fits-all, despite considerable variation in people's expertise, physical abilities, and other factors that impact interaction. For example, some web applications require the use of a mouse, precluding use by many people with severe motor disabilities. Other applications require laborious manual input that a skilled developer could automate if the application were scriptable. This paper presents Genie, a system that automatically reverse engineers an abstract model of the underlying commands in a web application, then enables interaction with that functionality through alternative interfaces and other input modalities (e.g., speech, keyboard, or command line input). Genie comprises an abstract model of command properties, behaviors, and dependencies as well as algorithms that reverse engineer this model from an existing web application through static and dynamic program analysis. We evaluate Genie by developing several interfaces that automatically add support for speech, keyboard, and command line input to arbitrary web applications.

A few troublemakers often spoil online environments for everyone else. An extremely disruptive type of abuser is the troll, whose malicious activities are relatively non-obvious, and thus difficult to detect and contain -- particularly by automated systems. A growing corpus of qualitative research focuses on trolling, and differentiates it from other forms of abuse; however, its findings are not directly actionable into automated systems. On the other hand, quantitative research uses definitions of ""troll"" that mostly fail to capture what moderators and users consider trolling. We address this gap by giving a quantitative analysis of posts, conversations, and users, specifically sanctioned for trolling in an online forum. Although trolls (unlike most other abusers) hardly stand out in a conversation e.g. in terms of vocabulary, textit{how} they interact, rather than textit{what} they contribute, provides cues of their malicious intent.

E-commerce designers must decide how many products to display at one time. Choice overload research has demonstrated the surprising finding that more choice is not necessarily better?selecting from larger choice sets can be more cognitively demanding and can result in lower levels of choice satisfaction. This research tests the choice overload effect in an e-commerce context and explores how the choice overload effect is influenced by an individual's tendency to maximize or satisfice decisions. We conducted an online experiment with 611 participants randomly assigned to select a gourmet chocolate bar from either 12, 24, 40, 50, 60, or 72 different options. Consistent with prior work, we find that maximizers are less satisfied with their product choice than satisficers. However, using Bayesian analysis, we find that it's unlikely that choice set size affects choice satisfaction by much, if at all. We discuss why the decision-making process may be different in e-commerce contexts than the physical settings used in previous choice overload experiments.

We propose a prototype fabrication method to replicate part of an outdoor climbing route and enable the same sensorimotor experience in an indoor gym. We start with 3D reconstruction of the rock wall using multi-view stereo and use reference videos of a climber in action to identify localized rock features that are necessary for ascent. We create 3D models akin to traditional indoor climbing holds, fabricated using rapid prototyping, molding and casting techniques. This results in robust holds accurately replicating the features and configuration of the original rock route. Validation was performed on two rock climbing sites in New Hampshire and Utah. We verified our results by comparing climbers' moves on the indoor replicas and original outdoor routes.

The results paint a complicated picture with both positive and negative reactions to the inclusion of foreign-language reviews. Roughly 26-28% of subjects clicked to see translations of the foreign-language content when given the opportunity, and those who did so were more likely to select the product with foreign-language reviews than those who did not.

In addition to encyclopedia articles and software, peer production communities produce structured data, e.g., Wikidata and OpenStreetMap's metadata. Structured data from peer production communities has become increasingly important due to its use by computational applications, such as CartoCSS, MapBox, and Wikipedia infoboxes. However, this structured data is usable by applications only if it follows standards. We did an interview study focused on OpenStreetMap's knowledge production processes to investigate how -- and how successfully -- this community creates and applies its data standards. Our study revealed a fundamental tension between the need to produce structured data in a standardized way and OpenStreetMap's tradition of contributor freedom. We extracted six themes that manifested this tension and three overarching concepts, correctness, community, and code, which help make sense of and synthesize the themes. We also offered suggestions for improving OpenStreetMap's knowledge production processes, including new data models, sociotechnical tools, and community practices (e.g. stronger leadership).

At least 360 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss that frequently causes difficulties in day-to-day conversations. Traditional technology (e.g., hearing aids) often fails to offer enough value, has low adoption rates, and can result in social stigma. Speechreading can dramatically improve conversational understanding, but speechreading is a skill that can be challenging to learn. To address this, we developed a novel speechreading acquisition framework that can be used to design Speechreading Acquisition Tools (SATs) - a new type of technology to improve speechreading acquisition. We interviewed seven speechreading tutors and used thematic analysis to identify and organise the key elements of our framework. We then evaluated our framework by using it to: 1) categorise every tutor-identified speechreading teaching technique, 2) critically evaluate existing conversational aids, and 3) design three new SATs. Through the use of SATs designed using our framework, the speechreading abilities of people with hearing loss around the world should be enhanced, thereby improving the conversational foundation of their day-to-day lives.

All was developed and evaluated with 20 surgeons. The results show that our techniques can be used with minimal learning time and no significant differences regarding completion time and usability compared to the control condition relying on verbal instruction of an assistant. Furthermore, IVOR as a tool was well received by the surgeons, although they had no prior experience with virtual reality. This confirms IVOR is an effective tool for user-centered design and evaluation, providing a portable, yet realistic substitution for a real OR for early evaluations.

Our analysis focused on how the programmers arranged and navigated among open information patches (i.e., code modules and program output). Key findings of our study included that Patchworks users made significantly fewer click actions per navigation, juxtaposed patches side by side significantly more, and exhibited significantly fewer navigation mistakes than tabbed-editor users. Based on these findings and more, we propose five general principles for the design of effective navigation affordances in code editors.

Seven youth with autism (mean age = 12.7, SD = 4.2) interacted with a CAI program, TeachTown Basics, for 15 consecutive sessions. Video recordings of the participants' faces were collected during these sessions and facial expressions from these videos were analyzed using CERT, an algorithm that automatically outputs intensity values for each facial action unit (AU). Using these data, we attempted to operationally define two engagement indices: (1) behavioral engagement, the proportion of time a participant had their face oriented to the computer screen; and (2) emotional engagement, the activation of AUs previously associated with CAI. Our results suggest that both indices strongly correlated with one another, but that emotional (not behavioral) engagement predicted test performance. CAI knowledge domain, participant sex, and developmental age also contributed to the prediction.

End-users are often exposed to uncertain data in interactive systems such as personal health apps, intelligent navigation systems, and systems driven by machine learning. On one hand, communicating uncertainty may improve the understanding of data and predictions. On the other hand, communicating uncertainty can greatly confuse users and decrease trust. While some specialized guidelines for dealing with uncertainty exist within particular fields such as information visualization or context-aware computing, HCI lacks general design guidelines around the more basic question of ""will communicating uncertainty rather help or confuse my users'"" The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from across HCI and related fields to establish a better understanding of when and how to design for uncertainty. The outcome of the workshop will be a set of real-world application scenarios with descriptions of the impact of presenting uncertainty in that scenario. Additionally, we will create a set of design guidelines that supports designers and researchers in this emerging space in evaluating whether and how to present uncertainty.

Results indicated that primary users' judgments of relational satisfaction with annoyers were influenced by annoyers' narcissistic personality and their overall propensity for posting overly self-focused content. Commitment affected primary users' use of both passive ""unfollowing"" and active ""unfriending"" in response to annoyers' behavior. Decisions to maintain or terminate online friendships are related to judgments and actions of both partners. Overall, these results emphasize the dyadic nature of relational maintenance and termination processes in online environments, and the importance of studying them as such.

Soma-based design theory,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027082,28,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/2exab/ea550.pdf,"
Movement-based interaction design is increasingly popular, with application domains ranging from dance, sport, gaming to physical rehabilitation. In a workshop at CHI 2016, a set of prominent artists, game design-ers, and interaction designers embarked on a research journey to explore what we came to refer to as ""aesthetics in soma-based design"". In this follow-up work-shop, we would like to take the next step, shifting from discussing the philosophical underpinnings we draw upon to explain and substantiate our practice, to form our own interaction design theory and conceptualisations. We propose that soma-based design theory needs practical, pragmatic as well as analytical study -- otherwise the felt dimension will be missing. We will consider how such tacit knowledge can be articulated, documented and shared. To ground the discussion firmly in the felt experience of our own practice, the work-shop is organised as a joint practical design work session, supported by analytical study.

Understanding the cost of driving trips,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025686,12,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p430.pdf,"
Driving is the second highest expense for the average American household. Yet few people know the total cost of owning and operating their vehicles, and most cannot estimate accurately how much a common driving trip (like a daily commute) costs. There are an increasing number of viable alternatives for personal transportation, such as car services (e.g. Uber, Lyft), in addition to ridesharing, transit, biking, and walking. Cost is one factor in transportation mode choice, and awareness of the cost of driving is useful in making better informed decisions. To bridge this awareness gap, we built and deployed a system that makes the total cost of each driving trip (including depreciation, maintenance, insurance, and fuel) visible to the user. After this intervention, participants were able to more accurately and confidently estimate costs of their driving commutes, and transfer this knowledge to other trips for which they had not seen a cost.

A predictive model of emergency physician task resumption following interruptions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025700,11,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2405.pdf,"
Interruptions in the emergency department (ED) can have serious patient safety consequences, and few solutions exist to mitigate the disruptiveness of interruptions. We developed a theoretically motivated model to predict the likelihood of emergency physicians returning to an interrupted task. Eighteen emergency physicians were observed individually for two-hour blocks of time, resulting in a total of 2160 minutes of observation and 231 interruptions. We used a mixed effects logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of primary task resumption after interruptions. The likelihood of primary task resumption was predicted by memory decay, measured by the duration of the interruption, workload, measured by the patient volume during the shift, and whether shift was day or night. With a better understanding of these interruptions, we can help design interventions to manage interruptions, minimize medical errors, and improve patient safety.

Attention allocation aid for visual search,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025834,11,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025834,"
This paper outlines the development and testing of a novel, feedback-enabled attention allocation aid (AAAD), which uses real-time physiological data to improve human performance in a realistic sequential visual search task. Indeed, by optimizing over search duration, the aid improves efficiency, while preserving decision accuracy, as the operator identifies and classifies targets within simulated aerial imagery. Specifically, using experimental eye-tracking data and measurements about target detectability across the human visual field, we develop functional models of detection accuracy as a function of search time, number of eye movements, scan path, and image clutter. These models are then used by the AAAD in conjunction with real time eye position data to make probabilistic estimations of attained search accuracy and to recommend that the observer either move on to the next image or continue exploring the present image. An experimental evaluation in a scenario motivated from human supervisory control in surveillance missions confirms the benefits of the AAAD.

Media researchers are adopting personalisation in diverse ways to deliver increasingly context-sensitive and customised media experiences. This paper explores user attitudes towards a personalised Electronic Programme Guide which tailors media recommendations based on users' personal data. We used scenario based exploration enabled by the use of probes to convey the functionalities of data-driven personalised EPGs and to facilitate user discussions around its potential use. Users preferred personalised EPGs over current popular EPGs but expressed a significant lack of trust in the personal data collection that drives personalisation. Users appreciated the functionalities afforded by personalisation of media but were apprehensive about the implications of the personal data being collected about them, particularly in the context of their homes. This calls for the need to design future personalised media experiences that help enhance trust in these socio-technical settings.

Group Touch: Distinguishing tabletop users in group settings via statistical modeling of touch pairs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025793,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025793,"
We present Group Touch, a method for distinguishing among multiple users simultaneously interacting with a tabletop computer using only the touch information supplied by the device. Rather than tracking individual users for the duration of an activity, Group Touch distinguishes users from each other by modeling whether an interaction with the tabletop corresponds to either: (1) a new user, or (2) a change in users currently interacting with the tabletop. This reframing of the challenge as distinguishing users rather than tracking and identifying them allows Group Touch to support multi-user collaboration in real-world settings without custom instrumentation. Specifically, Group Touch examines pairs of touches and uses the difference in orientation, distance, and time between two touches to determine whether the same person performed both touches in the pair. Validated with field data from high-school students in a classroom setting, Group Touch distinguishes among users ""in the wild"" with a mean accuracy of 92.92% (SD=3.94%). Group Touch can imbue collaborative touch applications in real-world settings with the ability to distinguish among multiple users.

Recent technology advances in both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are creating an opportunity for a paradigm shift in the design of human-computer interaction systems. Delving into the Reality-Virtuality Continuum, we find Mixed Reality - systems designed to augment the physical world with virtual entities that embody characteristics of real world objects. In the medical field, Mixed Reality systems can overlay real-time and spatially accurate results onto a patient's body without the need for external screens. The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available. Through a combination of literature review, expert analysis, and prototyping we explore the use of Mixed Reality in healthcare.

In order to address this problem, we explored ""VACT (Visual Assistance Concept for Takeover)"", which applies dynamicity to shift visual attention. From a thorough literature review, we have come up with two windshield interface concepts to enhance drivers' vigilance and readiness before the takeover: Useful Field of View (UFOV) and Object-View (OV) Interface. To evaluate the UI concepts, an in-lab experiment was conducted with 57 participants in a semi-naturalistic driving environment. Implications for interface design of visual assistance and its impact on brake reaction time, mental workload and perceived usefulness are discussed.

Our findings show that prior public Wi-Fi users and non-users alike raised a surprising range and depth of conceptions---ranging from suspicion of operators' intentions to monetize, to concerns about sexual image morphing, to fears of phone wipeouts, to aspiration---which were informed by popular media, BlueTooth cultures, and social learning. We found these conceptions of Wi-Fi networks to significantly influence adoption of public Wi-Fi. With enormous investments in public Wi-Fi initiatives, we call for network providers to address these deep conceptions among emerging users; by suggesting ways to build public awareness, better user experiences, and business model innovation.

The low frame rate and high latency of consumer depth cameras limits their use in interactive applications. We propose combining the Kinect depth camera with an ordinary color camera to synthesize a high frame rate and low latency depth image. We exploit common CMOS camera region of interest (ROI) functionality to obtain a high frame rate image over a small ROI. Motion in the ROI is computed by a fast optical flow implementation. The resulting flow field is used to extrapolate Kinect depth images to achieve high frame rate and low latency depth, and optionally predict depth to further reduce latency. Our ""Hybrid HFR Depth"" prototype generates useful depth images at maximum 500Hz with minimum 20ms latency. We demonstrate Hybrid HFR Depth in tracking fast moving objects, handwriting in the air, and projecting onto moving hands. Based on commonly available cameras and image processing implementations, Hybrid HFR Depth may be useful to HCI practitioners seeking to create fast, fluid depth camera-based interactions.

As robots become ubiquitous in our everyday environment, we start seeing them used in groups, rather than individually, to complete tasks. We present a study aimed to understand how different movement patterns impact humans' perceptions of groups of small tabletop robots. To understand this, we focus on the effects of changing the robots' speed, smoothness, and synchronization, on perceived valence, arousal, and dominance. We find that speed had the strongest correlation to these factors. With regard to human emotional response to the robots, we align with and build on prior work dealing with individual robots that correlates speed to valence and smoothness to arousal. In addition, participants noted an increase in positive affect in response to synchronized motion, though synchronization had no significant impact on measured perception. Based on our quantitative and qualitative results, we describe design implications for swarm robot motion.

Head-tracked 3D displays can provide a compelling 3D effect, but even small inaccuracies in the calibration of the participant's viewpoint to the display can disrupt the 3D illusion. We propose a novel interactive procedure for a participant to easily and accurately calibrate a head-tracked display by visually aligning patterns across a multi-screen display. Head-tracker measurements are then calibrated to these known viewpoints. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual patterns and different display shapes. We found that the easiest to align shape was the spherical display and the best calibration pattern was the combination of circles and lines. We performed a quantitative camera-based calibration of a cubic display and found visual calibration outperformed manual tuning and generated viewpoint calibrations accurate to within a degree. Our work removes the usual, burdensome step of manual calibration when using head-tracked displays and paves the way for wider adoption of this inexpensive and effective 3D display technology.

Through a retrospective analysis we conclude that the approach adopted in these cases progressed from complete separation of UXR and design activities to design-inclusive UXR in which design forms an integral part of research. This is reflected by a rearrangement of project activities to identify, envision, enable and evaluate user experiences. Previously the UXR (identify and evaluate) and design (envision and enable) activities were executed sequentially. Now, these four project activities merge in studying design interventions in context over a prolonged time, to iteratively explore and advance UX design qualities.

Nowadays, Syrian refugees are facing major challenges to mingle with the social life of German society. The purpose of this on-going study is to create support and increase empathy of German youths towards Syrian refugees with the developed concept called ""Empathy- Up"" (EMP-UP). The concept aims at levelling the playing field for them through a mobile game. The research done has shown two main critical problems faced by refugees (Syrian): (1) they do not get in contact with locals (Germans), and (2) they feel that Germans do not want to interact with them or accept them in their society. The study shows that when combining a geo-location based mobile game that addresses cultural differences within the game scenario, it's more likely to connect players emotionally with these different cultures. This resulted in minimizing prejudices by locals, increasing their willingness to get to know refugees, and making the first contact with a refugee simpler and more positive. The empathy is created during the game while players are going through the story scenario and when the game ends, both players (locals and refugees) surprisingly meet face-to-face in reality.

Our first experiment revealed that scrolling through a continuous image stream of the navigation path is highly informative, but it becomes tedious with constant use. Discrete image checkpoints require less effort, but can be confusing. A balance may be struck by adding fast video transitions between image checkpoints, but precise control is required to handle difficult situations. Authoring still image checkpoints is also difficult, and this inspired us to invent a new technique using video checkpoints. We conducted a second experiment on authoring and navigation performance and found video checkpoints plus fast video transitions to be better than both image checkpoints plus fast video transitions and traditional written instructions.

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools are used to increase social interaction in collocated settings. Recent research has been primarily constructive (oriented to building of systems) or phenomenon-driven (serving attempts to understand interactions in collocated CMC). The paper contributes a theory-driven approach and examines collocated CMC as a Habermasean ""public sphere"": a space that supports inclusive, civil, and rational discussion. An in-the-wild experimental study comparing CMC with face-to-face (F2F) communication enabled ascertaining that CMC is more inclusive than F2F communication. Respectfulness levels did not differ but were established differently: via collective construction of a common narrative in F2F and through quick reactions in CMC. Similarly, while rationality figures were on a par, F2F communication allowed participants to justify their claims better. The article discusses how a theory-based approach can strengthen phenomenon-driven research with new conceptual frames and measurement tools, and steer constructive research with a normative framework.

Mixed reality (MR) space merges the real and virtual worlds in real time and makes it possible to present and manipulate virtual objects in the real world. However, to manipulate virtual objects, menus are required, and where to display menus in MR space and how to manipulate them are often problems. For example, a virtual touch menu shown in front of a user's face cannot provide the user with touch sensation and interferes with the user's sight. In this study, we propose a method to display a menu on the user's forearm, which is always within reach of the user's hand. The user can obtain touch feeling by directly touching their forearm. An application was developed using this menu, and an informal user study at a previous conference was successful, leaving some minor points to be improved.

TouchTokens are passive tokens that can be recognized on any capacitive surface based on the spatial configuration of the fingers that hold them. However, interaction with these tokens is confined to the basic two-state model of touch interaction as the system only knows the tokens' position and cannot detect tokens that are not touched. We increase the expressive power of TouchTokens by introducing laser-cut lattice hinges in their design, so as to make them flexible. A new recognizer, that analyzes the micro-movements of the fingers that hold the tokens, enables the system to detect when a token is left on the surface rather than taken off it. It can also detect bend events that can be mapped to command triggers, and a squeezed state that can be used for quasi-modal interaction.

Supporting self-care of adolescents with nut allergy through video and mobile educational tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025680,8,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025680,"
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction which is rapid in onset. Adolescents living with anaphylaxis risk often lack the knowledge and skills required to safely manage their condition or talk to friends about it. We designed an educational intervention comprising group discussion around videos of simulated anaphylaxis scenarios and a mobile application containing video-based branching anaphylaxis narratives. We trialed the intervention with 36 nut allergic adolescents. At 1-year follow-up participants had improved adrenaline auto-injector skills and carriage, disease- and age-specific Quality of Life and confidence in anaphylaxis management. At 3-year follow-up adrenaline carriage improved further and confidence remained higher. Participants expressed how the education session was a turning point in taking control of their allergy and how the app facilitated sharing about anaphylaxis with others. We contribute insights regarding design of mobile self-care and peer-support applications for health in adolescence, and discuss strengths and limitations of video-based mobile health interventions.

Save the Kiwi: Encouraging better food management through behaviour change and persuasive design theories in a mobile app,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053192,25,,"
Managing food waste is a means to improve our environmental and economic sustainability, and is achievable both societally and personally. We conceptualized ""Save the Kiwi"", a personal mobile application that communicates food safety information to encourage better food management, primarily in consuming purchased food products before they expire. Instead of simply relaying food information to its user, the application combines elements of behaviour change and persuasive design theories, and uses personified icons to notify its user about the expiry conditions of the associated food items. In an exploratory study, we found that the application has the potential to help users reduce their food waste. We discuss our results and recommend future work to create a viable solution to address food waste issues.

Avatar-mediated and virtual environments hold a unique potential for promoting social skills in children with autism. This paper describes the design of ""Exceptionally Social,"" which is an interactive system that uses avatars to mediate human-to-human interactions for social skills training of children with autism. This system aims to offer the following functionalities: (1) gives children the opportunity to practice social skills in a safe environment, under various contexts. (2) changes the dynamics of the interactions based on the child's affective states. (3) provides visual support for children to teach them different social skills and facilitate their learning. (4) reduces the cognitive load on the interactor (a trained human orchestrating the avatars' behaviors) by providing real-time feedback about a child's affective states and suggesting appropriate visual supports using a recommendation system.

To Miss is Human Information-Theoretic Rationale for Target Misses in Fitts' Law,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025660,9,https://hal.science/hal-01690133/document,"
In usual Fitts' law experiments the outcome of a pointing act can be either measured as an error, i.e., a distance from endpoint to target center, or categorized in an all-or-none way as a hit versus a miss. Information theory offers a useful distinction between transmission errors (the received symbol is wrong) and erasures (the received symbol is empty). Although Fitts' law research has been very much inspired by the information theoretic rationale, the error/erasure distinction has escaped attention so far: Target misses have always been treated as normally-distributed errors, through the effective index of difficulty IDe. The paper introduces a new index of difficulty based on the simple observation that a target miss conveys zero bit of information, i.e., it is an erasure. Not only is the new index more consistent with the fundamentals of information theory, it is much simpler to derive than the ISO-recommended IDe.

Tangibles vs. mouse in educational programming games: Influences on enjoyment and self-beliefs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053115,25,,"
Computer Science (CS) and related skills such as programming and Computational Thinking (CT) have recently become topics of global interest, with a large number of programming games created to engage and educate players. However, there has been relatively limited work to assess 1) the efficacy of such games with respect to critical educational factors such as enjoyment and programming self-beliefs; and 2) whether there are advantages to alternative, physically embodied design approaches (e.g., tangibles as input). To better explore the benefits of a tangible approach, we built and tested two versions of an educational programming game that were identical in design except for the form of interaction (tangible programming blocks vs. mouse input). After testing 34 participants, results showed that while both game versions were successful at improving programming self-beliefs, the tangible version corresponded to higher self-reports of player enjoyment. Overall, this paper presents a comparison between the efficacy of tangible and mouse design approaches for improving key learning factors in educational programming games.

Supporting making fixations and the effect on gaze gesture performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025920,9,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p3022.pdf,"
Gaze gestures are deliberate patterns of eye movements that can be used to invoke commands. These are less reliant on accurate measurement and calibration than other gaze-based interaction techniques. These may be used with wearable displays fitted with eye tracking capability, or as part of an assistive technology. The visual stimuli in the information on the display that can act as fixation targets may or may not be sparse and will vary over time. The paper describes an experiment to investigate how the amount of information provided on a display to assist making fixations affects gaze gesture performance. The impact of providing visualization guides and small fixation targets on the time to complete gestures and error rates is presented. The number and durations of fixations made during gesture completion is used to explain differences in performance as a result of practice and direction of eye movement.

Human-agent collaboration: Can an agent be a partner?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3051138,24,,"
Human-Agent Interaction has been much studied and discussed in the last two decades. We have two starting points for this panel. First we observe that interaction is not the same as collaboration. Collaboration involves mutual goal understanding, preemptive task co-management and shared progress tracking. Second, that much of the on-going discourse around human-agent interaction implies that agents can be trusted, collaborative partners. Our position is that while virtual and embodied agents have the potential to be work partners, for this goal to be achieved we need to better understand what partnership in collaboration involves. In this panel we ask: Can this potential for trusted collaboration be realized? If so, what will it take? This panel will bring together HCI experts who work on collaboration, virtual agent design and human-robot-interaction. Panelists will engage the audience through discussion of their shared and diverging visions, and through suggestions for opportunities and challenges for the future of human-agent collaboration.

Having a crowd estimate a numeric value is the original inspiration for the notion of ""the wisdom of the crowd."" Quality control for such estimated values is challenging because prior, consensus-based approaches for quality control in labeling tasks are not applicable in estimation tasks. We present VoxPL, a high-level programming framework that automatically obtains high-quality crowdsourced estimates of values. The VoxPL domain-specific language lets programmers concisely specify complex estimation tasks with a desired level of confidence and budget. VoxPL's runtime system implements a novel quality control algorithm that automatically computes sample sizes and obtains high quality estimates from the crowd at low cost. To evaluate VoxPL, we implement four estimation applications, ranging from facial feature recognition to calorie counting. The resulting programs are concise---under 200 lines of code---and obtain high quality estimates from the crowd quickly and inexpensively.

A growing number of organizations want to better understand how to properly grow and implement a User Experience practice. While there is a general sentiment that a more mature UX practice leads to organizational success, there is surprisingly little data about what constitutes UX maturity. This case study describes the first steps into an empirically derived maturity model and describes what we've learned from interviewing seasoned UX professionals and surveying practitioners from dozens of organizations. Preliminary results indicate that our empirically-based approach is understandable and flexible enough to be applied across a broad range of organizations and industries. Ultimately, our objective is to move the practice of assessing UX maturity from snake-oil to science. To do so, we aim to identify the variables that differentiate immature from mature UX practices and establish a link between UX maturity and company success.

Peer feedback is a central activity for project-based design education. The prevalence of devices carried by students and the emergence of novel peer feedback systems enables the possibility of collecting and sharing feedback immediately between students during class. However, pen and paper is thought to be more familiar, less distracting for students, and easier for instructors to implement and manage. To evaluate the efficacy of in-class digital feedback systems, we conducted a within-subjects study with 73 students during two weeks of a game design course. After short student presentations, while instructors provided verbal feedback, peers provided feedback either on paper or through a device. The study found that both methods yielded comments of similar quality and quantity, but the digital approach provided additional ways for students to participate and required less effort from the instructors. While both methods produced similar behaviors, students held inaccurate perceptions about their behavior with each method. We discuss design implications for technologies to support in-class feedback exchange.

For massive programming classrooms, recent advances in program synthesis offer means to automatically grade and debug student submissions, and generate feedback at scale. A key challenge for synthesis-based autograders is how to design personalized feedback for students that is as effective as manual feedback given by teachers today.

We identified five types of teacher hints that can also be generated by program synthesis. These hints describe transformations, locations, data, behavior, and examples. We describe our implementation of three of these hint types. This work paves the way for future deployments of automatic, pedagogically-useful programming hints driven by program synthesis.

Gestures From the Point of View of an Audience: Towards Anticipatable Interaction of Presenters With 3D Content.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025641,8,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p5284.pdf,"
Presenting content to an audience is important in several fields, including education, marketing, and entertainment. Therefore, the main goal of the presenter is to transport messages to the audience. The paper aims to improve the process of message transportation by providing audience-friendly and anticipatable gestures for the presenter to be used for 3D interaction with the content. For this purpose, we first gathered input from a potential audience through a Wizard of Oz experiment and implemented three coherent gesture sets using the Kinect. We conducted an online survey to evaluate the hypotheses regarding the anticipation rate and perceived user experience. In particular, two of our three gesture sets show tendencies to be intuitively predictable by an untrained, uninformed audience. As the three sets differ significantly in the anticipation level, we conclude that future improvements of such gestures would enhance the audience's ability to predict the intended actions even further.

Bias is a common problem in today's media, appearing frequently in text and in visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists --those who are motivated to effect change related to some topic, need better methods to identify and counteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases in mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that supports identification of, and action on bias in visual news media. In particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling activists to inform the public of bias and take action by engaging people in conversation with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform that explores the impressions that activists had of our tool, and how people reacted and engaged with online bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by discussing design and implication of our findings for creating future systems to identify and counteract the effects of news bias.

Traditional interfaces are continuously being replaced by mobile, wearable, or pervasive interfaces. Yet when it comes to the input and output modalities enabling our interactions, we have yet to fully embrace some of the most natural forms of communication and information processing that humans possess: speech, language, gestures, thoughts. Very little HCI attention has been dedicated to designing and developing spoken language, acoustic-based, or multimodal interaction techniques, especially for mobile and wearable devices. In addition to the enormous, recent engineering progress in processing such modalities, there is now sufficient evidence that many real-life applications do not require 100% accuracy of processing multimodal input to be useful, particularly if such modalities complement each other. This multidisciplinary, one-day workshop will bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to analyze the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions especially with mobile and wearable devices, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech, acoustic, and multimodal processing.

Loyalty cards are a form of tracking and recording technology (TRT) that enables retailers to collect data about their customers' demographic and purchase behaviours. As recompense for sharing their data consumers receive 'loyalty points' which they can redeem for exclusive discounts and rewards. The design of loyalty schemes, and TRTs more generally, plays a key role in defining the economic terms of that exchange, and ultimately the economic value of personal data. In this paper we present findings from an interview study with 12 loyalty cardholders in the UK explicating the ways in which they create (and lose) value through the everyday practice of shopping with loyalty cards and the orientations associated with them. Based on our findings we suggest cardholders are less concerned with the protection of their privacy than with leveraging its value, only some of which was economic. We provide design guidelines for TRTs that may enable consumers to derive greater value from the data they produce and share.

Understanding the factors that persuade backers to donate to research projects has become increasingly important with the rising popularity of scientific crowdfunding. Although there are many similarities between enterprise and scientific crowdfunding, some factors differentiate these two forms of crowdfunding. One such factor is the use of endorsements. The endorsement helps backers gain trust based on expert opinions about the competency of the researchers and the usefulness of the projects. We analyzed 810 endorsements from scientific campaigns posted on Experiment.com and derived a taxonomy of topics discussed in the endorsements. A regression analysis revealed that when endorsers explained the skills of the campaign owners, the probability of success of the campaign improved; on the contrary, when endorsers reiterated the goal of the project, the campaign was less likely to succeed. We conclude with design implications formulated from our findings to better support scientific crowdfunding.

We present GhostID, a capacitive sensor that can differentiate the origins of multiple simultaneous touches. Our approach analyzes the signal ghosting, already present as an artifact in a frequency-division touch controller, to differentiate touches from the same hand or different hands of a single user (77% reliability at 60 fps) or from two different users (95% reliability at 60 fps). In addition to GhostID, we also develop a framework of user-differentiation capabilities for touch input devices, and illustrate a set of interaction techniques enabled by GhostID.

Myriadhub: Efficiently scaling personalized email conversations with valet crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025954,6,https://d.ucsd.edu/srk/papers/2017/MyriadHub-CHI2017.pdf,"
Email has scaled our ability to communicate with large groups, but has not equivalently scaled our ability to listen and respond. For example, emailing many people for feedback requires either impersonal surveys or manual effort to hold many similar conversations. To scale personalized conversations, we introduce techniques that exploit similarities across conversations to recycle relevant parts of previous conversations. These techniques reduce the authoring burden, save senders' time, and maintain recipient engagement through personalized responses. We introduce MyriadHub, a mail client where users start conversations and then crowd workers extract underlying conversational patterns and rules to accelerate responses to future similar emails. In a within-subjects experiment comparing MyriadHub to existing mass email techniques, senders spent significantly less time planning events with MyriadHub. In a second experiment comparing MyriadHub to a standard email survey, MyriadHub doubled the recipients' response rate and tripled the number of words in their responses.

We propose technology to enable a new medium of expression, where video elements can be looped, merged, and triggered, interactively. Like audio, video is easy to sample from the real world, but hard to segment into clean reusable elements. Reusing a video clip means non-linear editing, and compositing with novel footage. The new context dictates how carefully a clip must be prepared, so our end-to-end approach enables previewing and easy iteration. We convert static-camera videos into loopable sequences, synthesizing them in response to simple end-user requests. This is hard because a) users want essentially semantic-level control over the synthesized video content, and b) automatic loop-finding is brittle and leaves users limited opportunity to work through problems. We propose a human-in-the-loop system where adding effort gives the user progressively more creative control. Artists help us evaluate how our trigger interfaces can be used for authoring of videos and video-performances.

We surveyed 97 P2PM users and interviewed 22 of 58 who reported going OOM. We did not find any evidence of predisposing personality factors for OOM activity; instead, it seems to be a rational response to circumstances, with a variety of situationally rational motivations at play, such as liking the transaction partner and trusting that good quality repeat transactions will occur in the future.

This study examines the relationship between psychological wellbeing and perceived social support received from friends, differentiating groups of friends based on the communication modality the individual uses to communicate with them. Three communication modalities were examined: friends that communicate 1) only face-to-face, 2) only through computer-mediated communication, or 3) both. Results from a survey (N= 283) indicate that sociability, a dimension of extraversion, moderates the effect of communication modality on perceived social support. Social support-regardless of modality-increases positive affect, but only support from friends communicated with face-to-face is associated with lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of life satisfaction in comparison to support received from friends that only communicate through mediated means.

A high-level approach towards end user development in the IoT,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053157,22,,"
Programming environments for end-user personalization in the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly common. They allow users to define simple IoT applications, i.e., connections between different IoT devices and services. Unfortunately, the adopted representation models are highly technology-dependent, e.g., they often categorize devices and services by manufacturer or brand. Such an approach is not suitable to face the expected growth of the IoT, nor it allows to adapt to yet undiscovered IoT services. In this paper, we present a generic and technology-independent representation for IoT end-user programming environments. The aim of this ``high-level' representation is to allow end-users to create abstract IoT applications that adapt to different contextual situations. We preliminary evaluated the representation by comparing it with the one used by existing programming environments in a user study with 10 participants. Results show that the representation is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT applications more correctly and quickly.

We explore how users approach and define personal space on large, public displays. Our results show that users of public displays use one of two strategies for visual search tasks: minimizers create a small window and work up close to the display, and maximizers expand content to its full resolution and work at a distance. We show that these interaction styles match predicted 'personal' and 'subtle' interaction zones, characterize typical width and height requirements for these interactions, and show that these requirements are independent of the on-screen content's dimensions. Finally, we suggest practical guidelines for defining workspaces during personal and subtle interaction on large, public displays.

Musical ensemble between human musicians and computers is a challenging task. We achieve this with a concert-quality synchronization using machine learning. Our system recognizes the position in a given song from the human performance using the microphone and camera inputs, and responds in real-time with audio and visual feedback as a music ensemble. We address three crucial requirements in a musical ensemble system. First, our system interacts with human players through both audio and visual cues, the conventional modes of coordination for musicians. Second, our system synchronizes with human performances while retaining its intended musical expression. Third, our system prevents failures during a concert due to bad tracking, by displaying an internal confidence measure and allowing a backstage human operator to ""intervene"" if the system is unconfident. We show the feasibility of the system with several experiments, including a professional concert.

HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness. The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.

In this paper, we present preliminary results of a user research study investigating factors with high potential impact on user experience (UX) of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The study was conducted in Singapore with 29 participants in 10 sessions, each one lasting around 2 hours. Participants conveyed their requirements verbally, as well as visually through sketching. The extensive rounds of discussions revealed an underlying trend of general mistrust towards AVs expressed in three requirement categories concerning: safety, empowerment and interaction style. In response to these requirements, designers need to ensure the vehicle's reliability is ""expressed"" in users' ""language"", passengers are allowed to have some decision power during navigation (despite the car being autonomous) and are able to interact with the AV in a flexible, easy and straightforward manner. We believe such design decisions would be beneficial to generate more trust towards AVs and improve the overall UX.

Participants were asked whether they were experiencing a flat, cylindrical or rectangular shape. In one condition, a vibrotactile stimulus simulated increasing friction towards the visible edge of the rectangular prism, with a sudden drop-off when this edge was crossed by the finger. Results suggest that presenting an image of a rectangular prism, and applying vibrotactile friction, particularly on a cylindrical display, significantly increased participant ratings stating that they were experiencing a physical rectangular shape.

We then designed a prototype application called Block Party that addresses a number of limitations of Google Maps for this purpose, and evaluated it in a second replica study. The results suggested that application designs that facilitate switching among distinct but synchronized navigation views such as Block Party might support more efficient usage and the selection of task-appropriate views, leading to better overall spatial awareness.

This abstract introduces a set of tools for electronic textile crafts. The goal is to combine established textile craft routines with electronic functionalities while avoiding being limited to either crafting or engineering qualities. A discipline's toolset is decisive in what material can be handled and what output can be produced as well as the skills needed to handle it. New tools presented here allow for new interactions with materials and make new routines accessible to the processes of electronic making and textile crafting, potentially being inclusive to new user groups in the respective fields. Here, traditional needlecraft tools are adapted to integrate electric engineering needs. Functionally, these tools augment processes of textile crafting with information about electric properties of the artifact in production. More broadly, they are a chance to reflect on the roles and cultural assumptions of the technologies, and indeed crafts, that these tools enable.

The goal of this study is to understand how instructors naturally interact with analytic dashboards through an empirical analysis. To accomplish this, data of 14 instructors from three institutions that used TrACE from Spring 2015 to Spring 2016 was collected. Data was analyzed to identify frequency of analytic visits, duration of analytic use, differences in analytic use, and differences in use between semesters. Instructors demonstrated preferences for some analytics over others, but the majority of teachers generate short sessions that may not allow for in-depth exploration in analytics. Finally, instructor activity is not always consistent between semesters. Focus groups were conducted to explore motivations behind these findings and future work includes developing LA that address discovered issues.

Everything's cool: Extending security warnings with thermal feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053127,20,,"
Today's web security warnings often rely on visual cues such as colour, e.g., red URL highlighting indicates a security risk. However, such cues often go unnoticed by users and, even when noticed, are ignored. Our aim is to investigate the potential for using other modalities to improve comprehension of, and adherence to, security warnings, starting with thermal feedback. Thermal stimulation has inherent links to emotion and danger, so may provide unique advantages over current visual cues. However, interpretation of feedback varies, so research is needed to measure associations. We used an online questionnaire (n=45) and lab study (n=12) to investigate whether people associate a particular temperature range with different states of web security. Our results indicate that people generally associate a cold temperature with a secure page and warm with an insecure page, findings we will take forward into future work on the effect of thermal feedback on security-related behaviour

The aim of this one-day workshop is precisely to investigate mechanisms which give more exposure to those values in computing that are less frequently considered.

While it has been well established that incorporating landmarks into route descriptions enhances understanding and performance of wayfinding, only a very few available systems make use of them. This is primarily due to the fact that landmark data is often not available, and the creation of the data is connected to tedious manual labor. Prior work explored crowd-sourced approaches to collect landmark data, but most of that work focused on explicit user input to gather the data. In this paper, we presented our work towards a system to automatically infer suitable landmarks for pedestrian navigation instructions from mobile eye-tracking data. By matching the video feed of the scene camera of a head-mounted eye tracker to Google Street View imagery, our system is able to cluster the visual attention of the users and extract suitable landmarks from it.

Password policies were originally designed to make users pick stronger passwords. However, research has shown that they often fail to achieve this goal. In a systematic audit of the top 100 web sites in Germany, we explore if diversity in current real-world password policies prevents password reuse. We found that this is not the case: we are the first to show that a single password could hypothetically fulfill 99% of the policies under consideration. This is especially problematic because password reuse exposes users to similar risks as weak passwords. We thus propose a new approach for policies that focuses on password reuse and respects other websites to determine if a password should be accepted. This re-design takes current user behavior into account and potentially boosts the usability and security of password-based authentication.

Users prefer subtle micro hand gestures to ensure safe cycling while maintaining a flexible controllability. We also implemented a wearable prototype that recognizes these gestures. In our evaluation, the prototype shows an average of 92% accuracy while showing similar response time to existing mechanical inputs.

Previous research exploring the effect of listening to background music during tasks has shown that while such music may have a positive effect on emotional state, it can disrupt reading and memory-based tasks. This paper explores the effects of nature soundscapes on mood and performance. A diary study of the use of soundscapes whilst studying suggests that students view such soundscapes as: aiding focus whilst studying; creating feelings of calm and peace; helping to manage stress and anxiety; and hiding distracting sounds. A second study -- an experiment -- investigated the effects of nature soundscapes on mood and performance. Whilst we found no effect of soundscapes on mood and arousal during the task, our results demonstrate that high acoustic variation in a soundscape may cause a disruption to serial recall tasks. The implications of our findings suggest that nature soundscapes with high acoustic variation may be detrimental to task performance compared to working in silence for serial based thinking tasks.

A community rather than a union: Understanding self-organization phenomenon on Mturk and how it impacts Turkers and requesters,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053150,19,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinyi-Wang-8/publication/316615484_A_Community_Rather_Than_A_Union_Understanding_Self-Organization_Phenomenon_on_MTurk_and_How_It_Impacts_Turkers_and_Requesters/links/59af093baca2720370735ee8/A-Community-Rather-Than-A-Union-Understanding-Self-Organization-Phenomenon-on-MTurk-and-How-It-Impacts-Turkers-and-Requesters.pdf,"
This paper aims to understand the self-organization phenomenon among the workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a well-known crowdsourcing platform. Specifically, we explored 1) why MTurk workers self-organize into online communities (Turker communities), and 2) how the workers' self-organization impacts the requesters and 3) the workers. In the first study, we conducted a field experiment by advertising the same survey tasks on both MTurk and on Turker communities. In the second study, we interviewed two founders of the Turker communities. The results suggest that 1) workers' main motivation to participate in communities is to ""find good HITs"". 2) For requesters, there is no indication of differences in work quality between the tasks posted on MTurk and the ones advertised on Turker communities. 3) For workers, participation in Turker communities is associated with higher income, controlled for working hours. We also learned from the interviews about why founders built the communities and their future plans.

Personal assistants such as Siri have changed the way people interact with computers by introducing virtual assistants that collaborate with humans through natural speech-based interfaces. However, relying on speech alone as the medium of communication can be a limitation; non-verbal aspects of communication also play a vital role in natural human discourse. Thus, it is necessary to identify the use of gesture and other non-verbal aspects in order to apply them towards the development of computer systems. We conducted an exploratory study to identify how humans use gesture and speech to communicate when solving collaborative tasks. We highlight differences in gesturing strategies in the presence/absence of speech and also show that the inclusion of gesture with speech resulted in faster task completion times than with speech alone. Based on these results, we present implications for the design of gestural and multimodal interactions.

Interactive diagrams are expensive to build, requiring significant programming experience. The cost of building such diagrams often prevents novice programmers or non-programmers from doing so. In this paper, we present user-guided techniques that transform a static diagram into an interactive one without requiring the user to write code. We also present a tool called EDDIE that prototypes these techniques. We evaluate EDDIE through: (1) a case study in which we use EDDIE to implement existing real-world diagrams from the literature and (2) a usability session with target users in which subjects build several diagrams in EDDIE and provide feedback on EDDIE's user experience. Our experiments demonstrate that EDDIE is usable and expressive, and that EDDIE enables real-world diagrams to be implemented without requiring programming expertise.

Three play tests highlighted the users' interest and issues with the historical content, the way this content is represented, and the players' responses to the interactions and motivating mechanisms of the application. Results show that the board game helped capture important design preferences and problems, ensuring the improvement of our scenario.

The recent proliferation of a reality TV genre that focusses on welfare recipients has led to concerns that prime-time media experiences are exacerbating misconceptions, and stifling critical debate, around major societal issues such as welfare reform and poverty. Motivated by arguments that 'second screening' practices offer opportunities to engage viewers with issues of political concern, we describe the design and evaluation of two smartphone apps that facilitate and promote more critical live-viewing of reality TV. Our apps, Spotting Guide and Moral Compass, encourage users to identify, categorise, tag and filter patterns and tropes within reality TV, as well as reinterpret social media posts associated with their broadcast. We show that such interactions encourage critical thinking around typical editing and production techniques and foster co-discussion and reflection amongst viewers. We discuss, more broadly, how these interactions encourage users to identify the wider consequences and framings of reality TV, and offer implications and considerations for design that provokes criticality and reflection in second screening contexts.

Touch latency has been shown to deteriorate users' performances at levels as low as 25 ms, but this was tested only in short experimental sessions. Real life usage of touchscreens covers much longer periods. It provides training which could lead to reduce the impact of latency. We investigate users' ability to compensate for touch latency with training. Two groups of participants were trained on a tracking task during ten different days over two weeks with either high or low latency. The gap of performances between the two groups, observed at the beginning of the experiment, was reduced by 54 % after training. Users can thus compensate for latency, at least partially. These results nuance the negative effects of touch latency reported in previous work. They suggest that long-term studies could provide better insights on users' behaviors when dealing with touch latency.

Transgender individuals frequently report negative experiences when attempting to access gender segregated areas, such as toilets. This includes physical and verbal harassment and being denied access to facilities. The existing applications used to locate gender-neutral toilets are limited by the few facilities available. Our research shows that many transgender individuals feel more comfortable using gendered toilets in the presence of people who support gender diversity.

Independent navigation is important to individuals who are blind and visually impaired (VI). Researchers have long explored how blind and VI people navigate to inform the design of more useful, accessible wayfinding devices. However, there has been little research on the role language plays in providing effective Text-to-Speech directions for this population. In this paper, we investigate the language and cues expressed in written navigational directions exchanged between blind and VI members of a Yahoo! Group mailing list. Through qualitative analysis, we unpack the types of and frequencies of information exchanged, including how distances are represented, how direction is indicated, and what landmarks are referenced. We notably found that written directions often included warnings about when a navigator may have gone too far, which alternate routes are easier to navigate, and how welcoming and accessible destinations might be for people with disabilities.

Television companion apps on tablets and smartphones provide interactive content synchronized with TV shows. A key design question raised by this novel, multi-display, multimedia interface is whether the app's role is to be a synopsis of the show or a supplement. In other words, should the app help viewers better follow what they are watching on TV, or offer additional enriching content to respond to interest created by the show? We developed a companion app for a documentary with both synoptic and supplementary content. A laboratory study with 28 participants examined the effect of these different types of content on the experience of using the companion and the effect on engagement with the show in terms of participants' recall. Engagement with the show was not affected by supplementary content in the app but coordinated viewing of both screens was more difficult. Design guidelines evident from these results are discussed.

As information security systems become increasingly sophisticated and reliable, humans are rapidly becoming the weakest link in the security pipeline. Technological countermeasures can only be deployed if the humans depending upon them are aware of how to use them, and hackers are beginning to take advantage of the knowledge gap that exists in this area. The recent DNC hackings during the 2016 US presidential election are evidence of this, as staff were tricked into sharing passwords which granted access to confidential information by fake Google security emails. Vulnerabilities such as these are due in part to insufficient and tiresome training when it comes to information security. A potential solution is the introduction of more engaging training methods, which teach information security in an active and entertaining way. To this end, we introduce the game What.Hack to teach information security and defense methods for social engineering threats.

Situated acts of interpretation worked as ways of building a coherent narrative and a meaningful experience. In the paper, we highlight the relationship between on the one hand the subjects' skills and motivations to understand and make sense of the technology at hand which we call material literacy, and on the other hand the specific material qualities that encourage or trigger certain interpretations and experiences. The qualities we discuss are: opacity, risk, authenticity, uniqueness, age, and hybridity.

While self-reporting remains the most common method to understand human behavior, recent advances in social networks, mobile technologies, and other computer-mediated communication technologies are allowing researchers to obtain detailed logs of human behavior with ease. While the logged data is very useful (and accurate) at capturing the structure of the user's social network, the self-reported data provides an insight into the user's cognitive map of her social network. Based on a field study involving 47 users for a period of ten weeks we report that combining the two sets of data (self-reported and logged) gives higher predictive power than using either one of them individually. Further, the difference between the two types of values captures the level of dissonance between a user's actual and perceived social behavior and is found to be an important predictor of the person's social outcomes including social capital, social support and trust.

We present WaveTrace, a novel interaction technique based on selection by motion matching. In motion matching systems, targets move continuously in a singular and pre-defined path -- users interact with these by performing a synchronous bodily movement that matches the movement of one of the targets. Unlike previous work which tracks user input through optical systems, WaveTrace is arguably the first motion matching technique to rely on motion data from inertial measurement units readily available in many wrist-worn wearable devices such as smart watches. To evaluate the technique, we conducted a user study in which we varied: hand; degrees of visual angle; target speed; and number of concurrent targets. Preliminary results indicate that the technique supports up to eight concurrent targets; and that participants could select targets moving at speeds between 180 and 270/s (mean acquisition time of 2237ms, and average success rate of 91%).

Graphical authentication resistance to over-the-shoulder-attacks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053236,17,,"
Graphical passwords offer advantages for memorability over conventional alphanumeric passwords, but in some cases they have been vulnerable to over-the-shoulder-attacks (OSA). Thus, many second-generation graphic based schemes are specifically designed to be resistant to OSA. This is often achieved by not having users select targets directly, but by adding cognitive operations to create seemingly random response patterns. This study takes the first step to directly compare three prototypical graphical password schemes to determine their relative resistance to OSAs employing a within-subjects design. We found that schemes requiring cognitive operations in response to target patterns were superior to direct selection of targets. Convex Hull Click was most secure, followed by What You See is What You Enter, while Use Your Illusion showed high vulnerability to OSA. In addition, we discuss a diversity of previous measurements, which are meant to examine security strength of new approaches. We highlight the need for standard OSA resistance measures depending on threat model needs.

A distinctive feature of text entry in Korea is that traditionally different manufacturers have developed their own text entry methods starting with particular physical layouts on feature phones that are now available as soft keypads on smartphones. This research considers the next step in this progression by studying the viability of adopting these text entry methods on smartwatches. The results from the user study indicate that existing methods can be effective for text entry on smartwatches; analysis of the data offers suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the methods.

Animated GIFs are increasingly popular in text-based communication. Like other forms of nonverbal communication, animated GIFs are susceptible to open interpretation. We explore whether people have different interpretations of animated GIFs, how those interpretations differ, and what factors impact the degree of difference. Through an online survey, we solicited people's interpretations of a sample of GIFs, and analyzed the variance in sentiment based on the emotions participants used to describe GIFs. We find diverse interpretations of GIFs, and that duration of GIFs has a significant impact on interpretation. Positive GIFs also have more variance in interpretation than negative GIFs. Overall, we show that there is potential for miscommunication in animated GIFs, and animated GIFs may be a more nuanced form of nonverbal communication than emoticons and emoji.

Shift+ Tap or Tap+ LongPress? The Upper Bound of Typing Speed on InScript,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025944,3,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/1proc/p2059.pdf,"
This paper presents the results of a within-subject longitudinal evaluation on Inscript keyboard, which is the national standard layout for Indian scripts. We studied the practical upper bound speed and accuracy as well as the effect of practice. Through longitudinal transcription task of 400 repeated attempts, we observed typing speeds for highly experienced users consistently peak close to 120 cpm i.e. 2.5 times that of fastest speeds reported in literature. Our analysis compared the lower bound times for Tap, Tap+LongPress and Shift+Tap, the three text input mechanisms in this keyboard. Among the two alternative methods, our findings established Tap+LongPress method to be faster than Shift+Tap method and almost equally accurate. Also, we derived a model which explains the influence of corrected errors and number of practice attempts on the typing speed.

This paper presents a digital relay baton that connects long-distance runners with distributed online spectators. The baton broadcasts athletes? live locative data to a social network and communicates back remote-crowd support through haptic and audible cheers. Our work takes an exploratory design approach to bring new insights into the design of real-time techno-mediated social support. The prototype was deployed during a 170-mile charity relay race across the UK with 13 participants, 261 on-line supporters, and gathered a total of 3,153 'cheers'. We report on the insights collected during the design and deployment process and identify three fundamental design considerations: the degree of spectator expression that the design affords, the context applicability, and the data flow within the social network.

Prior work and perception theory suggests that when exposed to discussion related to a particular piece of crowdsourced text content, readers generally perceive that content to be of lower quality than readers who do not see those comments, and that the effect is stronger if the comments display conflict. This paper presents a controlled experiment with over 1000 participants testing to see if this effect carries over to other documents from the same platform, including those with similar content or by the same author. Although we do generally find that perceived quality of the commented-on document is affected, effects do not carry over to the second item and readers are able to judge the second in isolation from the comment on the first. We confirm a prior finding about the negative effects conflict can have on perceived quality but note that readers report learning more from constructive conflict comments.

Technology never stops advancing. As such instructors in technology related fields must always be aware of new advancements, and prepare their students for industry. A prime example exists in Augmented Reality, a space of increasing popularity and scrutiny. However, to prototype a usable experience, students will need at the very least: 1) Programming experience, 2) 3D modeling experience, 3) an expensive AR headset.

Unpacking visible light communication as a material for design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025862,3,,"
Communication through visible light (VLC) is gaining ground as an alternative to traditional radio communication in many settings. Effectively using VLC in creative design processes may however be difficult as the material properties of VLC can be hard to grasp and therefore to use. This paper presents a design exploration where a set of artifacts was created to enable designers to play around with VLC and better understand its properties and their potential use for design. Each artifact was designed to illustrate a particular property of light communication ranging from inner workings of transmission protocols to properties of light in itself. The set was used in two small scale workshops where users played around with the artifacts and afterward were interviewed about their experiences. Interviews and observations from the workshops suggest that users gained insights into the material properties of light communication and were also inspired to think of creative uses for VLC based on those insights

Making gestures easy for imaging systems to reliably recognize often comes at the expense of user effort. But what is the impact of increasing a gesture's effort, even slightly, on user preference? We investigate physical effort, system reliability, and user satisfaction in two experiments. The first explores eight basic command gestures. Participants preferred the less effortful gestures in two of the three easy-difficult gesture pairs when they perceived the difference in effort to be significantly different. The second experiment explores two separate three-dimensional pointing and selection conditions that differ only in the movement distance required to finish the task. In both experiments, there is a significant negative correlation between a gesture's effort and its appeal. The results show the great impact that effort has on a user's willingness to utilize the system. The findings provide evidence that the trade-off between user effort and system reliability must be carefully considered to build an effective gesture interface.

Although many common tools of media making such as video cameras have become more accessible in recent years, many remain inaccessible. Cinematography, lighting and sound-recording equipment for example can be prohibitively expensive to obtain, complex to configure, and/or require specialist knowledge to operate effectively. These barriers can prevent non-professionals who want to produce high-quality media from being able to. Cinehack is an ongoing project to research ways to overcome these barriers. In this paper, we specifically report on Cinehack: Cape Town, a participatory media making project. By co-producing hip hop videos within a community for whom media making is often a ""means-to-an-end"", we were able gain insights into the kinds of support needed to enable high quality media making by non-professionals. Specifically, we highlight ways to meet users' needs by embracing informal codes of practice via experimental making and peer-support.

Willsense: adherence barriers for passive sensing systems that track eating behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053271,15,,"
Energy balance is one component of weight management, but passive objective measures of caloric intake are non-existent. Given recent success of actigraphy as a passive objective measure of the physical activity construct that relieves participants of the burden of biased self-report, researchers are aiming to find a passive objective measure of caloric intake to improve understanding of problematic eating behaviors in obese and non-obese participants. Passive sensing food intake systems have failed to go beyond the lab and into behavioral research in part due to low adherence to wearing passive monitoring systems. This paper presents preliminary results in obese and non-obese participants performing structured and unstructured eating experiments to understand wearable adherence as affected by: 1) perceived data privacy; 2) stigma of wearing devices; 3) comfort. Wearables examined include neck- and wrist-worn sensors, and video camera-based systems.

The backbone of the project is to pursue an alternative constructivist pedagogical model for learning canine anatomy. The main focus of the study was to identify and assemble bones in the live-animal orientation, using real thoracic limb bones in a bone box and digital pelvic limb bones in the Anatomy Builder VR. Eleven college students participated in the study. The pilot study showed that participants most enjoyed interacting with anatomical contents within the VR program. Participants spent less time assembling bones in the VR, and instead spent a longer time tuning the orientation of each VR bone in the 3D space. This study showed how a constructivist method could support anatomy education while using virtual reality technology in an active and experiential way.

Previous research has shown that sketch-based input is efficient and preferable in the context of algebraic equation solving. However, research has not been conducted to evaluate whether this holds true when involving geometry input to facilitate quantitative problem-solving. We developed a bimodal (graphing geometric shapes and writing algebraic expressions) user interface, in order to conduct a within-subject, controlled experiment with 24 college students and varied two types of geometry input: 1) sketch-based input and 2) structured input. The sketch-based input was significantly faster than the structured input, but there were no significant differences based on perception and cognition. However, after a post-hoc analysis, we found a significant interaction effect on perception between prior knowledge and geometry input. Novice students preferred the sketch-based input, but advanced students preferred the structured input. Our study implies that natural sketch-based input may be less preferable than structured input for geometry-based interfaces toward math problem-solving.

In doing so, older adults will have an opportunity to enhance their craft artifacts to best fit their health needs. The purpose of this needs assessment, including 8 hours of observation and 2 hours of beta testing, is to understand how older adults might use maker technology in their crafts and hobbies to positively impact their health. By facilitating beta testing and observing local crafting groups of older adults, we identified crafting activities that older adults participate in and learned how to best tailor technology to their crafts.

We retrieved over 72,000 Reddit comments posted between January to July 2016 for a mixed-methods study of AAPI identity work, analyzing discursive patterns of user-deleted and banned comments. We found that while conservative AAPIs tend to comment anonymously more frequently, progressive AAPIs are less likely to ban comments that did not fit the behavior and norms of their community. AAPI redditors engage differently between conservative and progressive online communities through a process of what we conceptualize as identity work as deliberation.

Our technique displays a pointer on the screen corresponding to the position of the hand, which is detected by the built-in back camera of the smartphone. The user can move the pointer by moving the hand in a thumbs-up position. The user can also select a target by folding the thumb, similarly to pushing a joystick button. Our technique can be implemented using only a smartphone with a built-in back camera; therefore, it is easy to apply to target selection in mobile VR environments. To test the feasibility of the design, we prototyped a proof-of-concept implementation. Furthermore, we developed a game using our technique and investigated user impressions.

In contrast, we envision a smartphone that senses touch input on the whole device. Through interviews with experienced interaction designers, we elicited interaction methods to address touch input limitations from a different perspective. In this work, we focus on the interview results and present a smartphone prototype which senses touch input on the whole device. It has dimensions similar to regular phones and can be used to evaluate presented findings under realistic conditions in future work.

Over the years, toolkits have been designed to facilitate the rapid prototyping of novel designs for graphical user interfaces, physical computing, fabrication, tangible interfaces and ubiquitous computing. However, although evaluation methods for HCI are widely available, particular techniques and approaches to evaluate technical toolkit research are less well developed. Moreover, it is unclear what kind of contribution and impact technical toolkits can bring to the larger HCI community. In this workshop we aim to bring together leading researchers in the field to discuss challenges and opportunities to develop new methods and approaches to design, evaluate, disseminate and share toolkits. Furthermore, we will discuss the technical, methodological and enabling role of toolkits for HCI research.

'It's More Fun With My Phone' A Replication Study of Cell Phone Presence and Task Performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3048418,12,https://cogsci.mindmodeling.org/2017/papers/0501/paper0501.pdf,"
A couple of widely-cited studies have found that presence of cell phones interferes with social interactions and cognitive performance, even when not actively in use. These studies have important implications but have not been replicated, and also suffer from methodological shortcomings and lack of established theoretical frameworks to explain the findings. We improved the methodology used in a previous study of phone presence and task performance [8], while testing an 'opportunity cost' model of effort and attention [2]. We were unable to replicate Thornton et al.'s finding [8] that presence of cell phones reduces performance in a simple cognitive task (additive digit cancellation). Moreover, contrary to our expectations, we found that participants who were more attached to their phones found the tasks more fun/exciting and effortless, if they completed them with their phone present.

Negotiating Absent Practices and Dormant Features: Discourse as a means of shaping the implementation of a global enterprise system to meet local work culture,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026039,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erica-Wagner-4/publication/316712547_Negotiating_Absent_Practices_and_Dormant_Features_Discourse_as_a_Means_of_Shaping_the_Implementation_of_a_Global_Enterprise_System_to_Meet_Local_Work_Culture/links/5cf1ad544585153c3daa2518/Negotiating-Absent-Practices-and-Dormant-Features-Discourse-as-a-Means-of-Shaping-the-Implementation-of-a-Global-Enterprise-System-to-Meet-Local-Work-Culture.pdf,"
The introduction of a new enterprise system to an organization often necessitates the accommodation of standardized practices, which may be in conflict with local users' practices and their work culture. We explore such a conflict in an India-based multinational organization using an eight-month interpretive case study. Based on grounded analysis, we present a narrative account of how consultants, on contract for managing the deployment and making necessary adjustments, used discourse as a means of shaping user understanding about the features and practices embedded in the underlying system, which were not initially realized through the interface. Sustained user resistance to this shaping led to a negotiated compromise and adaptation of the system to incorporate local work culture. Our findings allow us to explore the under-theorized role of discursive power within an implementer-user-technology trio, and illustrate the feedback utility of user resistance in developing culturally-inclusive designs.

Local search entails looking for places, such as restaurants or hotels, in a geographically-constrained region. Within local search, it has been observed that an individual's familiarity with their environment (i.e. how well they know the area in a query of the form ""{places} in {area}"") impacts which places they are most interested in visiting. Less well-understood though is how people's information preferences differ during 1) different phases of the search process and 2) based on their level of familiarity. Through a series of surveys in the domain of dining, we explore how familiarity moderates what level of information is useful to an individual about restaurant location when choosing a place to visit. We further examine how these preferences vary between regions and phases of local search (deciding on a restaurant or determining how to go). We contribute an understanding of people's information preferences during search, building on prior research of how offline context impacts online needs.

General-purpose content-sharing platforms make it difficult for users to limit sharing to people interested in particular topics. Additional topic-based controls may allow users to better reach desired audiences. Designing such tools requires understanding current interest-based targeting techniques and the potential impact of additional mechanisms. We present an exploratory, interview-based study (n = 16) that addresses these dynamics for Facebook. We use diary-driven probes to explore general topic-based sharing across applications. We then use Facebook-based mockups to probe use cases and design tensions around adding topic-based sharing mechanisms to Facebook. We find that participants currently draw on various audience-limiting and reaching strategies to target interest-based audiences. Participants felt additional topic-based sharing mechanisms on Facebook might allow them to avoid oversharing or offending others and allow them to target improved audiences or share improved content. Usable topic-based sharing tools would also need to account, however, for participants' varied desired engagement strategies.

We report on a study with 7 elderly parents and 3 of adult children, as well as a group interview with 12 elderly living in a sheltered accommodation. Findings indicate important emotional needs on both parts: adult children's anxiety for the wellbeing of their parents at risk of falls, and elderly's need for autonomy and their appreciation for an aesthetic design. We concluded with implications of these findings for designing for family communication in this challenging context.

Moving to learn: Exploring the impact of physical embodiment in educational programming games,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027129,12,,"
There has been increasing attention paid to the necessity of Computational Thinking (CT) and CS education in recent years. To address this need, a broad spectrum of animation programming environments and games have been created to engage learners. However, most of these tools are designed for the touchpad/mouse and keyboard, and few have been evaluated to assess their efficacy in developing CT/programming skills. This is problematic when trying to understand the validity of such designs for CS education, and whether there are alternative approaches that may prove more effective. My dissertation work helps address this problem. After creating a framework based on a meta-review that carefully dissects embodiment strategies in learning games, I am building and evaluating tangible and augmented reality versions of a CT game. I plan to examine how these different forms of physical interaction help to facilitate and enhance meaning-making during the learning process, and whether/how they improve related learning factors such as self-belief and enjoyment.

Recipescape: Mining and analyzing diverse processes in cooking recipes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053118,13,,"
In culture analytics, it is important to ask fundamental questions that address salient characteristics of collective human behavior. This paper explores how analyzing cooking recipes in aggregate and at scale identifies these characteristics in the cooking culture, and answer fundamental questions like 'what makes a chocolate chip cookie a chocolate chip cookie?'. Aspiring cooks, professional chefs and cooking hobbyists share their recipes online resulting in thousands of different procedural instructions towards a shared goal. However, existing approaches focus merely on analysis at the ingredient level, for example, extracting ingredient information from individual recipes. We introduce RecipeScape, a prototype interface which supports visually querying, browsing and comparing cooking recipes at scale. We also present the underlying computational pipeline of RecipeScape that scrapes recipes online, extracts their ingredient and instruction information, constructs a graphical representation, and computes similarity between pairs of recipes.

Segtouch: Enhancing touch input while providing touch gestures on screens using thumb-to-index-finger gestures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053109,12,,"
Insufficient input modality on touchscreens causes icons, toolbars and mode switching steps required to perform different functions. Although various methods are proposed to increase touchscreen input modality, touch gestures (e.g., swipe), usually used in touch input, are not provided in previous methods (e.g., Force Touch on iPhone 6s). This still restricts the input modality on touchscreens. Hence, we propose SegTouch to enhance touch input while providing touch gestures. SegTouch uses thumb-to-index-finger gestures, i.e., the thumb slides on the index finger, to define various touch purposes. Based on a pilot study, the middle and base segments on the index finger are suitable input areas for SegTouch. To observe how users leverage the proprioception and natural haptic feedback from index finger landmarks to perform SegTouch, different layouts on the index finger segments were examined in the eyes-free. Including the normal touch without thumb-to-index-finger gesture, SegTouch provides 9 input modality and touch gestures on the screen, so novel applications are enabled.

The paper describes the involvement of users in the design process and discusses some first findings. Our experiences show that participation of vulnerable users is possible even in the challenging and taboo-related area of toileting. Supportive are a good information policy and a high level of mutual trust among the involved organizations and individuals.

Users are interrupted by an ever-increasing number of notifications, ranging from error messages, over new email or chat alerts, to advertisement pop-ups. We explore gaze-contingent user interfaces notifications that are shown depending on users' current gaze location. Specifically, we evaluate how different design properties influence notification noticeability and distractiveness. We measure noticeability quantitatively by analyzing participants' performance in confirming notifications and distractiveness using a questionnaire. Based on a 12-participant user study on a public display, we show that each of these properties affects noticeability and distractiveness differently and that the properties, in turn, allow for fine-grained optimization of notification display. These findings inform the design of future attentive user interfaces that could optimize the trade-off between, for example, the notification importance and the cost of interruption.

Synkin: A game for intentionally synchronizing biosignals,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053195,10,,"
Inter-individual synchronization of motor activity, such as gestures, posture and speech rhythm during face-to-face interaction is a well-established phenomenon. Recent investigations have revealed that similar synchronization during interaction also occurs in brain activity and autonomous physiology. However, it is not known to what extent this synchronization emerges during computer-mediated interaction and whether its absence contributes to the widely acknowledged problems of online communication. We suggest that measuring the synchronization of biosignals is meaningful for assessing emotional capacity of computer-mediated communication systems, and intentionally increasing synchronization could improve understanding between people. As a proof-of-concept an interactive real-time system to quantify and visualize the synchronization of facial expressions, ECG, EEG and EDA of two players was piloted and results are presented in this paper.

Notifications may have a disruptive effect on users and the vision of a smart notification delivery is still an open question. Alternatively to existing user-opaque solutions, we identify the lack of significant end-user personalization features as one of the main issues in the ``traditional' notification management. In this paper, we explore a preference-based approach towards smart notification delivery. By considering existing in-the-wild studies that directly involve users, we defined a set of preferences to customize the notification delivery, and we built a mobile application for their set up. We evaluated the understandability of such preferences, and the acceptance of our preference-based approach in a user study with 10 participants. Preliminary results show that the preferences were easily understood, and that users are willing to set them up.

The first is for museum studies and is designed for learners (typically museum curators, educators and designers) to learn about how museum visitors engage with exhibits in museum gallery spaces. The second supports social studies education. Findings and discussion show how a) space-time visualization can be a powerful means to support specific types of learning environment designs and b) such efforts also can produce new types and uses of space-time visualization in particular settings.

In particular, little literature has debated around the definition of appropriate design and research methods. To contribute to this debate, we present two case studies from our past research, on the design and evaluation of two FUBILEs. We use these studies to set the stage for a critical reflection on methodological pitfalls and weaknesses of the approach we undertook at that moment. This post-mortem reflection offers a critical standpoint to discuss on appropriate design and research methods for FUBILEs. Finally, we discuss design guidelines and paths for research.

Web browsing is an essential component of creativity, productivity, and recreation, but users may fall into undesired patterns if they do not realize their habits.

In this paper, we present the design and development of a prototype which collects and visualizes users' browsing histories over time. We explore the use of animation in the visualization and learn how users analyze and reflect on their browsing behaviors. Through a formative study using this prototype with 11 participants, we find that an animated visualization allows users to better reflect on their browsing habits and discover patterns of which they were previously unaware, especially when compared to the traditional history list view in most browsers. We discuss specific findings across six areas and their implications for future design and research.

Exploring coordination models for ad hoc programming teams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053268,11,,"
Software development is a complex task with inherently interdependent sub-components. Prior work on crowdsourcing software engineering has addressed this problem by performing an a priori decomposition of the task into well-defined microtasks that individual crowd workers can complete independently. Alternatively, ad hoc teams of experts recruited from online crowds can remotely collaborate, avoiding the up-front cost to end users of task decomposition. However, these temporary ad hoc teams can lead to high coordination costs during the session itself. In this paper, we explore the types and causes of these coordination costs for transient software teams in existing collaborative programming tools: a version control system and a real-time shared editor.

We present BaroTouch, a technique that leverages a waterproof mobile device's built-in barometer to measure the touch force. When an airtight waterproof device is touched, the distorted surface changes the air pressure inside that device and thus changes the built-in barometer value. Although this change varies under different airtightness conditions, our technique can measure the touch force independent of the airtightness conditions. To investigate BaroTouch's characteristics, we conducted three experiments. First, since the change in the barometer value varies under different airtightness conditions, we evaluated BaroTouch's characteristics under two levels of airtightness conditions. Second, we investigated the relationship between the sensor value and the touch positions or forces and found that the touch screen increased approximately in a linear manner.

We examine deliberative quality of crowdsourced deliberation in this paper. Analyzing data from two crowdsourced policy-making processes, we found a good quality deliberation with respect, reciprocity, and storytelling according to the standards in the theory of deliberative democracy. We identified a group of super-deliberators, whose deliberation was above the average, and low-quality deliberators, whose deliberation was below the average. The findings show that even when crowdsourced policymaking was not designed for deliberation, it can facilitate a fairly high-quality democratic deliberation.

Personal interactions using cell phones are so embedded in our everyday lives that they go almost unnoticed. We may try to protect ourselves from releasing sensitive information by increasing privacy protections, but how much can be inferred from our most basic phone usage? Using a large-scale annotated dataset of cell phone usage, we build a predictor to determine location context (home, work, commute) and social relationships (with close friend, with family) based on the clock of the phone and sequences of apps executed. Surprisingly, we show that just using this basic information we can accurately predict whether someone is at home, at work, and/or with close friends, family. We note that this is almost inevitable because it only depends on using the phone and not the privacy settings. Our results suggest that our relationship with technology gives away more than we might suspect. This presents opportunities and challenges discussed in this paper.

In our methodology, participants play the role of attackers, viewing video-recorded footage of PIN and graphical password pattern authentication input with various camera angles, hand positions, phone sizes, and authentication length and strength. Based on the data collected and recording methodology developed, we aim to provide insight into the factors of mobile unlock authentication which best and least resist shoulder surfing attacks and examine scenarios where weaknesses may occur. The goal is to identify more effective guidance for mobile device users to avoid observational attacks. We also aim to advance the methodologies used to measure the shoulder surfing attack surfaces where baselines of comparisons to preexisting systems (e.g., PINs and patterns) are not standardized. Utilizing the methodology and recordings, other researchers may build upon this approach to analyze future systems and replicate our results.

DeskWave: Desktop interactions using low-cost microwave doppler arrays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053152,9,,"
Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through a variety of commonly found materials but partially reflect off human bodies. Microwaves are non-ionizing and at controlled levels do not pose a danger. A wave that is capable of passing through materials and image humans could have useful applications in human-computer-interaction. However, only recently the full potential of microwaves for interactive devices has begun to be explored. Here, we present a scalable, low-cost system using an array of off-the-shelf microwave Doppler sensors and explore its potential for tabletop interactions. The arrays are installed beneath a desk, making it an ubiquitous device that enables a wide range of interactions such as 3D hand tracking, gesture recognition and different forms of tangible interaction. Given the low cost and availability of these sensors, we expect that this work will stimulate future interactive devices that employ microwave sensors.

We introduce Wristband.io, a smartwatch with an extended interaction space along the wristband, enabling (i) back-of-band interaction using a touchpad, (ii) a low resolution ambient watchband display for off-screen notification, and (iii) tangible buttons for quick, eyes-free input. Insights gained through a study show that back-of-band input increases accuracy and task completion rates for smaller on-screen targets.

Visually impaired children face challenges in learning spatial contents and materials, such as geometry. While many existing tools, such as string boards, or protractors with physical angle markers, can facilitate learning, these devices are highly specific. This problem contributes to low levels numeracy levels in visually impaired individuals. Addressing these problems, this paper presents Clicks, a digital manipulative for visually impaired children (KG to grade 3) that supports a range of geometry education tasks and ties physical adjustments to the device to a dynamic digital representation and additional audio feedback. The tool is a construction kit of simple geometric primitives that snap together to produce a range of more complex forms such as lines, angles, triangles and rectangles. When placed on a tablet computer, the geometry of these objects is sensed (via the capacitive touch screen and electrodes embedded in the objects) and audio feedback provided.

Sketching is a valuable technique used across a variety of industries to aid creative thought. Although the benefits of sketching are widely known, there is limited instruction for the application of sketching in problem solving, particularly in the critical phase of generating ideas. This project seeks to encourage the usage of sketching in this phase by proposing a structured method to aid creative thought and divergent thinking. To inform the design of the method, exploratory research was conducted involving interviews with creative professionals from various creative disciplines in addition to concurrent think-aloud design sessions with User Experience designers. Sketches from the Royal Institute of British Architecture (RIBA) were also reviewed to collect observations from conceptual architectural sketches. The best practices and techniques uncovered in this research formed the foundation for the design of a lightweight sketching method. The main contribution of this paper is the method, Sketching for Ideation Version 1.0, which was evaluated by five User Experience Designers and two Business Consultants. The evaluation offered encouraging reviews of the method for improving idea generation and also constructive comments for future iterations.

The term ""disability"" connotes an absence of ability, but is like saying ""dis-money"" or ""dis-height."" All living people have some abilities [2]. Unfortunately, history is filled with examples of a focus on dis-ability, on what is missing, and on ensuing attempts to replace lost function to make people match a rigid world. Although often well intended, such a focus assumes humans must be adapted, and that interfaces, devices, and environments get to remain as they are. At the same time, our built things embody numerous ""ability assumptions"" imparted by their designers, and yet our built things remain unaware of their users' abilities. They also remain unaware of the situations their users are in, or how those situations affect their users' abilities [2,3]. An important shift in perspective comes by allowing people to ""remain as they are,"" asking instead how interfaces, devices, and environments can bear the burden of becoming more suitable to their users' situated abilities. I call this perspective and the principles that accompany it ""Ability-Based Design"" [4,5], where the human abilities required to use a technology in a given context are questioned, and systems are made operable by or adaptable to alternative abilities. From this perspective, all people have varying degrees of ability, and different situations lead to different ability limitations, some long-term and some momentary. Some ability limitations come mostly from within the self, others from mostly outside the self. Ability-Based Design considers this whole ""landscape of ability,"" respecting the human at its center and asking more of our technologies. In this talk, I will cover a decade's worth of projects related to Ability-Based Design, some directed at ""people with disabilities"" and others directed at ""people in disabling situations."" Rather than dive into any one project, I will convey a space of explored possibilities. I will also put forth a grand challenge: that anyone, anywhere, at any time can interact with technologies ideally suited to their specific situated abilities, and that our technologies do the work to achieve this fit.

The rapid development of biosensors and wearable devices has led to an increasing number of quantified self applications with physiological data. However, conventional graph-style visual representations which have been commonly used for behavior monitoring and control may not be the most applicable biofeedback methods.

In this work, we explore four different designs, i.e., graphical, illustrative, artistic and ambient representations, by visualizing physiological data in individual settings. Following the Research through Design model, we compare these four designs in terms of their abilities to facilitate biofeedback interpretation through a within-subject controlled experiment with 24 participants.

However, some existing methods require the use of visible markers, which impairs the visual experience, while others require specially modified projectors.. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method that employs imperceptible color vibration to embed pixel-by-pixel data into images on an ordinary LCD display; this is achieved by fixing the luminance and vibrating only the chromaticity of the color of each pixel. We show that five different data values can be embedded and detected with adequate responsiveness for human-computer interaction (HCI). It is expected that our method will be applied to wearable tactile displays, robot controls, and other similar technologies.

We conducted a study where half of our participants used our technology setup as a parallel experience where both cycled at the same time. The other half used it to connect a cyclist with a person at home. Participants highly valued the experience and the video and audio connections allowed to them to feel closely connected with their partner. Conversations typically focused on everyday activities, rather than the activity itself. Challenges immerged including difficulties in looking at the video feed while riding, boredom during longer rides, and feelings of obligation to make eye contact.

Therefore, in this case study we focus on team dynamics in secondary school sports teams. These teams typically have to deal with unbalanced engagement due to skill level differences. This can impede the goals of these PE-classes; to raise young people's enthusiasm for a variety of sports and to teach them how to work together as a team. In this project we explore a design solution aimed at balancing engagement in these mixed level sports teams, through an intelligent system of connected light jerseys. The jerseys, iteratively developed through experiential prototypes that were used during secondary school basketball games, were able to measure ball possession and give feedback through a series of light stripes. In this paper we describe two iterations of this case study and our quantitative and qualitative findings of team engagement.

Towards cognitive enhancement of the elderly: A ux study of a multitasking motion video game,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053105,8,,"
Cognitive impairments decrease the quality of life of the elderly. Earlier studies show multitasking sedentary video games are an effective intervention. However, little work has studied multitasking motion video games which can be more directly beneficial for overall wellbeing. This project investigates the efficacy of multitasking motion video games for the cognitive enhancement of the elderly. As a response to this situation, we developed a custom-made game called Safari Move. Here we report the initial step towards our goal in which we studied whether or not elderly people enjoy playing our game. Two important game elements were studied - skill balancing methods and controller types. Our results demonstrate that our participants enjoyed playing our game, and that they prefer manual over dynamic difficulty adjustment, and Microsoft Kinect over Gamepad. Future work will use neuroimaging and cognitive assessment tools to investigate the effectiveness of Safari Move to enhance cognitive function.

Designing virtual avatars to empower social participation among older adults,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027133,8,,"
Social participation among older adults improves quality of life, reducing negative emotions that may lead to depression or premature death. The use of virtual avatars (self representations of the user) in online environments can support social participation by providing opportunities for enjoyment. These new online self-representations can affect the behavior of users in both the digital and the physical world. However, further study is needed to identify how to promote social participation for older adults through appropriate design of avatars.

Exploring the effects of strategy and arousal of cueing in computer-human persuasion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053122,9,,"
In this paper, we explore how different strategy (explicit vs. implicit) and arousal (high vs. low) of cueing influence the process of Computer-Human Persuasion. In particular, we study the impact of various combinations of text-based reminder and screen motions at different speed on the attention, comprehension, yielding, retention, as well as perception of heavy computer users in terms of the need of stretch and change sitting posture. Results suggest that hybrid cueing mechanics, especially with low arousal, were more effective and acceptable in general, while high-arousal cueing may be more suitable for less motivated users.

Warnings are integral to ensuring the safe operation of a vehicle. The use of auditory alerts and warnings has the potential to alleviate drivers' workload, increase drivers' situation awareness, and facilitate efficient and safe driving. The present study assessed the ability of individuals to react to auditory warnings. The warnings took the form of text-to-speech (TTS), spearcons at two levels of linear compression, and auditory icons. To assess usability, the NASA Task Load Index and an annoyance question were used. Participants pressed a space bar when they recognized a warning, and then identified auditory warnings by selecting a picture corresponding to the meaning of the warning. The results showed that participants responded to the fastest spearcon warnings more quickly compared to TTS and auditory icons. Responses to auditory icons were slowest compared to all other auditory types. Importantly, responses to spearcon warnings were no less accurate in comparison to TTS warnings.

News Company's Link Sharing on Twitter as Informative Advertising and Content Signaling,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027124,8,,"
As social media becomes one of the major sources of news, news companies are using it to advertise their individual news articles. This increases news companies' need to consider social media users' limited attention when they compete with a variety of contents generated by the users as well as news stories shared by other news companies. This work explores the implications of media companies' competition for limited attention from users on social media for news diversity. Using an economic model, I suggest a hypothesis that news companies are likely to share news articles with non-controversial topics to signal for their unshared news. To examine this hypothesis, I am analyzing sentiments of news articles that are shared and unshared on Twitter.

With an increasing amount of work within HCI targeting people who have dementia, it is important to understand the ways that various factors influence the technology that is designed for people with dementia, and the way individuals adopt and use (or don't use) this technology. A nuanced understanding of this is especially important given the ethical and logistical issues of designing for and with a population that still faces significant marginalization, and who (along with family, carers, and clinicians) are managing a condition as complex as dementia. This two-day workshop aims to bring together HCI researchers and members from the dementia care community, to explore three subthemes of cross-cultural and local experiences of dementia, creativity and dementia, and personhood & citizenship in dementia.

This paper explores how individuals' privacy-related decision-making processes may be influenced by their pre-existing relationships to companies in a wider social and economic context. Through an online role-playing exercise, we explore attitudes to a range of services including home automation, Internet-of-Things and financial services. We find that individuals do not only consider the privacy-related attributes of applications, devices or services in the abstract. Rather, their decisions are heavily influenced by their pre-existing perceptions of, and relationships with, the companies behind such apps, devices and services. In particular, perceptions about a company's size, level of regulatory scrutiny, relationships with third parties, and pre-existing data exposure lead some users to choose an option which might otherwise appear worse from a privacy perspective. This finding suggests a need for tools that support users to incorporate these existing perceptions and relationships into their privacy-related decision making.

BVP feature signal analysis for intelligent user interface,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053121,7,,"
The Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensor has been becoming increasingly common in devices such as smart phones and smart watches. These devices often use BVP to monitor the heart rate of an individual. There has been a large amount of research linking the mental and emotional changes with the physiological changes. The BVP sensor measures one of these physiological changes known as Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is known to be closely related to Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) which can be used as a measurement to quantify the activity of the parasympathetic activity. However, the BVP sensor is highly susceptible to noise and therefore BVP signals often contain a large number of artefacts which make it difficult to extract meaningful features from the BVP signals. This paper proposes a new algorithm to filter artefacts from BVP signals. The algorithm is comprised of two stages. The first stage is to detect the corrupt signal using a Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT). The second stage uses Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) to approximate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the BVP signal. The algorithm has shown to be effective in removing artefacts which disrupt the signal for a short period of time. This algorithm provides the capability for BVP signals to be analysed for frequency based features in HRV which traditionally could be done from the cleaner signals from electrocardiogram (ECG) in medical applications.

CUPA: Cube pal for developing children's emotional intelligence and parent-child relationship,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3048423,7,,"
Emotional intelligence (EI) development of children is comparatively an underexplored domain and is highly dependent on the quality of children's relationships with the adults and early care experience. Yet, the observed pattern of increasing parental employment is threatening communication and interaction between parents and children, hence affecting quality family time and parent-child relationship. In response to the aforementioned needs, this paper presents CUPA, a children companion tool that encourages EI and parent- child relationship. The two main contributions are: First, CUPA proposes a different approach to children's EI by combining 'interoception & deep breathing' and 'emotional check-in & review' methods to encourage emotional awareness and sensitivity, alongside various forms of interaction. Second, CUPA presents the use of ritual and routine to encourage children independence while promoting parent-child relationship, as well as healthy morning and sleep rituals. Functionality and interaction were explored with 21 participants and overall results returned positive. Additional roles and concept refinement of presented tool were discovered.

What actors can teach robots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027078,8,,"
In an age when machines are increasingly entering our daily lives, social robotics focuses on how robots can successfully share spaces, interface, and collaborate with people. Machines that fail to interact appropriately run the risk of becoming irritating and unwelcome; however, when personality and charm are added, functional machines can not only add value to their environment, but also engage, elicit trust, and foster bonds with their human partners. The central idea of this workshop is that even very simple robots, in terms of both sensing and degrees-of-freedom, are capable of charismatic interaction. Acting training can inform the development of such charismatic robots, but it is challenging to operationalize actor knowledge into computational systems. For example, people parse non-verbal communications intuitively, even from machines that do not look like people, and acting training contains explicit methodology for exploring the space of motion-based expression. Robotics researchers can gain insight on how to create interfaces that adapt the knowledge of human charisma experts -- such as actors and performers -- into robotics, developing robot social behaviors with humans in the loop. This workshop will be a forum for discussing minimal social robots and prototyping new ones. The program includes presentations exploring the social role of simple sensors and behaviors, a hands-on activity, and motivating talks from experts in the field. Accepted applicants will be invited to share their perspectives on minimal social robots during highlight talks, discussions, and a poster session. During the workshop, participants will work in small groups to craft an illustrative interaction for a minimalist robot whose communications they have designed. There will also be ample opportunities for early researchers to connect with experts in this field. A public website will provide an archive of accepted submissions and minimal social robot interaction videos in order to share the output of the workshop with the larger community.

Prior research about games designed to promote Second Language Acquisition (SLA) typically involves one of two perspectives: 1. an overview of the gaming system and its architecture; or 2. an evaluation of the gameplay experience and its impact on students' SLA. Less is known about why certain game design decisions were made or how these decisions support or inhibit SLA. Thus, game designers and Second Language (L2) educators miss opportunities to learn from each other and to collaborate effectively in the game design process. This case study outlines the design process of a mobile game that promotes Spanish proficiency and reflects on this experience to understand how specific game design decisions influence certain aspects of SLA. Results reveal the correlation between design specifications and SLA.

A close integration of human and machine has been envisioned by researchers and artists for generations, however, there has been little effort in investigating the possibility and plausibility of the idea until recent years. We seek to open a discussion on how the notion of self is plastic, and how innately we are capable of empowering and extending ourselves through technologies. Neuroscience studies show using a tool not only offers new capabilities, but also reconstructs our cognitive architecture to include the tool as a part of ourselves. This adaptive nature of the body image poses an opportunity for designing interfaces that become natural extensions to us.

The process of building an augmentation is simply to connect actuator and sensor blocks and attach the resulting wearable to the body. The current design can be easily modified to incorporate additional electronics for desired sensing capabilities. Our universal connector designs can be extended to utilize any motors within afforded power, size, and weight constraints.

Specifically, VisualLink notifies elderly of a call using notifications on large screen (TV) and wearable device with haptic feedback. The elderly then pick up the call via a VisualLink phone with a traditional-look, which automatically uses speech recognition to transcribe the call and show the caption on the screen, with interactive visual content such as images authored by the caller. In the evaluation of the prototype, participants gave VisualLink positive feedback for its ease of use and usefulness for making them better connected to their family's life.

The things of design research: Diversity in objects and outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027068,7,https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/82437562/ea652_jenkins.pdf,"
The goal for this workshop is to further experiment with a venue at CHI for practitioners of research through design to share their work with each other. This workshop, following a successful workshop in CHI 2016, will be centered upon a discussion of objects produced through a research through design process. Bringing together researchers as well as their physical work serves to gain insight into the practices and outcomes of research through design. If research through design is to continue to develop as a research practice for generating knowledge within HCI, this requires developing ways of attending to its made-material outcomes. The premise of this workshop is simple: We need additional social spaces and platforms for interacting with and reflecting upon material design outcomes at CHI. The goal of this workshop is to keep experimenting with such a space, with an emphasis on how prototyping and making in a research through design context produces design things.

Critical Experience: Evaluating (with) Autistic Children and Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027118,7,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ETm22CNscW9F3FTHBv0XW-OtdY5963f/view,"
Technologies for autistic children dominantly focus on diagnostic procedures, interventionist approaches or therapeutic support. The space of technologies for positive experiences for autistic children has only recently been explored. My research is situated in the OutsideTheBox project where we co-design such technologies with autistic children. Concretely, my PhD tackles the questions of how to assess the experiences autistic children have with the resulting technologies and how these technologies are meaningful to them. To this effect, I conceptually broaden a critical understanding of experience within HCI and develop an approach for participatory evaluation with autistic children.

Detecting life changes: Increasing opportunities to benefit from people-nearby applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053099,6,,"
Prior research suggests that individuals are motivated to use People-Nearby Applications (PNAs) to meet new people offline and that these individuals receive benefits such as social and cultural capital from their offline connections. It is unclear, however, what the impetus behind these motivations are and whether individuals are motivated to use PNAs for other reasons. To explore these questions, we analyzed a dataset of 14 active PNA users' semi-structured interviews and found that participants' first experiences using PNAs were associated with significant life events such as moving to a new area or ending a relationship. We conducted an online survey (N=142) to explore these findings further and investigate whether they generalized across a broader set of active PNA users. We confirm our past findings and contribute ways in which future technologies can detect specific life changes to increase the opportunities for individuals to benefit from PNAs.

Minecraft, an online multi-player sandbox video game, is now being used as a teaching tool for course subjects ranging from digital literature to computer science. To understand how Minecraft was being adopted as a classroom tool, we interviewed 16 teachers and 10 students who had used Minecraft inside a classroom setting. Analysis revealed three key ways in which Minecraft enables and motivates students to work towards their own learning goals: the ability to customize context, live through stories, and assume roles in the virtual world. Drawing from these themes we propose a set of design recommendations for online informal learning spaces.

Reducing cognitive load and supporting memory in visual design for HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3048430,6,,"
In the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) we have a broad range of ways to understand how our memory and cognitive load is affected by interactions in the world. The research described here aims to distil the complexity of activity theory, embodied interaction, distributed cognition and human factors engineering into a HCI framework for understanding and developing visual designs in HCI (a design methodology). To assist this process, interviews were conducted with visual designers from human-computer interaction, marketing, art and design. The designers were asked about their design process and how they handle memory and cognitive load. The results revealed a consistent effort towards understanding a target audience, the effect of the situation of a design artefact and the effect of cultural experience and expectations on design. These results inform a simpler, generalist approach which targets the heart of making effective and inspiring design artefacts for HCI.

We introduce a Stylus Knife that has a blade attached to the tip of a touch pen. This device can measure pressure when an artist cuts paper. In the past, we determined that knife pressure is important for creating paper-cutting designs. Therefore, we developed a device on a tablet computer to measure pressure when the user cuts paper. In an experiment, to confirm the effectiveness of our device, we compared it with a general utility knife that had a pressure sensor. Our test procedure was as follows: 1) our subjects cut paper with utility knife, and 2) each subject performs paper cutting using each device. For our experiment, we used seven subjects in each of three groups: G1 (practice using the Stylus Knife), G2 (practice using only the utility knife), and G3 (practice using the utility knife with a textbook). We compared the changes between Steps 1 and 2 exhibited by each group. As a result, group G1was able to apply sufficient pressure for a line pattern, while the others cut a line pattern with insufficient pressure. We confirmed that the novice subjects were able to cut paper with appropriate pressure by using our knife.

The format of conventional assessments (e.g., multiple-choice) can often make it difficult for students to be motivated or engaged, which can also make it difficult for students to perform to the best of their ability. Game-based assessments (GBA) are a new type of assessment that has been designed to address this issue. We conducted an in-depth investigation of four case studies of user experience during a GBA. The GBA was manipulated in order to investigate whether certain game features (length, feedback) impacted the user experience. The case studies revealed unique patterns in user experience for moment-to-moment changes in enjoyment and frustration. These patterns suggest that GBAs could be utilized to create both a more positive test-taking experience and offer the opportunity for students to perform to the best of their ability.

In a user study (n = 21) the performance and user experience of using visual, vibrotactile and thermal forms of feedback in the game were compared. Our salient findings suggest that thermal UI feedback is suited for presenting ambient information cues or creating an atmosphere.

Despite the ease of inspecting HTML and CSS, web developers struggle to identify the code most responsible for particular stylistic effects, due to complex DOM structures and CSS property cascades. In this paper, we introduce Ply, a DOM inspection tool which augments the Chrome Developer Tools to help developers explore complex professional web designs. To compute source code relevance, we introduce a technique called visual regression pruning, which uses pixel-level screenshot comparison to help developers locate CSS responsible for a webpage's appearance. A user selects an element, and Ply computes the visual impact of each matched CSS property. If a property does not affect the webpage, Ply hides the property from the inspector. In multiple iterations of needfinding studies, developers located relevant code more quickly using Ply. In a case study with the Airbnb homepage, Ply displays an average of 49% fewer CSS properties per element, compared to the Chrome Developer Tools as a control.

Rethinking hearing aid fitting by learning from behavioral patterns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053156,6,,"
The recent introduction of Internet connected hearing instruments offers a paradigm shift in hearing instrument fitting. Potentially this makes it possible for devices to adapt their settings to a changing context, inferred from user interactions. In a pilot study we enabled hearing instrument users to remotely enhance auditory focus and attenuate background noise to improve speech intelligibility. N=5, participants changed program settings and adjusted volume on their hearing instruments using their smartphones. We found that individual behavioral patterns affected the usage of the devices. A significant difference between program usage, and weekdays versus weekends, were found. Users not only changed programs to modify aspects of directionality and noise reduction, but also continuously adjusted the volume. Rethinking hearing instruments as devices that adaptively learn behavioral patterns based on user interaction, might provide a degree of personalization that has not been feasible due to lack of audiological resources.

Nowadays, mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, are essential items in our daily life. Further, more and more people use tablets in their everyday work for remote control, observing diagrams, performing web analytics, etc. However, the full potential of the tablet usage is not tapped yet; built-in sensors like accelerometer or gyroscope offer a wide range of interaction capabilities, which are not fully used. In this paper, we introduce Waggle -- a novel concept for orientation-based two-handed touch-less interaction on mobile devices through smart tilting and turning. Future design decisions can be founded on two parameters (movement angles and discretization), which are examined in two pilot studies. The first pilot study evaluates the maximum angle for basic rotation axis. The second pilot study tackles the discretization of tilt and turn angles. Both pilot studies are conducted and used to gain the optimal configuration for the two-handed Waggle interaction.

In this paper, we describe the use of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and floor projections to track participant movements and indicate crossed paths in an interactive art installation. Beacons have typically been used in static locations for broadcasting data to nearby mobile devices. The newer generation of beacons, e.g. Estimote Stickers with their small size, long battery life, and low cost make it easier to enhance portable objects with smart capabilities, broadcasting data about environment, location, motion, and interaction with other Bluetooth devices. In the first trials of our installation on James Joyce's Ulysses and proxemic surveillance, we chose to avoid interaction through mobile devices, instead making everyday portable objects (and the people who carry them) into 'nearables'. This enabled the tracking of human-human, as opposed to human-object, proxemics. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using small adhesive beacons to capture human-human proxemic data, and effective ways of visualizing these patterns.

Analysis, exploration, and visualization of time-oriented data are ubiquitous tasks in various application domains, all of which involve the execution of temporal queries. Prior research in interactively specifying the time component for such queries has been focused on defining temporal relationships in data, i.e., querying event sequences through ordinal patterns. However, there has been much less emphasis on how to specify time as a quantitative data dimension in temporal queries. Motivated by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), we present a formal model that can be used to represent complex time specifications. Our model is the first step in an effort to enhance temporal user interfaces that enables discrete time specifications through a visual query interface.

The study highlights as directions for follow-up research personalization, intelligibility vs representational power, limits of the metaphor, and immersive visualization.

It's more than just sharing game play videos! Understanding user motives in mobile game social media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053199,5,,"
As mobile gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years, new forms of mobile game social media such as GameDuck that share mobile gameplay videos have emerged. In this work, we set out to understand the user motives of GameDuck by leveraging the Uses and Gratification Theory. We first explore the major motive themes from users' responses (n=138) and generate motivation survey items. We then identify the key motivators by conducting exploratory factor analysis of the survey results (n=354). Finally, we discuss how this new social media relates to existing systems such as Twitch.

Dusk: Adaption and Perception in Interactive Theatre,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053334,6,,"
Our case study explores how interactive systems may influence and enhance theatre performances. We pro-duced a short play featuring four interactive systems. Using a mixed-method evaluation approach we strive to answer two main research questions: How do users (actors and directors) adapt to the technology, and how do spectators perceive interactive scenes? We found the success of using interactive systems in theater to be based mainly on how interaction is conceptualized in reference to the script. Adaptions are done on both sides -- system and user need to ""understand"" each other, and the audience's perception is not necessarily characterized by recognizing interactivity per se but ra-ther by experiencing it in a theatre play as a whole.

Opportunities to address information poverty with social search,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053167,5,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/147350/Wheeler?sequence=1,"
Information seeking is a central part of human life, and search engines are the dominant method of information seeking on the Internet. Although recent years have seen the rise of social search systems as a promising alternative, their application for populations across the digital divide that are starved for information has been overlooked. Drawing on research on social search, information search, and information poverty, we identify three dimensions of information poverty in web search, and hypothesize affordances of social search platforms that could address the details of each issue. Finally, we propose research questions and two associated studies to investigate these hypotheses.

Laugh log: E-textile bellyband interface for laugh logging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053104,5,,"
In this study, we propose Laugh Log, an e-textile bellyband interface for laugh detection. Laugh Log measures pressure on the abdomen and detects laughter based on pressure changes. In this paper, we developed a corset type Laugh Log prototype system that measures abdominal pressure unobtrusively. We conducted a pilot experiment to investigate whether our proposed system could detect laughter based on pressure changes. During the experiment, subjects viewed some funny movies while wearing Laugh Log. We analyzed logged data and observed features of pressure change when subjects laughed. Although further experiments are required, the results suggest that it is possible to detect laughter using Laugh Log.

Deformable paint palette: Actuated force controls for digital painting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053219,5,,"
This work-in-progress presents early findings on using deformable interfaces with force input to enhance interactions with digital painting applications. Our prototype uses deformation to submerge controls to represent paint pots, and emerge controls to represent nibs. These controls can then be pressed or squeezed to change the colour or size used for painting. Our preliminary study evaluates the prototype against a tablet. Early findings show participants were quicker and more accurate using the tablet, and found mapping of their input force to response unclear when using the prototype. Despite this, participants enjoyed using the deformable interface, stating that tangibility was useful for the use experience. We report these results and offer suggestions for improvement of the deformable interface.

Mobile interaction is shifting from a single device to simultaneous interaction with ensembles of devices such as phones, tablets, or watches. Spatially-aware cross-device interaction between mobile devices typically requires a fixed tracking infrastructure, which limits mobility. In this paper, we present SenseBelt -- a sensing belt that enhances existing mobile interactions and enables low-cost, ad hoc sensing of cross-device gestures and interactions. SenseBelt enables proxemic interactions between people and their personal devices. SenseBelt also supports cross-device interaction between personal devices and stationary devices, such as public displays. We discuss the design and implementation of SenseBelt together with possible applications. With an initial evaluation, we provide insights into the benefits and drawbacks of a belt-worn mediating sensor to support cross-device interactions.

A multi-interface vr platform for rehabilitation research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3048421,5,,"
With the introduction of new Virtual Reality (VR) devices such as Microsoft HoloLens, Oculus, HTC Vive etc., one cannot ignore the fact that research related to Human and VR interaction is bound to take a big leap. One of the main areas that has already gain momentum, is the area of VR based stroke rehabilitation research. Although many VR based research studies have been performed for lower and upper extremity training purposes, very few research studies are related to development of VR based research platforms. However, these platforms are usually single device dedicated, and therefore cannot be used to add another device. This study contributes to the field of HCI by achieving three major goals-- 1) explore the design aspects of VR based training research; 2) innovate the field of VR based training research by developing a multi-interface platform; and 3) inspire future researchers by providing an open source SDK so as to expand the horizon for human VR interaction. A pilot study was conducted in order to test the applicability of our platform, using 25 healthy subjects across four different interfaces. From the promising results achieved during the pilot study we are currently in the process of evaluating our platform using stroke patients at the Spain Rehabilitation Center at the University of Alabama, in Birmingham. Our findings and insights could inform future VR based rehabilitation system designs and help researchers and other stakeholders to assess the viability of using VR based scenarios for training purposes.

Building rapport through dynamic models of acoustic-prosodic entrainment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027132,5,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10042951,"
As dialogue systems become more prevalent in the form of personalized assistants, there is an increasingly important role for systems which can socially engage the user by influencing social factors like rapport. For example, learning companions enhance learning through socio-motivational support and are more successful when users feel rapport. In this work, I explore social engagement in dialogue systems in terms of acoustic-prosodic entrainment; entrainment is a phenomenon where over the course of a conversation, speakers adapt their acoustic-prosodic features, becoming more similar in their pitch, intensity, or speaking rate. Correlated with rapport and task success, entrainment plays a significant role in how individuals connect; a system which can entrain has potential to improve social engagement by enhancing these factors. As a result of this work, I introduce a dialogue system which can entrain and investigate its effects on social factors like rapport.

Connecting instructors and learning scientists via collaborative dynamic experimentation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053247,4,,"
The shift to digital educational resources provides new opportunities to advance psychology and education research, in tandem with improving instruction using theory and data. To realize this potential, this paper explores how randomized experiments can support mutually beneficial instructor-researcher collaborations. We developed the Collaborative Dynamic Experimentation (CDE) framework to address two key tensions. To enable researchers to embed experiments in online lessons while maintaining instructors' editorial control, Collaborative experiment authoring is needed. To enable instructors to use data for rapid improvement while maintaining statistically valid data for researchers, we apply an interpretable machine learning algorithm for Dynamic experimentation. We worked with an on-campus instructor to implement a proof-of-concept CDE system to experiment within their online calculus quizzes. The qualitative results from this deployment provided insight into how the CDE framework can facilitate alignment of research and practice.

Live Writing: Gloomy Streets is an audiovisual performance, realized on the web browser. Here, every keystroke made on a laptop to write a poem is captured and processed to create audiovisual responses on top of what is written. The piece is built upon a poem about feelings of being isolated from the general public and living in solitude, the comfort zone. Revealing the process of writing a poem to the audience, the writer's emotional states emerge through keystrokes and letters that are alive. Inspired by the tradition of live coding, the text written in live writing performance utilizes the expressivity of the language we speak and the target object that the code influences will be the minds of the audience. In this sense, we consider live writing to be a metaphorical form of live coding the audience's mind.

Patients can use smartphones to retrieve difficult-to-recall-from memory personal health information. This provides an opportunity to improve patient-clinician collaboration. To explore this idea, a mixed method study with 12 clinicians in a simulated encounter was conducted. A smartphone personal health record was prototyped and used for an experimental study. Communication, efficiency, and effectiveness was improved for clinicians who experienced the prototype. Study outcomes included a validated set of design guidelines for mHealth tools to support better patient-clinician communication.

SIGCHI Social Impact Award Talk--Designing for Low-Literate Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3058589,5,,"
About 800 million people in the world are completely non-literate and many are able to read only with great difficulty and effort. Even though mobile phone penetration is growing very fast, people with low levels of literacy have been found to avoid complex functions, and primarily use mobile phones for voice communication only. ""Text-Free UIs"" are design principles and recommendations for computer-human interfaces that would allow a first-time, non-literate person, on first contact with a PC or a mobile phone, to immediately realize useful interaction with minimal or no external assistance. Through an ethnographic design and iterative prototyping process involving hundreds of hours spent in the field among low-income, low-literate communities across rural and urban India, the Philippines and South Africa, we established design principles that use combinations of voice, video and graphics. We have applied these principles across several application domains, including job-search for domestic workers, health-information dissemination, map navigation, mobile money transfer, agriculture video search, and social networking for farmers. Rigorous user evaluations confirm that our non-textual designs are strongly preferred over standard text-based interfaces, and that first-time, non-literate users are, in fact, able to navigate through our UIs meaningfully.

We present Way Out, a game allowing players to navigate multi-layer panorama scenes by around-body interactions. Way Out explores the interaction possibilities of reaching out into panorama with depth. By utilizing the front-facing camera, the system tracks the player's face and infers the distance between the user and the device based on the size of the face, thus enabling depth interactions. In this game, the player can walk through a panoramic forest maze that consists of four layers in depth and drag items in physical 3D space.

We model purchase behavior as interactions between personality traits, consumption preferences and product attributes, and represent such interactions as digital traces. We model all possible digital traces using a likelihood trace graph, and determine the likelihood of an edge based on the associations between adjacent pairs of personality attributes, consumption preferences, and product attributes, respectively. In our approach, users' personality traits are inferred from their written texts, and are correlated to a canonical set of consumption preferences. The consumption preferences are then mapped to product descriptions based on their semantic similarity. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach through a case study on a real-world purchase data.

Web browsing data is the foundation of online advertising and can also be used to understand behavioral patterns of web users.

Through user studies, we investigated the level of concern with URL collection compared to higher-level profiling into interest or preference categories. Consistent with intuition and industry practice, our results indicate that most users do indeed find URLs much more sensitive than the profiles built from them. Interestingly, however, we found that a great challenge in this area is comprehension of what categorization actually means, which is essential to properly make privacy decisions when services collect categories rather than URLs. This paper also investigated whether certain categories may also be a source of privacy concern. We tested sensitivity of a range of categories. Most categories were considered sensitive by relatively few users, and the categories deemed sensitive followed a power-law distribution.

Cadaveric dissection has been the gold standard in the teaching of anatomy in medical schools around the world. Cadaveric dissection allows a medical student to understand the spatial relationships of different parts in the body in ways that a typical 2D representation cannot, due to its ability to provide an authentic learning experience which engages all the senses. However, in the modern times that we live in, the availability of suitable cadavers for medical education is low, and there is an urgent need to supplement the practice of cadaveric dissection with more sustainable and economical methods of teaching. Virtual Reality (VR) may serve as a suitable supplement owing to its ability to simulate an immersive 3D environment. However, the authentic learning experience is difficult to recreate in VR, due to the lack of design guidelines. This project is an early exploration into designing active learning interactions for learning anatomy.

Over several years, our team has been involved in participatory design of novel future technologies with people in resource-constrained contexts in India and Kenya. A key motivator is to include these groups, who often have lower literacy, infrequent access to data connections, low exposure to technology, and other constraints, in the process of shaping and appropriating devices and services. This is in contrast to what typically happens in such regions, where technologies from traditional markets (e.g., in USA and Europe) ""trickle down"" after several years. In this case study, we explore the potential and barriers of one such new platform - the Physical Web In resource-constrained contexts in Mumbai and Nairobi. The Physical Web is an open source Bluetooth-based beacon system, which aims to provide quick and seamless interaction with physical objects over a web platform. Our goal is to understand how this emerging technology might provide local small enterprise traders in these regions with the facility to quickly and easily create and distribute a simple online presence via a local broadcasting medium.

How do mobile apps keep users coming back? Suh et al. proposed that the level of burden placed on a user has a negative effect on user retention.

What is not captured is how the added benefits a system provides increases user retention. We hypothesize that both benefits and burdens of a mobile app predict usage. To show this, we design and validate a User Benefit Scale to complement the User Burden Scale, for the evaluation of benefits of mobile apps. Our scale consists of four constructs: if an app is 1) useful and informational, 2) enjoyable and enables pursuit of interests, 3) enables social interaction, and 4) has good usability and visual/ interaction design. We administered the benefit and burden scales to 347 participants. Our results suggest that benefit is more predictive of mobile app usage than burden, and our model of app usage includes constructs from both the benefit and burden scales.

Designing mobile applications with empathizing user experience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053347,4,,"
User Experience is recognized as an important aspect for designing mobile applications. Each application satisfies different user needs and hence demands for a different evaluation criteria. The aim of this study was to devise a user centered design framework to objectively evaluate and enhance user experience of mobile applications. Using the Empathizing-Systemizing theory, we conducted a user study to understand the cognitive needs of users in user-technology interactions of mobile applications. We found out that even though user preferences are varied and contextual, the user experience is optimum when applications are designed for inclusivity of both the ""Empathizing (E)"" and ""Systemizing (S)"" aspects. We have assessed the same for a few popular reminder applications on mobile as a use case to explain and validate our proposed framework. This study also provides insights into the process of evolving such a framework.

To evaluate gameful apps and games, we have recently developed a new set of guidelines for heuristic evaluation of gameful design in interactive systems, supporting the quickly growing gamification research area. Our set of 28 gamification heuristics allows rapid evaluation of a gameful system. This course will supply attendees with our gameful design heuristics and train them in using the heuristics on an example application (Duolingo). The course is structured into two 80-minute units, which will give the participants enough time to learn the new heuristics and apply them to the gamified application. Finally, at the end of the second unit, we will be discussing how to generate design ideas with the heuristics. The course instructors, Gustavo Tondello and Lennart Nacke, have both developed the gameful design heuristics and have experience in designing and evaluating gamified applications and teaching courses.

Method for understanding complex human routine behaviors from large behavior logs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3027135,4,,"
The increasing ability to collect large amounts of human behavior data can inform technology that has the potential to help people improve their behaviors and thus improve the quality of their lives. To design and implement such technology requires understanding of those very behaviors that the technology is trying to diagnose and improve. However, existing methods to explore and make sense of human behaviors are not well suited to address the increasingly large amount of data collected in behavior logs. My research focuses on the domain of human routines where I model behaviors as sequences of actions people perform in specific situations. I leverage those computational models of routines together with different visualization tools to aid researchers and domain experts in exploring, making sense of, and generating new insights about human behavior in a principled way. My research informs the design of technology that helps people be productive, healthy, and safe.

Mobile video communication helps people connect with friends and families over distance. However, it is challenging to use existing commercial video chat systems (e.g., Skype, FaceTime) to prototype new types of futuristic experiences. Existing video communication tools are limited in granting designers access to augment video frames and control them based on contextual information. Creating video communication systems from scratch can be time intensive even with new APIs (e.g., WebRTC). We describe the design and rationale of Streamer.Space, a toolkit for prototyping context-aware mobile video streaming apps. With the toolkit, users can quickly and easily create mobile video experiences for research exploration.

With the growing use of smartphones, many surveys can now be administered using those phones. Such questionnaires are called mobile survey questionnaires. The designer of a mobile survey questionnaire is challenged with presenting text and controls on a small display, while allowing respondents to correctly understand and answer questions with ease. To address this challenge, we are developing an evidence-based framework of user interface design for mobile survey questionnaires. The framework includes two parts: standards for the basic elements of survey-relevant mobile device operation and guidelines for the building blocks of mobile survey questionnaires. In this presentation, we will describe five behavioral experiments designed to collect evidence for developing the standards. These experiments cover visual perception and motor actions relevant to survey completion. Some preliminary results from ongoing data collection are presented.

""" Like"" it or not: How do Users Understand the Relationship between",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053119,4,,"
The ""like"" button on many social media platforms allows individuals to express endorsement of content. However, sites with a ""liking"" feature, such as Facebook, also permit users to edit or change the content of the original post after it has been published and ""liked"" by other users. This can be problematic if a transparent edit history is not (easily) available. In this paper, we report an online survey that assessed how individuals interpret what has changed in such a case. We tested four interface designs to see whether making the evolution of ""likes"" and edited comments more explicit improved users' understanding of what had happened. We found, that in contrast to what is displayed in current interface implementations, alternate interface designs make clearer how ""likes"" are associated with posts that changed over time. These have the potential to help users understand what has been changed in the post more easily.

Modern information workers typically juggle multiple tasks at the same time and manage these multiple task threads or working contexts through either physical or digital artifacts. These artifacts help the worker to keep track of the identity and state of the tasks. This practice of using artifacts in this manner isn't as well supported for digital representations of work contexts.

The usability of Password Creation Systems (PCSs) as interactive systems has been neglected in research compared to work on developing individual features for creating passwords such as strength meters. PCSs can include a strength meter, statement of password policy, suggestions for creating good passwords and feedback to users about errors. If users are struggling to understand how the PCS works due to usability issues, they will have less cognitive effort available to put into creating a strong password. Studying the usability of PCSs and ensuring they support users well when creating passwords is therefore an important issue. A series of studies is being conducted to understand the problems users encounter with PCSs, develop a model of PCSs, understand how PCSs should organize their supporting features, and to propose a set of heuristics for use in guiding the development of PCSs and in expert evaluations.

StreetHeart gives the underprivileged (homeless) the power to upload their artworks independently, by using a portable camera device. Approved artwork is then shared through LED screens placed around the city, reaching larger audiences. By pressing a heart button embedded in the display, passersby can instantaneously send their appreciation to the artists and further purchase artworks via an online store. StreetHeart has the potential to not only increase the self-worth of those affected by homelessness, but also bring them closer to the society.

For detecting words, we measure the bioelectric signals produced by facial muscles during speech. An electromyographic system composed of 4 surface electrodes had an accuracy of 80% when discriminating between 10 words. More importantly, the system was equally effective in discriminating spoken and silently mouthed words. For transferring the words, we used the sound-through-ultrasound phenomenon to generate audible sound within a narrow beam. We built a phased array of ultrasonic emitters, capable of emitting sound that can be steered electronically without physically moving the array.

Enhancing zoom and pan in ultrasound machines with a multimodal gaze-based interface,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053174,4,,"
We present the first iteration of a user-centred design for integrating an eye gaze tracker with ultrasound (US) machine interfaces used in routine diagnostic sonography. The aim is to speed up the interaction of the sonographer with the machine, offer a more ergonomic solution while minimizing the cognitive load and maintaining the produced image quality. In this iteration, we target pan and zoom functions. Field studies and observations have led to two design alternatives. A feasibility study of two design approaches determined from field studies is done using a functional prototype. Results from six sonographers provided evidence for the potential of a multimodal gaze-based interface for US machines. Results from the feasibility study have also led to a second design iteration that combines the advantages of both gaze-based designs.

Improving app look up speed on mobile via user-defined touch gesture,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3048419,3,,"
Nowadays, users rely on the smartphones to do all sort of things more often. On average, a normal user accesses to his or her smartphone 150 times per day. These include accessing varieties of apps for different tasks. Accessing these apps via the traditional smartphone graphic interface, the user needs to navigate the UI hierarchy to look up the target app. However, with the increasing amount of apps installed, the looking up process takes a lot of time. Using gesture shortcuts directly to active an app can largely simplify the apps? look up process but its performances were not investigated by previous research. This study evaluated the speed and accuracy of accessing target app using the user-defined gesture shortcuts approach and the traditional graphic interface. The results suggest the user-defined gesture shortcuts approach can improve the app look up speed. Additionally, detail breakdowns of speed differences, as well as the advantages of each approach, were analyzed.

"Hey, Wake Up: Come Along with the Artificial Learning Companion to the e-Learner's Outcomes High!",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053123,3,,"
Compared to offline learners, online learners' attitude during the learning process is relatively poor, and a feeling of loneliness is entailed as they often study alone. This results in a low learning outcome. So far, no examples exist for the design of a learning companion to this end. Herein we present a pioneering work on a co-existing, artificial learning companion capable of improving the learner's attitude through sleepiness detection. We capture, analyze and estimate the level of sleepiness employing a machine learning technique with the pilot study data. Then, we propose a prototype called LearniCube using a sleepiness detection model with an experimental evaluation of LearniCube.

Using games for good to address diversity in high tech,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3049279,3,,"
A constant flow of reporting documents the lack of women and other underrepresented groups in high tech. In response, companies are working to fill the hiring pipeline. But beyond filling the pipeline, statistics show women leave technology fields in mid-career 50% more often than men. Recent research on retention and work-life issues reveals key factors in women's success, which supports interventions that are being developed. The games for good movement tackles social problems and offers a potentially engaging intervention approach.

Eco-feedback technology is generally concerned with the communication of information to affect individual or group behavior with respect to environmental impact. Electricity consumption feedback, in particular, has been studied from various viewpoints to understand its effects on consumption behavior and to explore the design space. Recent efforts have resulted in a wide array of device designs ranging from individual appliance feedback at the outlet to centralized devices for home consumption awareness. However, adoption rates for these technologies remain relatively poor, perhaps due to a lack of emphasis on specific user needs. In this paper, we contribute a participatory design study to examine differences and similarities among three targeted household demographics: older adults, families with children, and students in shared housing. In addition, we present our process for extracting personas from participatory design study data, alongside the set of resulting persona skeletons and one finished persona.

SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award Talk--RUBY: Reminiscing about User interfaces by Brad over the Years,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3058590,2,,"
Brad Myers has been doing research in the area of human-computer interaction for the last 40 years. Along the way, he and his students created over 60 software systems, whose names are often acronyms for gemstones. This talk's acronym, Ruby, is fittingly the gemstone associated with a 40th anniversary. Myers's MIT Master's thesis, Incense, was one of the earliest data visualization systems. While working for PERQ Systems Corporation, Brad created one of the first commercial window managers, called Sapphire, with a number of features that later became widespread. His PhD dissertation featured an interactive tool called Peridot, a programming-by-demonstration system that specified the look and behaviors of widgets without conventional programming. At Carnegie Mellon University, he created the Garnet and Amulet toolkits that incorporated novel designs for objects, constraints, output handling, input handling, command objects, and interactive tools. Many of the innovations in these projects have been adopted by later research and commercial systems. Brad was one of the early researchers on innovative uses for handheld devices, in a large-scale project called Pebbles. Another focus has been on using HCI techniques to improve programming for novice, expert, and end-user programmers.

We present a text-message system that increases access to hot meals for homeless populations. Homeless people in the USA face several challenges, a crucial one being food insecurity. Through contextual inquiry, we found that although the homeless community is aware of various sources of free food, most of the information is spread through word of mouth. This leaves knowledge incomplete, inconvenient for those on the move, and difficult to remember. We address these issues with a system that allows homeless users and their supporters to update and receive notifications about locations serving free hot meals in a given area, using technology they already have access to their (often non-smartphone) mobile phones. The system was prototyped, and an initial round of testing was completed with a homeless community in southern Michigan.

In this multidisciplinary, one-day workshop, we seek to bring together HCI scholars, designers, artists, and curators to explore the potential provided by Design Fiction as a method to generate ideas for Mixed-Reality Performance (MRP) through various archetypes including scripts, programs, and posters. By drawing attention to novel interactive technologies, such as bio-sensors and environmental IoT, we seek to generate design fiction scenarios capturing the aesthetic and interactive potential for mixed-reality performances, as well as the challenges to gain access to audience members' data -- i.e. physiological states, daily routines, conversations, etc.

We also learned that quick and seamless transitions were ideal from the point of view of both students and instructors. We also learned it can be challenging to design a system for quick transitions between modes of telepresence that is easy for students and instructors to master while they are focused on the content of the course.

A probabilistic approach to group decision making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053226,2,,"
Large-scale judgment analysis from multiple opinions is a challenging job in terms of time and cost involved. Over the last few years, with the popularity of crowd-powered models, the process of decision making is efficiently getting done by using the knowledge of crowd. In management science, a closely related class of problems, popularly known as group decision making, is often addressed. Unfortunately, majority of the algorithms developed for this purpose work for binary or multiple opinions without taking care of the semantic meaning of the options. Moreover, group decision considers a feedback set comprising range of continuous values unlike the judgment analysis problem. In this paper, we address this problem, hereafter termed as multi-opinion group decision making, with a probabilistic approach taking into account the annotator accuracy, annotator bias and question difficulty. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying this on a benchmark group decision making dataset.

Recently, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications have become popular. Hence, designers must be trained to be better equipped to design VR applications and games. However, current VR prototyping approaches present many obstacles to design students; for example, most applications require programming skills that involve a steep learning curve for design students without technical backgrounds. A VR/AR prototyping method that involves a gentle learning curve is thus required. This study proposed such a method, and conducted a 3-hour workshop with master-level design students.

However, relatively little research has examined the surface texture of 3D models. To meet the increasing requirements of HCI researchers who are prototyping 3D forms with information on the surfaces to build multivariate interfaces, we present infoTexture, a novel rapid prototyping system that produces 3D objects both in a mesh structure and covered by a surface texture simultaneously. Based on mesh structure of 3D models, infoTexture supports a highly customizable software platform, which is applicable for seamlessly splitting freeform surface into planar pieces with a regular grid and serves as a guide for easy assembly. The key idea is to establish user interfaces on the surfaces of 3D model, which can be achieved by the programming shape of texture, the mapping pattern of texture and the interactive way with the texture.

Approaches to Successful Entry of the Ride-sharing Service for Startups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053340,2,,"
Ride-sharing can be a key factor in reducing traffic volume and CO2 emission for public transportation especially within urban area. However, it is not easy for small ride-sharing startups, which typically has limited budget and manpower, to boost the service in the early stages. In this paper, we present our on-demand service whose main operation is based on a mobile application for taxi-sharing which utilizes the users' trust network. We also explain in detail the three phased approaches we have applied in an attempt to increase the matching rate among the users. A high matching rate is crucial for survival of a ride-sharing service, because once a service fails to match customers in real-time, the retention rate falls sharply. Next, we analyze and interpret the implication of committing to each approach. Additionally, we also introduce one last method, which employs an AI agent to guarantee match making among users at all times by overcoming the time-spatial constraints.

Bimanual Word Gesture Keyboards for Mid-air Gestures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053137,2,,"
Mid-air hand gestural interaction has generally been researched as a pointing device. However, recent research has shown potential for text input with the use of word gesture keyboards (WGK), where these forms of interactions require the input system to identify when the gesture has started and when it has stopped. Previous research has had success where the same hand moved the cursor, and performed the activation gesture. In this paper we introduce bimanual interaction for gestural interaction to perform text input with WGK, where one hand moves the cursor while the other hand performs the activation. In our user studies, the bimanual method demonstrated significantly higher results than the state-of-the-art single handed method. We achieved 16 words per minute; about 39% higher than the benchmark, and with significantly lower error rates.

In recent years, many people's life style has gradually become sedentary, and therefore lack of physical activity. While there are many applications that encourage physical activity through social interaction (such as rankings, sharing, or messaging), few of them have shown that community composition and trends can help people do more physical activity. Here, we created fictitious communities with different trends to investigate how different community trends affect users. We found that most of the participants in the growth community had more walking steps and all participants in the decline community had fewer walking steps than before. The fictitious community trend displayed through the leaderboards might allow our participants to experience the process of social learning and social comparisons implicitly and then change their intentions and behaviors. The results of this study provide some design implications for building fictitious communities in mobile applications to encourage users to do more physical activity.

Chinese Preschoolers as Design Partners--Lessons Learned,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053343,1,,"
Participatory design (PD) with preschoolers is an emerging and challenging research topic. This paper reports findings from a series of PD activities with children aged 4-6 years in China. China is an interesting culture for PD, and there is a hole in PD research with Chinese children of this age group. PD sessions were found challenging to conduct in this context, but techniques such as using a familiar comic character as a metaphor, the facilitator as the drawer, and one-on-one communication in a group setting seemed to alleviate the difficulties. Based on the case study findings, the pros and cons of each tested technique in designing child-computer interaction are discussed.

In this paper, we discuss our user-centered approach in creating a game design tool prototype, GaPBIT (Game Design Patterns for Brain Injury Therapy). GaPBIT leveraged game design patterns to streamline designer-therapist collaboration when ideating games for brain injury therapy. In user studies, professional game designers expressed enthusiasm about the patterns and the GaPBIT prototype, indicating that conceptual and information tools like GaPBIT would be well received by design practitioners and help them in their work. We argue that tools like GaPBIT are promising facilitators for promoting design of games for health and could potentially be used for educating designers interested in serious games.

Designing a user interface or input method requires to evaluate and trade-off many criteria. The corresponding design spaces are huge, making it impossible to consider every potential design. Therefore, my work focuses on the use of computational methods for the design of input methods. I follow a modelling-optimization approach: understand and model the characteristics of the interaction, formulate the design space and develop (multi-) objective functions to evaluate designs, and develop algorithms to systematically search for the best design. In my projects I applied this approach to develop better text entry methods. Among others, I modelled the performance and anatomical constraints of the hand to computationally optimize multi-finger gestures for mid-air input, and studied how people type on physical keyboards, in order to understand and model the performance of two-hand typing.

Creating great employee experiences requires insight into internal business processes, as well as insight into employees' day-to-day experiences to determine where inefficiencies and roadblocks are occurring or will potentially occur as more employees are brought onboard. Low employee satisfaction may be influenced by inadequate tools, processes, and/or programs. Looking at employee experiences as they currently perform their job, provides insights into what is working well, or not, pain points, challenges, and opportunities. Mapping the 'as is' process helps to pinpoint problem areas and poor employee experiences that need to be changed. Once identified, teams can then begin to solve problems by designing the 'to be' state to increase employee satisfaction and productivity. This SIG helps participants enhance their process improvement techniques. Co-organizers present their best practices, methods and approaches, and how they use them. Participants will try a few techniques and share their own experiences.

This experiment uses a robot with remote controlled wheels that was hidden inside an art box. The approach taken to test the hypothesis was to separate users in three groups, each of these characterized by a unique form in which the robot would interact with the subjects. The three groups were categorized by its interaction mode: Proactive, Reactive and Manual. The first group found a robot that interacted with them in an insistent way, the second one only when the subject completed a task and the third one when the user explicitly requested its assistance. The experiment results are meaningful, because although there's no significant difference regarding quality of work between modes, there exists a difference in time of completion of the task, which is proof of a change in efficiency.

When people have a question one strategy they can use to get an answer is friendsourcing broadcasting the question to one or more of their social networks. For example, people can post a question via a status update on Facebook or send a message to a group chat on a messaging app. To better understand people's decisions about what media to use for question asking and answering, we interviewed 17 undergraduate students about their friendsourcing practices. We found that interviewees preferred to friendsource via group messaging rather than Facebook. They gave two reasons for this preference: (a) increased likelihood of finding the kinds of answers they wanted and (b) ease of managing self-presentational and interactional concerns. We provide design suggestions for enhancing friendsourcing on group apps and Facebook.

In this project, we propose to critically study the relationship of architecture and technology from a perspective of interaction with digital tools. We propose the use of text-mining on a corpus of architectural discourse in social media. With concepts extracted from this initial step, we will conduct a series of experiments on collaborative qualification using a mobile application. We will show how the challenge of organizing a discourse on computational process in architectural design could involve computation in productive new ways. Finally, we will discuss how these insights could enrich the future development of computer-based tools for design.

Wikipedia has challenged the way traditional encyclopedia knowledge is built and contested by creating an open sociotechnical environment that allows non-domain experts to contribute to scientific and medical knowledge. The open nature of Wikipedia has been successful in attracting readers to its medical content, but there are doubts about the quality and trustworthiness of its articles. The goal of this research is to increase transparency and trust in Wikipedia medical articles by understanding the process of medical knowledge building over time. Health-related articles in Wikipedia pass through increasing trends in editing activities. In addition, health-related articles include medical controversies that are discussed between editors. By examining the community's levels of engagement and reactions over time through the lens of Actor Network Theory and applying quantitative and qualitative analyses of actors and their relations, the contribution of this work will extend theory to offer both theoretically- and empirically-informed design principles for building and evaluating crowd-sourced knowledge environments that engender trust and maintain transparency.

Towards an Evaluation Framework: Implicit Evaluation of Sense of Agency in a Creative Continuous Control Task,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053072,1,,"
Reducing workload in a UI while still letting users feel in control is not trivial. This workload/control tradeoff is described in the literature and deserves attention in design practice. However, there is no evaluation framework for it supporting both explicit and implicit measurement, mainly because measuring sense of control implicitly is just difficult. A recently proposed implicit evaluation methodology - measuring sense of agency via interval estimation - seems promising and calls for further investigation. We studied its feasibility in a continuous control task - cinematographic camera motion - and compared a multi-touch software joystick to a mid-air gesture UI (N=8). Data was collected both explicitly and implicitly. Our results suggest that the mid-air gesture design does not increase the sense of agency. Both methodologies yielded similar results but the implicit one was more sensitive and the combination of both led to convincing overall results.

It is about taking control and making proactive choices wisely and strategically instead of reactively and randomly.

"Life as a Robot (at CHI) Challenges, Benefits, and Prospects for Attending Conferences via Telepresence",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3052761,1,,"
In an ideal world, children and adults could travel anywhere as easily as they travel to work or school. Geography has stood in the way of this, until now. This paper's authors, a design team of adults and children, discuss their experiences inhabiting a telepresence robot at CHI from ~2500 miles away through six vignettes detailing their experiences. This paper also describes results from two design sessions focused on improving telepresence conference experiences. We reflect on what these experiences and outcomes mean for CHI and telepresence more broadly. This alt.chi work will be presented via telepresence.

Phlebotomists Do It Better: Exploring Soft Interaction In The Medical Domain,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053357,1,,"
ForceForm is a dynamically deformable interactive surface in which lumps and indents can be created, and feels soft to the touch. In this paper, we present a study to explore users' ability to identify different levels of firmness generated in the soft surface of ForceForm. Our results show that those with medical training, in this case phlebotomists, perform the task with significantly better accuracy than those without a medical background and those without a medical background can achieve an accuracy similar to the medical group with five to six repeats of the experiment. We outline possible directions for future work given these results.

CanTouchThis: Examining the Effect of Physical Contact in a Mobile Multiplayer Game,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053087,1,,"
Smartphones have become ubiquitous and smartphone users have been called anti social because of the high amount of usage they frequently show. In this paper we want to examine if smartphones on the other hand might even be used to bring people. We present CanTouchThis, a smartphone game designed around two players physically sharing one smartphone to increase social interaction. We conducted a user study (n=12) examining the effects of physical contact on player experience and emotional benefits of communication. The preliminary analysis shows that playing on a shared device leads to higher valence scores compared to playing on separate devices.

2nd career development forum for recent PhDs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3108903,1,http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/2exab/ea3081.pdf,"
The goal of the Career Development Forum is to provide a supportive environment for recent PHDs (under 5 years) to discuss issues related to career development, including defining a research trajectory, identifying funding sources, getting involved in professional service within SIGCHI and elsewhere, communicating their work and strengthening their public profile, and balancing work, family and social life. A selected group of recent PHDs will interact with senior researchers from academia and/or industry. Each recent PHD will be provided with a 20+ minute slot to discuss his/her career and career development with the other attendees. There will also be a series of panels in which senior HCI researchers discuss research development, getting involved in professional service, and work/life balance.

From joysticks to Pokémon Go: Games and play research in SIGCHI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3049284,1,,"
At CHI 2016, a record number of games-related papers were accepted into the conference proceedings and the SIG meeting for games attracted almost 100 people. The games and play subcommittee remained strong at CHI 2017 and showed a variety of submissions. In addition, we see games practitioners within the SIGCHI community running workshops and taking part in the CHI conference. This SIG will continue to be an important forum for everyone doing games research at CHI. We want to engage the community in a discussion about the directions that games research at CHI should take and gather feedback about current HCI research trends for games. To expand this community, we plan to discuss current HCI and games trends, academic dissemination, community outreach, and collaborations with practitioners.

HoloARt Video Showcase: Painting with Holograms in Mixed Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3049787,0,,"
We propose HoloARt, a new media art that explores the use of holograms in mixed reality for creative self expression. We designed a system that allows the user to turn their physical environment into a canvas where digital holograms and physical objects co-exist in the real and virtual world. Users are able to virtually spray and splatter hologram paint on top of physical objects and surfaces as well as painting in the air by only using their hands. The content grows dynamically, following the natural movements of the user. The system is self-contained and does not require hand controllers or positional tracking sensors on the space. This video accompanies our CHI paper and Art Installation [1].

Comparing mid-air finger motion with touch for small target acquisition on wearable devices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053092,0,,"
Mid-air finger motion takes advantage of the vast free 3D space around a device for input. Although previous research has compared mid-air finger motion with touch for mobile and large interactive surfaces, little is known about their performance for small target acquisition on ultra-small screen devices. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of mid-air finger motion and touch as input techniques for small target acquisition on smartwatches with 16 participants. Results show that mid-air finger motion can be as fast as touch but has significantly fewer errors. No statistically significant difference has been found in either mental or physical demand while using two techniques, but mid-air finger motion technique is perceived to have better performance with less frustration compared with touch.

Studying Studying--Academic Life as the Subject of Commercial Research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053685,0,,"
This paper offers a personal view on the interplay between the multiple roles of academic and commercial researcher and classroom teacher. A series of vignettes expose a variety of lessons. Some of the vignettes are about the way that being an educator of human-computer interaction has informed my practice as an academic researcher about HCI. Some are about the different ethical expectations when using educational practice as part of commercial research as opposed to academic research. We also see how the inside knowledge of being a practitioner researcher offers unique insights into rich data and how product orientation can expose gaps in research, surprisingly not so different from the way that teaching students does: with neither developers nor students can you hide fuzzy thinking behind long words. While there are conflicts that need to be carefully managed, both academic and commercial research have powerful synergies with educational practice.

Collecting and Managing Data in Public Health Research on Autism,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053261,0,,"
Significant efforts in the CHI community have focused on supporting autism research through intervention-based work. For example, applications of mobile systems, therapeutic games, gesture-based interaction, and capture and access have been studied in the context of therapy, care, and interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. In this paper, we discuss how HCI can support population-focused strategies, or a public health approach, to autism research. Public health research is focused on collecting and managing large amounts of data at the population level in order to understand aspects of autism such as early detection, lifespan outcomes, and risk factors. We discuss a research agenda for HCI that involves opportunities for innovative multidisciplinary autism research at the population level rather than the individual level.

Phantasm: Using Player Communication as Key Source of Gameplay,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3048414,0,,"
Many cooperative games share a common drawback: they are not entirely cooperative. These games usually highlight some form of personal gain, diminishing potential for positive interactivity. Phantasm is a game where players' skills are measured by how well they can communicate together. Players take on the roles of either special agent or master hacker. The goal is to get the agent to an exit. However, there are many enemies and obstacles that only the hacker can see, through various security cameras and filters. The agent, however, can hear sounds emitting from the walls and other objects. Both players must keep a constant flow of communication in aiding the agent of what routes to take, what and how to interact with the environments, and where, precisely, to shoot at invisible threats. This game will help bring players closer, as they will need to understand each others way of thinking in a tense and suspenseful gaming environment.

Ant-Based Modeling: Agent-Based City Simulation with Ants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3049796,0,,"
Ant-Based Modeling explores the possibility of implementing agent-based modeling with living ants and external stimuli such as electromagnetic radiations, magnetic fields, and electric fields. In an experiment with fire ants, we discovered that ultraviolet and infrared lights can affect their behavior in the form of attraction and dispersion towards the light, respectively. The video highlights some of the LEGO- made landscapes we use in our explorations and how the behavior of ants can be influenced by ultraviolet light to achieve certain purposes such as exploring a new area or dragging a ping pong ball to a specific location. These experiments have allowed us to learn more about ants and have inspired us to explore novel forms of human-ant interaction.
