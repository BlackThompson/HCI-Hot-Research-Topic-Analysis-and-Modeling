Co-Writing Screenplays and Theatre Scripts with Language Models: Evaluation by Industry Professionals,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581225,34,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581225,"
 Language models are increasingly attracting interest from writers. However, such models lack long-range semantic coherence, limiting their usefulness for longform creative writing. We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically, in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals. Participants co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections both from our interviewees and from independent reviewers who critiqued performances of several of the scripts to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation could be useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations—including plagiarism and bias—and participatory models for the design and deployment of such tools.

Co-writing with opinionated language models affects users' views,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581196,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581196,"
 If large language models like GPT-3 preferably produce a particular point of view, they may influence people’s opinions on an unknown scale. This study investigates whether a language-model-powered writing assistant that generates some opinions more often than others impacts what users write – and what they think. In an online experiment, we asked participants (N=1,506) to write a post discussing whether social media is good for society. Treatment group participants used a language-model-powered writing assistant configured to argue that social media is good or bad for society. Participants then completed a social media attitude survey, and independent judges (N=500) evaluated the opinions expressed in their writing. Using the opinionated language model affected the opinions expressed in participants’ writing and shifted their opinions in the subsequent attitude survey. We discuss the wider implications of our results and argue that the opinions built into AI language technologies need to be monitored and engineered more carefully.

Why Johnny can't prompt: how non-AI experts try (and fail) to design LLM prompts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581388,16,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581388,"
Pre-trained large language models (“LLMs”) like GPT-3 can engage in fluent, multi-turn instruction-taking out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for designing natural language interactions. Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.

Studying the effect of AI Code Generators on Supporting Novice Learners in Introductory Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580919,10,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07427,"
 AI code generators like OpenAI Codex have the potential to assist novice programmers by generating code from natural language descriptions, however, over-reliance might negatively impact learning and retention. To explore the implications that AI code generators have on introductory programming, we conducted a controlled experiment with 69 novices (ages 10-17). Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modification task. Our results show that using Codex significantly increased code-authoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual code-modification tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed significantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.

Evaluating large language models in generating synthetic hci research data: a case study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580688,9,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580688,"
 Collecting data is one of the bottlenecks of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Motivated by this, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating synthetic user research data. We use OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to generate open-ended questionnaire responses about experiencing video games as art, a topic not tractable with traditional computational user models. We test whether synthetic responses can be distinguished from real responses, analyze errors of synthetic data, and investigate content similarities between synthetic and real data. We conclude that GPT-3 can, in this context, yield believable accounts of HCI experiences. Given the low cost and high speed of LLM data generation, synthetic data should be useful in ideating and piloting new experiments, although any findings must obviously always be validated with real data. The results also raise concerns: if employed by malicious users of crowdsourcing services, LLMs may make crowdsourcing of self-report data fundamentally unreliable.

Synthetic lies: Understanding ai-generated misinformation and evaluating algorithmic and human solutions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581318,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581318,"
 Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human-like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation.

Algorithmic Power or Punishment: Information Worker Perspectives on Passive Sensing Enabled AI Phenotyping of Performance and Wellbeing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581376,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581376,"
 We are witnessing an emergence in Passive Sensing enabled AI (PSAI) to provide dynamic insights for performance and wellbeing of information workers. Hybrid work paradigms have simultaneously created new opportunities for PSAI, but have also fostered anxieties of misuse and privacy intrusions within a power asymmetry. At this juncture, it is unclear if those who are sensed can find these systems acceptable. We conducted scenario-based interviews of 28 information workers to highlight their perspectives as data subjects in PSAI. We unpack their expectations using the Contextual Integrity framework of privacy and information gathering. Participants described appropriateness of PSAI based on its impact on job consequences, work-life boundaries, and preservation of flexibility. They perceived that PSAI inferences could be shared with selected stakeholders if they could negotiate the algorithmic inferences. Our findings help envision worker-centric approaches to implementing PSAI as an empowering tool in the future of work.

 Despite the proliferation of explainable AI (XAI) methods, little is understood about end-users’ explainability needs and behaviors around XAI explanations. To address this gap and contribute to understanding how explainability can support human-AI interaction, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 20 end-users of a real-world AI application, the Merlin bird identification app, and inquired about their XAI needs, uses, and perceptions. We found that participants desire practically useful information that can improve their collaboration with the AI, more so than technical system details. Relatedly, participants intended to use XAI explanations for various purposes beyond understanding the AI’s outputs: calibrating trust, improving their task skills, changing their behavior to supply better inputs to the AI, and giving constructive feedback to developers. Finally, among existing XAI approaches, participants preferred part-based explanations that resemble human reasoning and explanations. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide recommendations for future XAI design.

Focused Time Saves Nine: Evaluating Computer–Assisted Protected Time for Hybrid Information Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581326,5,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581326,"
 Information workers often struggle to balance their time for a variety of activities like focused work, communication, and caring. This study analyzes the impact of a commercially available computer-assisted time protection intervention that automatically and preemptively schedules calendar time for self-determined activities. We analyzed the behaviors and self-reports of workers in two naturalistic studies. First, we studied 27 workers who were already using Computer-Assisted Protected Time (CAP time) and found that they mainly used it for focused work. Second, we analyzed the effect of CAP time as a randomized intervention on 89 workers who never had CAP time and found that those with it self-reported an increase in performance, job resources, and immersion. In both studies, workers with CAP time exhibited a rearrangement of activities leading to an overall reduction in work activity. This study highlights new opportunities for intelligent time-management interventions and the importance of protected time at work.

"Complex daily activities, country-level diversity, and smartphone sensing: A study in denmark, italy, mongolia, paraguay, and uk",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581190,7,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08591,"
Smartphones enable understanding human behavior with activity recognition to support people’s daily lives. Prior studies focused on using inertial sensors to detect simple activities (sitting, walking, running, etc.) and were mostly conducted in homogeneous populations within a country. However, people are more sedentary in the post-pandemic world with the prevalence of remote/hybrid work/study settings, making detecting simple activities less meaningful for context-aware applications. Hence, the understanding of (i) how multimodal smartphone sensors and machine learning models could be used to detect complex daily activities that can better inform about people’s daily lives, and (ii) how models generalize to unseen countries, is limited. We analyzed in-the-wild smartphone data and ∼ 216K self-reports from 637 college students in five countries (Italy, Mongolia, UK, Denmark, Paraguay). Then, we defined a 12-class complex daily activity recognition task and evaluated the performance with different approaches. We found that even though the generic multi-country approach provided an AUROC of 0.70, the country-specific approach performed better with AUROC scores in [0.79-0.89]. We believe that research along the lines of diversity awareness is fundamental for advancing human behavior understanding through smartphones and machine learning, for more real-world utility across countries.

Anglekindling: Supporting journalistic angle ideation with large language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580907,5,https://savvaspetridis.github.io/papers/anglekindling.pdf,"
 News media often leverage documents to find ideas for stories, while being critical of the frames and narratives present. Developing angles from a document such as a press release is a cognitively taxing process, in which journalists critically examine the implicit meaning of its claims. Informed by interviews with journalists, we developed AngleKindling, an interactive tool which employs the common sense reasoning of large language models to help journalists explore angles for reporting on a press release. In a study with 12 professional journalists, we show that participants found AngleKindling significantly more helpful and less mentally demanding to use for brainstorming ideas, compared to a prior journalistic angle ideation tool. AngleKindling helped journalists deeply engage with the press release and recognize angles that were useful for multiple types of stories. From our findings, we discuss how to help journalists customize and identify promising angles, and extending AngleKindling to other knowledge-work domains.

On the design of ai-powered code assistants for notebooks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580940,6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11178,"
 AI-powered code assistants, such as Copilot, are quickly becoming a ubiquitous component of contemporary coding contexts. Among these environments, computational notebooks, such as Jupyter, are of particular interest as they provide rich interface affordances that interleave code and output in a manner that allows for both exploratory and presentational work. Despite their popularity, little is known about the appropriate design of code assistants in notebooks. We investigate the potential of code assistants in computational notebooks by creating a design space (reified from a survey of extant tools) and through an interview-design study (with 15 practicing data scientists). Through this work, we identify challenges and opportunities for future systems in this space, such as the value of disambiguation for tasks like data visualization, the potential of tightly scoped domain-specific tools (like linters), and the importance of polite assistants.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes, but clinician acceptance remains a critical barrier. We developed a novel decision support interface that provides interpretable treatment recommendations for sepsis, a life-threatening condition in which decisional uncertainty is common, treatment practices vary widely, and poor outcomes can occur even with optimal decisions. This system formed the basis of a mixed-methods study in which 24 intensive care clinicians made AI-assisted decisions on real patient cases. We found that explanations generally increased confidence in the AI, but concordance with specific recommendations varied beyond the binary acceptance or rejection described in prior work. Although clinicians sometimes ignored or trusted the AI, they also often prioritized aspects of the recommendations to follow, reject, or delay in a process we term “negotiation.” These results reveal novel barriers to adoption of treatment-focused AI tools and suggest ways to better support differing clinician perspectives.

 Target selection is a fundamental task in interactive Augmented Reality (AR) systems. Predicting the intended target of selection in such systems can provide users with a smooth, low-friction interaction experience. Our work aims to predict gaze-based target selection in AR headsets with eye and head endpoint distributions, which describe the probability distribution of eye and head 3D orientation when a user triggers a selection input. We first conducted a user study to collect users’ eye and head behavior in a gaze-based pointing selection task with two confirmation mechanisms (air tap and blinking). Based on the study results, we then built two models: a unimodal model using only eye endpoints and a multimodal model using both eye and head endpoints. Results from a second user study showed that the pointing accuracy is improved by approximately 32% after integrating our models into gaze-based selection techniques.

Clinical decision support tools (DSTs), powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), promise to improve clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decision-making. However, no AI model is always correct. DSTs must enable clinicians to validate each AI suggestion, convincing them to take the correct suggestions while rejecting its errors. While prior work often tried to do so by explaining AI’s inner workings or performance, we chose a different approach: We investigated how clinicians validated each other’s suggestions in practice (often by referencing scientific literature) and designed a new DST that embraces these naturalistic interactions. This design uses GPT-3 to draw literature evidence that shows the AI suggestions’ robustness and applicability (or the lack thereof). A prototyping study with clinicians from three disease areas proved this approach promising. Clinicians’ interactions with the prototype also revealed new design and research opportunities around (1) harnessing the complementary strengths of literature-based and predictive decision supports; (2) mitigating risks of de-skilling clinicians; and (3) offering low-data decision support with literature.

 Machine learning models with high accuracy on test data can still produce systematic failures, such as harmful biases and safety issues, when deployed in the real world. To detect and mitigate such failures, practitioners run behavioral evaluation of their models, checking model outputs for specific types of inputs. Behavioral evaluation is important but challenging, requiring that practitioners discover real-world patterns and validate systematic failures. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with ML practitioners to better understand the challenges of behavioral evaluation and found that it is a collaborative, use-case-first process that is not adequately supported by existing task- and domain-specific tools. Using these findings, we designed zeno, a general-purpose framework for visualizing and testing AI systems across diverse use cases. In four case studies with participants using zeno on real-world models, we found that practitioners were able to reproduce previous manual analyses and discover new systematic failures.

 Conversational agents show the promise to allow users to interact with mobile devices using language. However, to perform diverse UI tasks with natural language, developers typically need to create separate datasets and models for each specific task, which is expensive and effort-consuming. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been shown capable of generalizing to various downstream tasks when prompted with a handful of examples from the target task. This paper investigates the feasibility of enabling versatile conversational interactions with mobile UIs using a single LLM. We designed prompting techniques to adapt an LLM to mobile UIs. We experimented with four important modeling tasks that address various scenarios in conversational interaction. Our method achieved competitive performance on these challenging tasks without requiring dedicated datasets and training, offering a lightweight and generalizable approach to enable language-based mobile interaction.

 Despite the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI), designing user experiences (UX) for AI-powered systems remains challenging. UX designers face hurdles understanding AI technologies, such as pre-trained language models, as design materials. This limits their ability to ideate and make decisions about whether, where, and how to use AI. To address this problem, we bridge the literature on AI design and AI transparency to explore whether and how frameworks for transparent model reporting can support design ideation with pre-trained models. By interviewing 23 UX practitioners, we find that practitioners frequently work with pre-trained models, but lack support for UX-led ideation. Through a scenario-based design task, we identify common goals that designers seek model understanding for and pinpoint their model transparency information needs. Our study highlights the pivotal role that UX designers can play in Responsible AI and calls for supporting their understanding of AI limitations through model transparency and interrogation.

Extensive HCI research has investigated how to prevent and mitigate harassment in virtual spaces, particularly by leveraging human-based and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based moderation. However, social Virtual Reality (VR) constitutes a novel social space that faces both intensified harassment challenges and a lack of consensus on how moderation should be approached to address such harassment. Drawing on 39 interviews with social VR users with diverse backgrounds, we investigate the perceived opportunities and limitations for leveraging AI-based moderation to address emergent harassment in social VR, and how future AI moderators can be designed to enhance such opportunities and address limitations. We provide the first empirical investigation into re-envisioning AI’s new roles in innovating content moderation approaches to better combat harassment in social VR. We also highlight important principles for designing future AI-based moderation incorporating user-human-AI collaboration to achieve safer and more nuanced online spaces.

"Comparing Dwell time, Pursuits and Gaze Gestures for Gaze Interaction on Handheld Mobile Devices",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580871,4,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/295586/1/295586.pdf,"
Gaze is promising for hands-free interaction on mobile devices. However, it is not clear how gaze interaction methods compare to each other in mobile settings. This paper presents the first experiment in a mobile setting that compares three of the most commonly used gaze interaction methods: Dwell time, Pursuits, and Gaze gestures. In our study, 24 participants selected one of 2, 4, 9, 12 and 32 targets via gaze while sitting and while walking. Results show that input using Pursuits is faster than Dwell time and Gaze gestures especially when there are many targets. Users prefer Pursuits when stationary, but prefer Dwell time when walking. While selection using Gaze gestures is more demanding and slower when there are many targets, it is suitable for contexts where accuracy is more important than speed. We conclude with guidelines for the design of gaze interaction on handheld mobile devices.

Envisioning Narrative Intelligence: A Creative Visual Storytelling Anthology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580744,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580744,"
 In this paper, we collect an anthology of 100 visual stories from authors who participated in our systematic creative process of improvised story-building based on image sequences. Following close reading and thematic analysis of our anthology, we present five themes that characterize the variations found in this creative visual storytelling process: (1) Narrating What is in Vision vs. Envisioning; (2) Dynamically Characterizing Entities/Objects; (3) Sensing Experiential Information About the Scenery; (4) Modulating the Mood; (5) Encoding Narrative Biases. In understanding the varied ways that people derive stories from images, we offer considerations for collecting story-driven training data to inform automatic story generation. In correspondence with each theme, we envision narrative intelligence criteria for computational visual storytelling as: creative, reliable, expressive, grounded, and responsible. From these criteria, we discuss how to foreground creative expression, account for biases, and operate in the bounds of visual storyworlds.

 The electronics-centered approach to physical computing presents challenges when designers build tangible interactive systems due to its inherent emphasis on circuitry and electronic components. To explore an alternative physical computing approach we have developed a computer vision (CV) based system that uses a webcam, computer, and printed fiducial markers to create functional tangible interfaces. Through a series of design studios, we probed how designers build tangible interfaces with this CV-driven approach. In this paper, we apply the annotated portfolio method to reflect on the fifteen outcomes from these studios. We observed that CV markers offer versatile materiality for tangible interactions, afford the use of democratic materials for interface construction, and engage designers in embodied debugging with their own vision as a proxy for CV. By sharing our insights, we inform other designers and educators who seek alternative ways to facilitate physical computing and tangible interaction design.

Remote breathing rate tracking in stationary position using the motion and acoustic sensors of earables,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581265,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tousif-Ahmed-2/publication/369439475_Remote_Breathing_Rate_Tracking_in_Stationary_Position_Using_the_Motion_and_Acoustic_Sensors_of_Earables/links/641b34e266f8522c38c75b20/Remote-Breathing-Rate-Tracking-in-Stationary-Position-Using-the-Motion-and-Acoustic-Sensors-of-Earables.pdf,"
 Breathing rate is critical for the user’s respiratory health and is hard to track outside the clinical context, requiring specialized devices. Earables could provide a convenient solution to track the breathing rate anywhere by leveraging the user’s breathing-related motion and sound captured through the earables’ motion sensors and microphones. However, small non-breathing head movements or background noises during the assessment affect the estimation accuracy. While noise filtering improves accuracy, it can discard valid measurements. This paper presents a multimodal approach to tracking the user’s breathing rate using a signal-processing-based algorithm on motion sensors and a lightweight machine-learning algorithm on acoustic sensors from the earables that balances the accuracy and data retention. A user study with 30 participants shows that the system can accurately calculate breathing rate (Mean Absolute Error < 2 breaths per minute) while retaining most breathing sessions (75%) performed in real-world settings. This work provides an essential direction for remote breathing rate monitoring.

Less is Not More: Improving Findability and Actionability of Privacy Controls for Online Behavioral Advertising,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580773,2,,"
 Tech companies that rely on ads for business argue that users have control over their data via ad privacy settings. However, these ad settings are often hidden. This work aims to inform the design of findable ad controls and study their impact on users’ behavior and sentiment. We iteratively designed ad control interfaces that varied in the setting’s (1) entry point (within ads, at the feed’s top) and (2) level of actionability, with high actionability directly surfacing links to specific advertisement settings, and low actionability pointing to general settings pages (which is reminiscent of companies’ current approach to ad controls). We built a Chrome extension that augments Facebook with our experimental ad control interfaces and conducted a between-subjects online experiment with 110 participants. Results showed that entry points within ads or at the feed’s top, and high actionability interfaces, both increased Facebook ad settings’ findability and discoverability, as well as participants’ perceived usability of them. High actionability also reduced users’ effort in finding ad settings. Participants perceived high and low actionability as equally usable, which shows it is possible to design more actionable ad controls without overwhelming users. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of regulation to provide specific and research-informed requirements to companies on how to design usable ad controls.

Probing a Community-Based Conversational Storytelling Agent to Document Digital Stories of Housing Insecurity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581109,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581109,"
 Despite the central role that stories play in social movement-building, they are difficult to sustainably document for many reasons. To explore this challenge, this paper describes the design of a community-based conversational storytelling agent (CSA) to document digital stories of housing insecurity. Building on insights from an ongoing grassroots project, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, we share how a study initially focused on CSA-support opened an investigation of the role that artificial intelligence may play in housing justice movements. Drawing from 17 interviews with narrators of housing insecurity experiences and collectors of such stories, we find that collectors perceive opportunities to expand means of documentation with multimedia and multi-language support. Meanwhile, some narrators perceive potential for a CSA to offer therapeutic storytelling experiences and document otherwise unrecorded stories. Yet, CSA encounters also surface perils of machine bias, as well as reduced possibilities of human connections and relations.

Video conferencing solutions like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams are becoming increasingly popular for facilitating conversations, and recent advancements such as live captioning help people better understand each other. We believe that the addition of visuals based on the context of conversations could further improve comprehension of complex or unfamiliar concepts. To explore the potential of such capabilities, we conducted a formative study through remote interviews (N=10) and crowdsourced a dataset of over 1500 sentence-visual pairs across a wide range of contexts. These insights informed Visual Captions, a real-time system that integrates with a video conferencing platform to enrich verbal communication. Visual Captions leverages a fine-tuned large language model to proactively suggest relevant visuals in open-vocabulary conversations. We present findings from a lab study (N=26) and an in-the-wild case study (N=10), demonstrating how Visual Captions can help improve communication through visual augmentation in various scenarios.

Who Should I Trust: AI or Myself? Leveraging Human and AI Correctness Likelihood to Promote Appropriate Trust in AI-Assisted Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581058,3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05809,"
In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to know when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies calibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI’s correctness likelihood (CL) but ignored humans’ CL, hindering optimal team decision-making. To mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans’ appropriate trust based on the CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans’ CL by approximating their decision-making models and computing their potential performance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three CL exploitation strategies to calibrate users’ trust explicitly/implicitly in the AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects experiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more appropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We further provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted decision-making.

Scholars who want to research a scientific topic must take time to read, extract meaning, and identify connections across many papers. As scientific literature grows, this becomes increasingly challenging. Meanwhile, authors summarize prior research in papers’ related work sections, though this is scoped to support a single paper. A formative study found that while reading multiple related work paragraphs helps overview a topic, it is hard to navigate overlapping and diverging references and research foci. In this work, we design a system, Relatedly, that scaffolds exploring and reading multiple related work paragraphs on a topic, with features including dynamic re-ranking and highlighting to spotlight unexplored dissimilar information, auto-generated descriptive paragraph headings, and low-lighting of redundant information. From a within-subjects user study (n=15), we found that scholars generate more coherent, insightful, and comprehensive topic outlines using Relatedly compared to a baseline paper list.

 Reflecting on personal challenges can be difficult. Without encouragement, the reflection process often remains superficial, thus inhibiting deeper understanding and learning from past experiences. To allow people to immerse themselves in and deeply reflect on past challenges, we developed SelVReflect, a VR experience which offers active voice-based guidance and a space to freely express oneself. SelVReflect was developed in an iterative design process (N=5) and evaluated in a user study with N=20 participants. We found that SelVReflect enabled participants to approach their challenge and its (emotional) components from different perspectives and to discover new relationships between these components. By making use of the spatial possibilities in VR, participants developed a better understanding of the situation and of themselves. We contribute empirical evidence of how a guided VR experience can support reflection. We discuss opportunities and design requirements for guided VR experiences that aim to foster deeper reflection.

“What It Wants Me To Say”: Bridging the Abstraction Gap Between End-User Programmers and Code-Generating Large Language Models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580817,3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06597,"
 Code-generating large language models map natural language to code. However, only a small portion of the infinite space of naturalistic utterances is effective at guiding code generation. For non-expert end-user programmers, learning this is the challenge of abstraction matching. We examine this challenge in the specific context of data analysis in spreadsheets, in a system that maps the user’s natural language query to Python code using the Codex generator, executes the code, and shows the result. We propose grounded abstraction matching, which bridges the abstraction gap by translating the code back into a systematic and predictable naturalistic utterance. In a between-subjects, think-aloud study (n=24), we compare grounded abstraction matching to an ungrounded alternative based on previously established query framing principles. We find that the grounded approach improves end-users’ understanding of the scope and capabilities of the code-generating model, and the kind of language needed to use it effectively.

Machine learning practitioners often end up tunneling on low-level technical details like model architectures and performance metrics. Could early model development instead focus on high-level questions of which factors a model ought to pay attention to? Inspired by the practice of sketching in design, which distills ideas to their minimal representation, we introduce model sketching: a technical framework for iteratively and rapidly authoring functional approximations of a machine learning model’s decision-making logic. Model sketching refocuses practitioner attention on composing high-level, human-understandable concepts that the model is expected to reason over (e.g., profanity, racism, or sarcasm in a content moderation task) using zero-shot concept instantiation. In an evaluation with 17 ML practitioners, model sketching reframed thinking from implementation to higher-level exploration, prompted iteration on a broader range of model designs, and helped identify gaps in the problem formulation—all in a fraction of the time ordinarily required to build a model.

 External communication of automated vehicles is proposed to replace driver-pedestrian communication in ambiguous crossing situations. So far, research has focused on simpler scenarios with one attentive pedestrian and one automated vehicle. This virtual reality study (N=115) investigates a more complex scenario with other crossing pedestrians, a distracting task on the smartphone, and external communication by the automated vehicle. Interaction effects were found for crossing duration, gaze behavior, and subjective measures. For attentive pedestrians, the external communication resulted in shorter crossing durations, higher perceived safety, as well as lower perceived criticality, cognitive workload, and effort. These positive effects were not found when pedestrians were distracted. Instead, distracted pedestrians benefited from other crossing pedestrians because they looked less at the stopping vehicle, felt safer, perceived the situation as less critical, and reported lower cognitive workload and effort. Pedestrians initiated crossings earlier with a group or external communication and later with a smartphone.

Recent large language models (LLMs) have advanced the quality of open-ended conversations with chatbots. Although LLM-driven chatbots have the potential to support public health interventions by monitoring populations at scale through empathetic interactions, their use in real-world settings is underexplored. We thus examine the case of CareCall, an open-domain chatbot that aims to support socially isolated individuals via check-up phone calls and monitoring by teleoperators. Through focus group observations and interviews with 34 people from three stakeholder groups, including the users, the teleoperators, and the developers, we found CareCall offered a holistic understanding of each individual while offloading the public health workload and helped mitigate loneliness and emotional burdens. However, our findings highlight that traits of LLM-driven chatbots led to challenges in supporting public and personal health needs. We discuss considerations of designing and deploying LLM-driven chatbots for public health intervention, including tensions among stakeholders around system expectations.

We report a large preference for on-body (47.6%) and in-air (40.7%) compared to on-wheelchair (11.7%) gestures, mostly represented by touch input on different parts of the body and hand poses performed in mid-air with one hand. Following an agreement analysis that revealed low consensus (≤ 5.5%) between users, although high perceived gesture ease, goodness, and social acceptability within users, we examine our participants’ gesture characteristics in relation to their self-reported motor impairments, e.g., low strength, rapid fatigue, etc. We highlight the need for personalized gesture sets, tailored to and reflective of both users’ preferences and specific motor abilities, an implication that we examine through the lenses of ability-based design.

Inspired by crowdsourced editing strategies, we curated intuitive text features, such as the number and concreteness of nouns, and trained a proxy model to analyze the feature effects on the AI-generated image. With model explanations of the proxy model, we curated a rubric to adjust text prompts to optimize image generation for precise emotion expression. We conducted simulation and user studies, which showed that RePrompt significantly improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated images, especially for negative emotions.

To accommodate the ambiguous, uncertain, and iterative nature of thematic analysis, the use of user-interpretable patterns allows users to understand and validate what the system has learned, make direct fixes, and easily revise, split, or merge previously annotated codes. This new approach also helps human users to learn data characteristics and form new theories in addition to facilitating the “learning” of the AI model.

 Computer science research has led to many breakthrough innovations but has also been scrutinized for enabling technology that has negative, unintended consequences for society. Given the increasing discussions of ethics in the news and among researchers, we interviewed 20 researchers in various CS sub-disciplines to identify whether and how they consider potential unintended consequences of their research innovations. We show that considering unintended consequences is generally seen as important but rarely practiced. Principal barriers are a lack of formal process and strategy as well as the academic practice that prioritizes fast progress and publications. Drawing on these findings, we discuss approaches to support researchers in routinely considering unintended consequences, from bringing diverse perspectives through community participation to increasing incentives to investigate potential consequences. We intend for our work to pave the way for routine explorations of the societal implications of technological innovations before, during, and after the research process.

 Despite the clear benefits that social connection offers to well-being, strangers in close physical proximity regularly ignore each other due to their tendency to underestimate the positive consequences of social connection. In a between-subjects study (N = 49 pairs, 98 participants), we investigated the effectiveness of a humanoid robot, a computer screen, and a poster at stimulating meaningful, face-to-face conversations between two strangers by posing progressively deeper questions. We found that the humanoid robot facilitator was able to elicit the greatest compliance with the deep conversation questions. Additionally, participants in conversations facilitated by either the humanoid robot or the computer screen reported greater happiness and connection to their conversation partner than those in conversations facilitated by a poster. These results suggest that technology-enabled conversation facilitators can be useful in breaking the ice between strangers, ultimately helping them develop closer connections through face-to-face conversations and thereby enhance their overall well-being.

 Biases in algorithmic systems have led to discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups, including the reinforcement of outdated gender stereotypes. While a substantial body of research addresses biases in algorithms and underlying data, in this work, we study if and how users themselves reflect these biases in their interactions with systems, which expectedly leads to the further manifestation of biases. More specifically, we investigate the replication of stereotypical gender representations by users in formulating online search queries. Following prototype theory, we define the disproportionate mention of the gender that does not conform to the prototypical representative of a searched domain (e.g., “male nurse”) as an indication of bias. In a pilot study with 224 US participants and a main study with 400 UK participants, we find clear evidence of gender biases in formulating search queries. We also report the effects of an educative text on user behaviour and highlight the wish of users to learn about bias-mitigating strategies in their interactions with search engines.

In close exchange with first responder organizations, we developed and evaluated an MR training scenario. In the scenario, users can talk to injured people in a car accident, assess the threat of the environment, and utilize real medical equipment. Participants experienced high levels of physical- and self-presence, increased stress levels, and reported a high technology acceptance.

In this study, we address this question through a survey study with Hispanic users of fitness applications (N= 211) and use the Motivational Technology Model (MTM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as theoretical frameworks. We found that using interactivity features is essential to inspire more autonomous forms of motivation to use fitness applications. This is because interactivity helps satisfy users’ needs for relatedness. However, interactivity also decreased autonomy and competence suggesting the need to design fitness applications that increase relatedness without compromising autonomy. Implications for the design of fitness applications for the population at large and Hispanics, in particular, are discussed.

To design with AI models, user experience (UX) designers must assess the fit between the model and user needs. Based on user research, they need to contextualize the model’s behavior and potential failures within their product-specific data instances and user scenarios. However, our formative interviews with ten UX professionals revealed that such a proactive discovery of model limitations is challenging and time-intensive. Furthermore, designers often lack technical knowledge of AI and accessible exploration tools, which challenges their understanding of model capabilities and limitations. In this work, we introduced a failure-driven design approach to AI, a workflow that encourages designers to explore model behavior and failure patterns early in the design process. The implementation of fAIlureNotes, a designer-centered failure exploration and analysis tool, supports designers in evaluating models and identifying failures across diverse user groups and scenarios.

Social dynamics of AI support in creative writing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580782,2,https://www.katygero.com/papers/2023_SocialDynamics.pdf,"
 Recently, large language models have made huge advances in generating coherent, creative text. While much research focuses on how users can interact with language models, less work considers the social-technical gap that this technology poses. What are the social nuances that underlie receiving support from a generative AI? In this work we ask when and why a creative writer might turn to a computer versus a peer or mentor for support. We interview 20 creative writers about their writing practice and their attitudes towards both human and computer support. We discover three elements that govern a writer’s interaction with support actors: 1) what writers desire help with, 2) how writers perceive potential support actors, and 3) the values writers hold. We align our results with existing frameworks of writing cognition and creativity support, uncovering the social dynamics which modulate user responses to generative technologies.

DataParticles: Block-based and language-oriented authoring of animated unit visualizations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581472,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581472,"
 Unit visualizations have been widely used in data storytelling within interactive articles and videos. However, authoring data stories that contain animated unit visualizations is challenging due to the tedious, time-consuming process of switching back and forth between writing a narrative and configuring the accompanying visualizations and animations. To streamline this process, we present DataParticles, a block-based story editor that leverages the latent connections between text, data, and visualizations to help creators flexibly prototype, explore, and iterate on a story narrative and its corresponding visualizations. To inform the design of DataParticles, we interviewed 6 domain experts and studied a dataset of 44 existing animated unit visualizations to identify the narrative patterns and congruence principles they employed. A user study with 9 experts showed that DataParticles can significantly simplify the process of authoring data stories with animated unit visualizations by encouraging exploration and supporting fast prototyping.

 Open-source software projects have become an integral part of our daily life, supporting virtually every software we use today. Since open-source software forms the digital infrastructure, maintaining them is of utmost importance. We present Climate Coach, a dashboard that helps open-source project maintainers monitor the health of their community in terms of team climate and inclusion. Through a literature review and an exploratory survey (N=18), we identified important signals that can reflect a project’s health, and display them on a dashboard. We evaluated and refined our dashboard through two rounds of think-aloud studies (N=19). We then conducted a two-week longitudinal diary study (N=10) to test the usefulness of our dashboard. We found that displaying signals that are related to a project’s inclusion help improve maintainers’ management strategies.

Rapsai: Accelerating Machine Learning Prototyping of Multimedia Applications through Visual Programming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581338,4,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581338,"
 In recent years, there has been a proliferation of multimedia applications that leverage machine learning (ML) for interactive experiences. Prototyping ML-based applications is, however, still challenging, given complex workflows that are not ideal for design and experimentation. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with seven ML practitioners to gather insights about common ML evaluation workflows.  The study helped us derive six design goals, which informed Rapsai1, a visual programming platform for rapid and iterative development of end-to-end ML-based multimedia applications. Rapsai features a node-graph editor to facilitate interactive characterization and visualization of ML model performance. Rapsai streamlines end-to-end prototyping with interactive data augmentation and model comparison capabilities in its no-coding environment. Our evaluation of Rapsai in four real-world case studies (N=15) suggests that practitioners can accelerate their workflow, make more informed decisions, analyze strengths and weaknesses, and holistically evaluate model behavior with real-world input.

Understanding Moderators' Conflict and Conflict Management Strategies with Streamers in Live Streaming Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580982,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580982,"
 As each micro community centered around the streamer attempts to set its own guidelines in live streaming communities, it is common for volunteer moderators (mods) and the streamer to disagree on how to handle various situations. In this study, we conducted an online survey (N=240) with live streaming mods to explore their commitment to the streamer to grow the micro community and the different styles in which they handle conflicts with the streamer. We found that 1) mods apply more active and cooperative styles than passive and assertive styles to manage conflicts, but they might be forced to do so, and 2) mods with strong commitments to the streamer would like to apply styles showing either high concerns for the streamer or low concerns for themselves. We reflect on how these results can affect micro community development and recommend designs to mitigate conflict and strengthen commitment.

Amortized inference with user simulations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581439,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581439,"
 There have been significant advances in simulation models predicting human behavior across various interactive tasks. One issue remains, however: identifying the parameter values that best describe an individual user. These parameters often express personal cognitive and physiological characteristics, and inferring their exact values has significant effects on individual-level predictions. Still, the high complexity of simulation models usually causes parameter inference to consume prohibitively large amounts of time, as much as days per user. We investigated amortized inference for its potential to reduce inference time dramatically, to mere tens of milliseconds. Its principle is to pre-train a neural proxy model for probabilistic inference, using synthetic data simulated from a range of parameter combinations. From examining the efficiency and prediction performance of amortized inference in three challenging cases that involve real-world data (menu search, point-and-click, and touchscreen typing), the paper demonstrates that an amortized-inference approach permits analyzing large-scale datasets by means of simulation models. It also addresses emerging opportunities and challenges in applying amortized inference in HCI.

 Explaining to novice users how to interact in immersive VR applications may be challenging. This is in particular due to the fact that the learners are isolated from the real world, and they are asked to manipulate hardware and software objects they are not used to. Consequently, the onboarding phase, which consists in teaching the user how to interact with the application is particularly crucial. In this paper, we aim at giving a better understanding of current VR onboarding methods, their benefits and challenges. We performed 21 VR tutorial ergonomic reviews and 15 interviews with VR experts with experience in VR onboarding. Building on the results, we propose a conceptual framework for VR onboarding and discuss important research directions to explore the design of future efficient onboarding solutions adapted to VR.

 Programming instructors often conduct in-class exercises to help them identify students that are falling behind and surface students’ misconceptions. However, as we found in interviews with programming instructors, monitoring students’ progress during exercises is difficult, particularly for large classes. We present VizProg, a system that allows instructors to monitor and inspect students’ coding progress in real-time during in-class exercises. VizProg represents students’ statuses as a 2D Euclidean spatial map that encodes the students’ problem-solving approaches and progress in real-time. VizProg allows instructors to navigate the temporal and structural evolution of students’ code, understand relationships between code, and determine when to provide feedback. A comparison experiment showed that VizProg helped to identify more students’ problems than a baseline system. VizProg also provides richer and more comprehensive information for identifying important student behavior. By managing students’ activities at scale, this work presents a new paradigm for improving the quality of live learning.

FlexBoard offers the rapid prototyping capabilities of traditional breadboards but is also flexible to conform to different shapes and materials. FlexBoard’s bendability is enabled by replacing the rigid body of a breadboard with a flexible living hinge that holds the metal strips from a traditional breadboard while maintaining the standard pin spacing. In addition, FlexBoards are also shape-customizable as they can be cut to a specific length and joined together to form larger prototyping areas. We discuss FlexBoard’s mechanical design and present a technical evaluation of its bendability, adhesion to curved and deformable surfaces, and holding force of electronic components. Finally, we show the usefulness of FlexBoard through 3 application scenarios with interactive textiles, curved tangible user interfaces, and VR.

Comparing Sentence-Level Suggestions to Message-Level Suggestions in AI-Mediated Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581351,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581351,"
Traditionally, writing assistance systems have focused on short or even single-word suggestions. Recently, large language models like GPT-3 have made it possible to generate significantly longer natural-sounding suggestions, offering more advanced assistance opportunities. This study explores the trade-offs between sentence- vs. message-level suggestions for AI-mediated communication. We recruited 120 participants to act as staffers from legislators’ offices who often need to respond to large volumes of constituent concerns. Participants were asked to reply to emails with different types of assistance. The results show that participants receiving message-level suggestions responded faster and were more satisfied with the experience, as they mainly edited the suggested drafts. In addition, the texts they wrote were evaluated as more helpful by others. In comparison, participants receiving sentence-level assistance retained a higher sense of agency, but took longer for the task as they needed to plan the flow of their responses and decide when to use suggestions. Our findings have implications for designing task-appropriate communication assistance systems.

Kerfmeter: Automatic Kerf Calibration for Laser Cutting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580914,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580914,"
We present Kerfmeter, a hardware + software device that automatically determines how much material the laser cutter burns off, also known as kerf. Its knowledge about kerf allows Kerfmeter to make the joints of laser cut 3D models fit together with just the right tension, i.e., loose enough to allow for comfortable assembly, yet tight enough to hold parts together without glue—all this without user interaction. Kerfmeter attaches to the head of a laser cutter and works as follows: when users send a model to the laser cutter, Kerfmeter intercepts the job, injects a brief calibration routine that determines kerf, dilates the cutting plan according to this kerf, and then proceeds to fabricate the cutting plan. During the calibration routine, Kerfmeter cuts a 2cm Archimedean spiral and uses a motor to rotate it in place until it jams against the surrounding material; the angle at which the spiral jams allows Kerfmeter to infer kerf. The calibration process takes about 20s, which is >10x faster than traditional, manual kerf calibration, while also eliminating the need for expertise. In our technical evaluation, Kerfmeter produced functioning press fit joints reliably at a precision comparable to traditional manual kerf strips. Kerfmeter makes it easy to sample repeatedly; we demonstrate how this allows boosting precision past any traditional kerf strip.

 Siblings play a crucial and long-lasting role in family connections and relationships. However, with the older sibling transitioning out of their parental home, maintaining a close sibling relationship can be challenging, especially if siblings have a large age difference. We conducted a diary and interview study with nine families in China which have spaced siblings, to identify design opportunities for technology to better support their communication and connection needs. We contribute to the HCI community in three aspects. First, we contribute an empirical understanding of current communication patterns from distributed families with large age gap siblings in China. Second, we identify current facilitation roles, practices, and challenges regarding sibling relationships from different stakeholders’ perspectives. Last but not least, we present technological opportunities for supporting the large-gap sibling relationship, informing directions for future research and design for distributed families.

We develop RiCE through i) an expert review of questionnaire items (n=10) and ii) an exploratory factor analysis (n=300) of the reviewed items. We also present a user study testing RiCE (n=58) across two time points (one week apart) with novel interfaces designed for creative writing and music making. Although we do not confirm validity, we identify four factors for RiCE which we suggest are interpretable in a conceptually meaningful way. Our formative studies contribute towards supporting future explorations on reflection with CSTs.

Gaze-Hand Alignment has recently been proposed for multimodal selection in 3D. The technique takes advantage of gaze for target pre-selection, as it naturally precedes manual input. Selection is then completed when manual input aligns with gaze on the target, without need for an additional click method. In this work we evaluate two alignment techniques, Gaze&Finger and Gaze&Handray, combining gaze with image plane pointing versus raycasting, in comparison with hands-only baselines and Gaze&Pinch as established multimodal technique. We used Fitts’ Law study design with targets presented at different depths in the visual scene, to assess effect of parallax on performance. The alignment techniques outperformed their respective hands-only baselines. Gaze&Finger is efficient when targets are close to the image plane but less performant with increasing target depth due to parallax.

The platform, Nosh, provides an alternative to mainstream services, such as Doordash and Uber Eats, in several communities in the Western United States. We interviewed 28 stakeholders including restauranteurs, couriers, consumers, and platform administrators. Drawing on infrastructure literature, we learned that the platform is a patchwork of disparate technical systems held together by human intervention. Participants join this platform because they receive greater agency, financial security, and local support. We identify human intervention’s key role in making food delivery platform users feel respected. This study provides insights into the affordances, limitations, and possibilities of food delivery platforms designed to prioritize local contexts over transnational scales.

In order to help scholars understand and follow a research topic, significant research has been devoted to creating systems that help scholars discover relevant papers and authors. Recent approaches have shown the usefulness of highlighting relevant authors while scholars engage in paper discovery. However, these systems do not capture and utilize users’ evolving knowledge of authors. We reflect on the design space and introduce ComLittee, a literature discovery system that supports author-centric exploration. In contrast to paper-centric interaction in prior systems, ComLittee’s author-centric interaction supports curating research threads from individual authors, finding new authors and papers using combined signals from a paper recommender and the curated authors’ authorship graphs, and understanding them in the context of those signals. In a within-subjects experiment that compares to a paper-centric discovery system with author-highlighting, we demonstrate how ComLittee improves author and paper discovery.

 Recent years have seen growing interest among both researchers and practitioners in user-engaged approaches to algorithm auditing, which directly engage users in detecting problematic behaviors in algorithmic systems. However, we know little about industry practitioners’ current practices and challenges around user-engaged auditing, nor what opportunities exist for them to better leverage such approaches in practice. To investigate, we conducted a series of interviews and iterative co-design activities with practitioners who employ user-engaged auditing approaches in their work. Our findings reveal several challenges practitioners face in appropriately recruiting and incentivizing user auditors, scaffolding user audits, and deriving actionable insights from user-engaged audit reports. Furthermore, practitioners shared organizational obstacles to user-engaged auditing, surfacing a complex relationship between practitioners and user auditors. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for future HCI research to help realize the potential (and mitigate risks) of user-engaged auditing in industry practice.

We conducted a mixed-factorial-design experiment with 26 younger and 25 older adults, assigned to three SRL strategies (within-subjects): monologue, dialogue-based scaffolding building, and conceptual diagramming. We found that while younger adults benefit more from scaffolding building and conceptual diagramming, both younger and older adults showed equivalent learning outcomes. Furthermore, interaction fluency (operationalized by the number of conversational breakdowns) was associated with learning outcomes regardless of age. While older adults did not experience less fluent conversations, interaction fluency affected their technology acceptance toward VUIs more than younger ones. Our study discusses age-related learning differences and has implications for designing VUI-based learning programs for older adults.

Embodiment toward an avatar in virtual reality (VR) is generally stronger when there is a high degree of alignment between the user’s and self-avatar’s motion. However, one-to-one mapping between the two is not always ideal when user interacts with the virtual environment. On these occasions, the user input often leads to unnatural behavior without physical realism (e.g., objects penetrating virtual body, body unmoved by hitting stimuli). We investigate how adding physics correction to self-avatar motion impacts embodiment. Physics-aware self-avatar preserves the physical meaning of the movement but introduces discrepancies between the user’s and self-avatar’s motion, whose contingency is a determining factor for embodiment. To understand its impact, we conducted an in-lab study (n = 20) where participants interacted with obstacles on their upper bodies in VR with and without physics correction. Our results showed that, rather than compromising embodiment level, physics-responsive self-avatar improved embodiment compared to no-physics condition in both active and passive interactions.

We propose a conceptual perspective on prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) that distinguishes between (1) diegetic prompts (part of the narrative, e.g. “Once upon a time, I saw a fox...”), and (2) non-diegetic prompts (external, e.g. “Write about the adventures of the fox.”). With this lens, we study how 129 crowd workers on Prolific write short texts with different user interfaces (1 vs 3 suggestions, with/out non-diegetic prompts; implemented with GPT-3): When the interface offered multiple suggestions and provided an option for non-diegetic prompting, participants preferred choosing from multiple suggestions over controlling them via non-diegetic prompts. When participants provided non-diegetic prompts it was to ask for inspiration, topics or facts. Single suggestions in particular were guided both with diegetic and non-diegetic information. This work informs human-AI interaction with generative models by revealing that (1) writing non-diegetic prompts requires effort, (2) people combine diegetic and non-diegetic prompting, and (3) they use their draft (i.e. diegetic information) and suggestion timing to strategically guide LLMs.

Silent speech interface is a promising technology that enables private communications in natural language. However, previous approaches only support a small and inflexible vocabulary, which leads to limited expressiveness. We leverage contrastive learning to learn efficient lipreading representations, enabling few-shot command customization with minimal user effort. Our model exhibits high robustness to different lighting, posture, and gesture conditions on an in-the-wild dataset. For 25-command classification, an F1-score of 0.8947 is achievable only using one shot, and its performance can be further boosted by adaptively learning from more data. This generalizability allowed us to develop a mobile silent speech interface empowered with on-device fine-tuning and visual keyword spotting. A user study demonstrated that with LipLearner, users could define their own commands with high reliability guaranteed by an online incremental learning scheme. Subjective feedback indicated that our system provides essential functionalities for customizable silent speech interactions with high usability and learnability.

 User interfaces typically feature tools to act on objects and rely on the ability of users to discover or learn how to interact with them. Previous work in HCI has used the Theory of Affordances to explain how users understand the possibilities for action in digital environments. A complementary theory from cognitive neuroscience, Technical Reasoning, posits that users accumulate abstract knowledge of object properties and technical principles known as mechanical knowledge, essential in tool use. Drawing from this theory, we introduce interaction knowledge as the “mechanical” knowledge of digital environments. We provide evidence of its relevance by reporting on an experiment where participants performed tasks in a digital environment with ambiguous possibilities for interaction. We analyze how interaction knowledge was transferred across two digital domains, text editing and graphical editing, and conclude that interaction knowledge models an essential type of knowledge for interacting in the digital world.

 The Hexad scale is a crucial tool for personalized gamification in user experience (UX) design. However, completing a 24-item questionnaire can increase dropout rates and screen fatigue within online surveys. When included in larger surveys, scale brevity makes a difference. To reduce the time required for the assessment process, we developed and validated a 12-item version of the Hexad scale. To create it, we carried out an exploratory factor analysis on an existing data set to identify appropriate items (n = 882). To validate the 12-item version, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis on a new data set (n = 1, 101). Our results show that Hexad-12 outperforms the original Hexad scale regarding model fit, reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity. Therefore, Hexad-12 resolves issues found in studies using the original Hexad scale and provides a suitable and swift instrument for concisely assessing Hexad user types in tailored gamification design.

In design sessions with nine residents and three caregivers, we uncovered a number of insights about sPD that help us understand its benefits and limitations. For example, we observed how designs evolved through iterative interactions and how early exposure to the robot helped participants consider using the robot in their daily life. With sPD, we aim to help future researchers to increase and deepen the participation of older adults in designing assistive technologies.

DeepLens: Interactive Out-of-distribution Data Detection in NLP Models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580741,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01577,"
Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. A fundamental assumption in ML is that training data and real-world data should follow a similar distribution. However, a deployed ML model may suffer from out-of-distribution (OOD) issues due to distribution shifts in the real-world data. Though many algorithms have been proposed to detect OOD data from text corpora, there is still a lack of interactive tool support for ML developers. In this work, we propose DeepLens, an interactive system that helps users detect and explore OOD issues in massive text corpora. Users can efficiently explore different OOD types in DeepLens with the help of a text clustering method. Users can also dig into a specific text by inspecting salient words highlighted through neuron activation analysis. In a within-subjects user study with 24 participants, participants using DeepLens were able to find nearly twice more types of OOD issues accurately with 22% more confidence compared with a variant of DeepLens that has no interaction or visualization support.

Drifting Off in Paradise: Why People Sleep in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580947,1,,"
 Sleep is important for humans, and past research has considered methods of improving sleep through technologies such as virtual reality (VR). However, there has been limited research on how such VR technology may affect the experiential and practical aspects of sleep, especially outside of a clinical lab setting. We consider this research gap through the lens of individuals that voluntarily engage in the practice of sleeping in VR. Semi-structured interviews with 14 participants that have slept in VR reveal insights regarding the motivations, actions, and experiential factors that uniquely define this practice. We find that participant motives can be largely categorized through either the experiential or social affordances of VR. We tie these motives into findings regarding the unique customs of sleeping in VR, involving set-up both within the physical and virtual space. Finally, we identify current and future challenges for sleeping in VR, and propose prospective design directions.

 Software engineers exhibit higher burnout and suicide rates compared to many other information workers. Consequently, mental wellbeing is a growing concern to technology organizations. To better understand the challenges of supporting mental wellbeing in the context of the work of software engineering, we conducted 14 interviews with software engineers. We examine the different aspects of their lived experiences with mental wellbeing at work, their strategies for managing mental wellbeing, the challenges they face in using these strategies, and recommendations they have for mental wellbeing technologies. We contribute to the HCI literature by discussing how mental wellbeing should be considered within the context of work across individual, team, and organization levels, and highlight the need for integrating mental wellbeing into the technologies employees use at work.

Personalised But Impersonal: Listeners' Experiences of Algorithmic Curation on Music Streaming Services,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581492,1,,"
The consumption of music is increasingly reliant on the personalisation, recommendation, and automated curation features of music streaming services. Using algorithm experience (AX) as a lens, we investigated the user experience of the algorithmic recommendation and automated curation features of several popular music streaming services. We conducted interviews and participant-observation with 15 daily users of music streaming services, followed by a design workshop. We found that despite the utility of increasingly algorithmic personalisation, listeners experienced these algorithmic and recommendation features as impersonal in determining their background listening, music discovery, and playlist curation. While listener desire for more control over recommendation settings is not new, we offer a number of novel insights about music listening to nuance this understanding, particularly through the notion of vibe.

Social Media as a Critical Pedagogical Tool: Examining the Relationship between Youths' Online Sociopolitical Engagements and Their Critical Consciousness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580823,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580823,"
 Social injustices are commonly discussed on social media, presenting opportunities for youth to engage with this content and develop into engaged citizens. While much has been written about youths’ online activism, less is known about how engaging with sociopolitical content may build their capacity for activist work. We explore the extent to which youths’ engagement with sociopolitical content on various social media platforms is associated with critical consciousness—an awareness of inequities, the motivation to address them, and action that combats injustice. To investigate this relationship, we conducted a survey with 339 high school-aged youths. While sociopolitical engagement on some platforms was positively associated with youths’ critical consciousness measures, sociopolitical engagement on other platforms was negatively associated. Qualitative post-hoc analysis was used to suggest reasons for possible differences. In light of our findings, we discuss the relationship between online sociopolitical engagement and critical consciousness and suggest directions for future work.

Investigating How Practitioners Use Human-AI Guidelines: A Case Study on the People+ AI Guidebook,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580900,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580900,"
 Artificial intelligence (AI) presents new challenges for the user experience (UX) of products and services. Recently, practitioner-facing resources and design guidelines have become available to ease some of these challenges. However, little research has investigated if and how these guidelines are used, and how they impact practice. In this paper, we investigated how industry practitioners use the People + AI Guidebook. We conducted interviews with 31 practitioners (i.e., designers, product managers) to understand how they use human-AI guidelines when designing AI-enabled products. Our findings revealed that practitioners use the guidebook not only for addressing AI’s design challenges, but also for education, cross-functional communication, and for developing internal resources. We uncovered that practitioners desire more support for early phase ideation and problem formulation to avoid AI product failures. We discuss the implications for future resources aiming to help practitioners in designing AI products.

Diversity in datasets is a key component to building responsible AI/ML. Despite this recognition, we know little about the diversity among the annotators involved in data production. We investigated the approaches to annotator diversity through 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 44 AI/ML practitioners. While practitioners described nuanced understandings of annotator diversity, they rarely designed dataset production to account for diversity in the annotation process. The lack of action was explained through operational barriers: from the lack of visibility in the annotator hiring process, to the conceptual difficulty in incorporating worker diversity. We argue that such operational barriers and the widespread resistance to accommodating annotator diversity surface a prevailing logic in data practices—where neutrality, objectivity and ‘representationalist thinking’ dominate. By understanding this logic to be part of a regime of existence, we explore alternative ways of accounting for annotator subjectivity and diversity in data practices.

Full-hand Electro-Tactile Feedback without Obstructing Palmar Side of Hand,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581382,1,,"
We present a technique to render tactile feedback to the palmar side of the hand while keeping it unobstructed and, thus, preserving manual dexterity during interactions with physical objects. We implement this by applying electro-tactile stimulation only to the back of the hand and to the wrist. In our approach, there are no electrodes on the palmar side, yet that is where tactile sensations are felt. While we place electrodes outside the user's palm, we do so in strategic locations that conduct the electrical currents to the median/ulnar nerves, causing tactile sensations on the palmar side of the hand. In our user studies, we demonstrated that our approach renders tactile sensations to 11 different locations on the palmar side while keeping users’ palms free for dexterous manipulations. Our approach enables new applications such as tactile notifications during dexterous activities or VR experiences that rely heavily on physical props.

 Social media platforms are a place where people look for information and social support for mental health, resulting in both positive and negative effects on users. TikTok has gained notoriety for an abundance of mental health content and discourse. We present findings from a semi-structured interview study with 16 participants about mental health content and participants’ perceptions of community on TikTok. We find that TikTok’s community structure is permeable, allowing for self-discovery and understanding not found in traditional online communities. However, participants are wary of mental health information due to conflicts between a creator’s vulnerability and credibility. Our interviews suggest that the “For You Page"" is a runaway train that encourages diverse community and content engagement but also displays harmful content that participants feel they cannot escape. We propose design implications to support better mental health, as well as implications for social computing research on community in algorithmic landscapes.

Using workers’ own data as well as city-level data, we create probes—interactive data visuals—that participants explore to surface the well-being and positionalities that shape their work strategies. We describe participant insights and corresponding AI design considerations surfaced from data probes about: 1) workers’ well-being trade-offs and positionality constraints, 2) factors that impact well-being beyond those in the data probes, and 3) instances of unfair algorithmic management.

 Social media platform success relies on users to consume, create, and share creative content.

Through an interview study of 15 creatives on TikTok, we explore the often overlapping intentions for creating and sharing videos, as well as the challenges to maintaining these creative intentions and routines as they are shaped by platform logic. We find platforms introduce impediments which disrupt people’s creative routines and alienate people from their overlapping creative intentions; introducing challenges which alienate people from their sense of self, and their audiences. We construct a broader definition of creative labor - the work of professionalizing and monetizing a creative product shared on social media - reflecting on how the routine enactment of creative labor is impacted by infrastructural elements of technology.

 Desired model behavior often differs across contexts (e.g., different geographies, communities, or institutions), but there is little infrastructure to facilitate context-specific evaluations key to deployment decisions and building trust. Here, we present Kaleidoscope, a system for evaluating models in terms of user-driven, domain-relevant concepts. Kaleidoscope’s iterative workflow enables generalizing from a few examples into a larger, diverse set representing an important concept. These example sets can be used to test model outputs or shifts in model behavior in semantically-meaningful ways. For instance, we might construct a “xenophobic comments” set and test that its examples are more likely to be flagged by a content moderation model than a “civil discussion” set. To evaluate Kaleidoscope, we compare it against template- and DSL-based grouping methods, and conduct a usability study with 13 Reddit users testing a content moderation model. We find that Kaleidoscope facilitates iterative, exploratory hypothesis testing across diverse, conceptually-meaningful example sets.

 CHI papers researching healthcare human-computer interaction (HCI) are increasingly reporting the use of “thematic analysis” (TA). TA refers to a range of flexible and evolving approaches for qualitative data analysis. Its increased use demonstrates a change in research practices, and with that the emergence of new local standards. We need to understand and reflect upon these emerging local practices, including departures from what is advocated as quality TA practice more generally. Toward this, we conducted a scoping review of a decade of CHI publications (2012 – 2021) that researched healthcare and termed their analysis approach “thematic analysis”; 78 papers reporting a total of 100 TAs were included. We contribute a description of 1) the contexts in which TA is being used, 2) the TA approaches being conducted, and 3) how TA is being reported. Drawing on this, we discuss opportunities to improve research practice when using TA in healthcare HCI.

 Given decades of Human computer interaction (HCI) research focused on scientific empiricism, it can be hard for the field to acknowledge that data analysis is both an emotional and speculative process. But what does it mean for this process of data analysis to embrace its situated and speculative nature? In this paper, we explore this possibility by building on decades of HCI mixed methods that root data analysis in design. Drawing on an autoethnographic design inquiry, we examine how data analysis can work as an implicating process, one that is not only critically grounded in a designer’s own situation but also offers modes of imagining the world otherwise. In this analysis, we find that autobiographical design can help HCI scholars to respond to current critiques of speculative design by grounding and rendering more personal certain kinds of speculation, opening a space for diverse voices to emerge.

 Creative coding is a rapidly expanding domain for both artistic expression and computational education. Numerous libraries and IDEs support creative coding, however there has been little consideration of how the environments themselves might be designed to serve these twin goals. To investigate this gap, we implemented and used an experimental editor to teach a sequence of college and high-school creative coding courses. In the first year, we conducted a log analysis of student work (n=39) and surveys regarding prospective features (n=25). These guided our implementation of common enhancements (e.g. color pickers) as well as uncommon ones (e.g. bidirectional shape editing). In the second year, we studied the effects of these features through logging (n=39+) and survey (n=23) studies. Reflecting on the results, we identify opportunities to improve creativity- and novice-focused IDEs and highlight tensions in their design—as in tools that augment artistry or efficiency but may be perceived as hindering learning.

 What is the impact of human-computer interaction research on industry? While it is impossible to track all research impact pathways, the growing literature on translational research impact measurement offers patent citations as one measure of how industry recognizes and draws on research in its inventions. In this paper, we perform a large-scale measurement study primarily of 70, 000 patent citations to premier HCI research venues, tracing how HCI research are cited in United States patents over the last 30 years. We observe that 20.1% of papers from these venues, including 60–80% of papers at UIST and 13% of papers in a broader dataset of SIGCHI-sponsored venues overall, are cited by patents—far greater than premier venues in science overall (9.7%) and NLP (11%). However, the time lag between a patent and its paper citations is long (10.5 years) and getting longer, suggesting that HCI research and practice may not be efficiently connected.

3D Building Plans: Supporting Navigation by People who are Blind or have Low Vision in Multi-Storey Buildings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581389,1,,"
Independent travel and navigation in new environments, in particular multi-storey buildings, is a major challenge for people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). Using tactile maps as part of orientation and mobility (O&M) training, BLV people can build a cognitive map of an environment before visiting. Tactile maps of multi-level environments, however, have received little attention. We investigated the usefulness of 3D printed models of buildings, through a user study with nine BLV adults. Three designs were evaluated: flat, overlapped-sliding and overlapped-rotating. All three designs were reported to be useful, usable, engaging and allowed participants to build a cognitive map of the building. There was a strong user preference for the overlapped presentations, which were reported to be more effective in supporting cross-floor spatial knowledge. This exploration of the design space of 3D building plans demonstrates their value and we hope will encourage their provision in O&M training.

Low-fidelity prototyping is so foundational to Human-Computer Interaction, appearing in most early design phases. So, how do experts prototype olfactory experiences? We interviewed eight experts and found that they do not because no process supports this. Thus, we engineered Smell & Paste, a low-fidelity prototyping toolkit. Designers assemble olfactory proofs-of-concept by pasting scratch-and-sniff stickers onto a paper tape. Then, they test the interaction by advancing the tape in our 3D-printed (or cardboard) cassette, which releases the smells via scratching. Our toolkit uses commodity materials; keeps iterations quick, approachable, and cheap; and circumvents electronics, programming, and chemical handling. We evaluated Smell & Paste in two studies. We found that the toolkit was approachable to people of any technical background and that novices and experts appropriated and extended the toolkit, making it personalized. Novices produced prototypes quickly, and experts were excited about the kit's technical affordances and integrating it into their practice.

 Mitigating algorithmic bias is a critical task in the development and deployment of machine learning models.

Two common approaches of evaluating the fairness of a model are group fairness and individual fairness. We run a study with Machine Learning practitioners (n=24) to understand the strategies used to evaluate models. Metrics presented to practitioners (group vs. individual fairness) impact which models they consider fair. Participants focused on risks associated with underpredicting / overpredicting and model sensitivity relative to identity token manipulations. We discover fairness assessment strategies involving personal experiences or how users form groups of identity tokens to test model fairness. We provide recommendations for interactive tools for evaluating fairness in text classification.

Both enterprises and their employees have globally experienced remote work at an unprecedented scale since the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic becomes less of a threat, some companies have called their employees back to a physical office, citing issues related to working remotely, but many employees have refused to return. Thus, working in the metaverse has gained much attention as an alternative that could complement the weaknesses of completely remote work or even offline work. However, we do not know yet what benefits and drawbacks the metaverse has as a legitimate workspace, because there are few real cases of 1) working in the metaverse and 2) working remotely at such an unprecedented scale. Thus, this paper aims to identify real challenges and opportunities the metaverse workspace presents when compared to remote work by conducting semi-structured interviews and participatory workshops with various employees and company stakeholders (e.g., HR managers and CEOs) who have experienced at least two of three work types: working in a physical office, remotely, or in the metaverse. Consequently, we identified 1) advantages and disadvantages of remote work and 2) opportunities and challenges of the metaverse. We further discuss design implications that may overcome the identified challenges of working in the metaverse.

 Computational toys and apps, or coding kits, are the primary learning media for young children to engage in Computational Thinking concepts and skills. However, how coding kits are designed to welcome children of different genders remains unclear, a critical research gap given that computing is mostly a male-dominated field. Drawing on relevant literature, we develop a framework of gender-related design features in toys (i.e., boy-oriented, girl-oriented, or gender-neutral features) and employ it to examine gender-related design features in commercially available coding kits for young children aged seven and under (N=110). The findings reveal the lopsided gender representation in coding kits, e.g., their physical forms and supported coding activities are predominantly boy-oriented. We discuss design and research implications for coding kits to welcome participation from children of different genders, especially young girls whose preferred design features are underrepresented in current designs.

 Woven textiles are increasingly a medium through which HCI is inventing new technologies. Key challenges in integrating woven textiles in HCI include the high level of textile knowledge required to make effective use of the new possibilities they afford and the need for tools that bridge the concerns of textile designers and concerns of HCI researchers. This paper presents AdaCAD, a parametric design tool for designing woven textile structures. Through our design and evaluation of AdaCAD we found that parametric design helps weavers notate and explain the logics behind the complex structures they generate. We discuss these finding in relation to prior work in integrating craft and/or weaving in HCI, histories of woven notation, and boundary object theory to illuminate further possibilities for collaboration between craftspeople and HCI practitioners.

Key Considerations for The Design of Technology for Enrichment in Residential Aged Care: An Ethnographic Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581176,1,,"
Technology can be valuable for providing social and emotional enrichment for people living in residential aged care, but its use is difficult to sustain because of the complexity of the aged care environment. This paper aims to advance understanding of care environments to inform the sensitive design of technologies for social benefit in those settings. We conducted an ethnographic study in which the researcher assisted a care home's leisure and lifestyle team over four weeks. This included supporting the use of video-calling for social connectedness. A decrease in the use of video-calling and an absence of other technology for enrichment in the setting were observed. This paper identifies barriers to effective use of technology for enrichment and the interplay of cultural factors. For technology to best support residents and staff, we recommend key design considerations that target cultural, psychological and physical support and that ensure technologies, when used appropriately, better fit within the environment.

 Creating highly realistic Virtual Reality (VR) bicycle experiences can be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, it is unclear what hardware parts are necessary to design a bicycle simulator and whether a bicycle is needed at all. In this paper, we investigated cycling fidelity and control of VR bicycle simulators. For this, we developed and evaluated three cycling simulators: (1) cycling without a bicycle (bikeless), (2) cycling on a fixed (stationary) and (3) moving bicycle (tandem) with four levels of control (no control, steering, pedaling, and steering + pedaling). To evaluate all combinations of fidelity and control, we conducted a controlled experiment (N = 24) in indoor and outdoor settings. We found that the bikeless setup provides the highest feeling of safety, while the tandem leads to the highest realism without increasing motion sickness. Moreover, we discovered that bicycles are not essential for cycling in VR.

We engaged in a co-design process with a Duncanian dancer consisting of conversations and participation in her transmission of Duncan’s choreographies and technique. We then articulated experiential qualities central to Duncan’s repertoire and used them to guide the design of the probes, the sounding scarfs. Our probes sonify dancers’ movements using temporal sensors embedded in the fabric of the scarfs, with the goal of evoking Duncan’s work and legacy. We shared the probes with our Duncan dance community and found that they deepen the dancers’ engagement with the repertoire.

Designing for Peer-Led Critical Pedagogies in Computer-Mediated Support Groups for Home Care Workers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580881,1,http://www.nixdell.com/papers/2023-chi-peers.pdf,"
 Home care workers (HCWs) deliver essential health services within patients’ homes and are an important part of the US healthcare system. Yet, they are a marginalized workforce, whose physical isolation and lack of access to support structures make them vulnerable to exploitation. Computer-mediated support programs may help bridge this gap and, through critical and liberatory pedagogies, foster material social change. However, such pedagogies typically assume the involvement of a professional facilitator when, in practice, support programs are often led by peers with little to no facilitation training. Based on a three-month study with HCWs, this paper explores how peers can perform critical and liberatory facilitation practice in an online support program. We illustrate the challenges peers faced learning this practice and performing this role in an online environment. Our findings can improve the design of computer-mediated support programs and how to prepare peer leadership, particularly for addressing the needs of marginalized populations.

""" My Zelda Cane"": Strategies Used by Blind Players to Play Visual-Centric Digital Games",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580702,2,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580702,"
 Mainstream games are typically designed around the visual experience, with behaviors and interactions highly dependent on vision. Despite this, blind people are playing mainstream games while dealing with and overcoming inaccessible content, often together with friends and audiences. In this work, we analyze over 70 hours of YouTube videos, where blind content-creators play visual-centric games. We point out the various strategies employed by players to overcome barriers that permeate mainstream games. We reflect on ways to enable and improve blind players’ experience with these games, shedding light on the positive and negative consequences of apparently benign design choices. Our observations underline how game elements are appropriated for accessibility, the incidental consequences of audio design, and the trade-offs between accessibility, agency, and engagement.

Bones of contention: Social acceptance of digital cemetery technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581520,1,,"
Digital technologies play an increasingly prominent role in memorialisation, but their use at cemeteries has been criticised for lack of sensitivity. Designers of digital cemetery technologies (cemtech) face a high risk of causing offence or failing to attract users due to social norms of memorial sites. To map this area of design and its pitfalls, we first developed a typology of cemtech through a review of examples from around the world. We then evaluated social acceptance of various types of cemtech through a survey of 1,053 Australian residents. Younger people were more accepting of cemtech than older people. Acceptance was highest for cemtech with three characteristics: familiarity, intimacy of user group and peacefulness. Through a reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four attitudinal dichotomies that explain divergent reactions to cemtech: Expands/Impedes, Public/Private, Lively/Restful and Pragmatic/Affective. We conclude with a discussion of how this work can assist designers of public memorialisation technologies.

JumpMod: Haptic Backpack that Modifies Users' Perceived Jump,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580764,1,https://lab.plopes.org/published/2023-CHI-JumpMod.pdf,"
Vertical force-feedback is extremely rare in mainstream interactive experiences. This happens because existing haptic devices capable of sufficiently strong forces that would modify a user's jump require grounding (e.g., motion platforms or pulleys) or cumbersome actuators (e.g., large propellers attached or held by the user). To enable interactive experiences to feature jump-based haptics without sacrificing wearability, we propose JumpMod, an untethered backpack that modifies one's sense of jumping. JumpMod achieves this by moving a weight up/down along the user's back, which modifies perceived jump momentum—creating accelerated & decelerated jump sensations. In our second study, we empirically found that our device can render five effects: jump higher, land harder/softer, pulled higher/lower. Based on these, we designed four jumping experiences for VR & sports. Finally, in our third study, we found that participants preferred wearing our device in an interactive context, such as one of our jump-based VR applications.

 Using biosignals through electromyography (EMG) and rendering them as feedback for hands-free interaction finally migrates to engaging virtual reality (VR) experiences for health and fitness-related applications. Previous work proposes various body locations as input sources and different output modalities for creating effective biofeedback loops. However, it is currently unknown which muscles and sensory modalities can provide optimal real-time interaction regarding the performance and perceived workload of the users. In two VR studies (N=18 and N=40) based on a Fitts’ law target selection task, we explored sensor placement at different body locations and investigate auditory, tactile, and visual feedback modalities. Objective and subjective results indicate that input performance can be improved by presenting muscle tension as simultaneous tactile and visual feedback. We contribute with recommendations for registration of isometric muscle contraction at different body locations and conclude that reproducing physiological feedback through multimodal channels can assist users interacting with EMG devices.

Creating inclusive voices for the 21st century: A non-binary text-to-speech for conversational assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581281,1,,"
 As voice assistant usage continues to grow, their homogeneity becomes even more problematic with the UNESCO report, “I’d Blush if I could” showing that designing only feminine voice assistants encourages negative behavior, both with virtual assistants and with real people [3]. While masculine text-to-speech (TTS) voices exist, ones that cover the full range of gender presentations, such as non-binary or gender-ambiguous voices are largely missing. In this paper, we present a method of creating a non-binary TTS voice and an example voice, Sam, created with input from the non-binary and transgender communities. We have open-sourced the resulting voice, along with the process and data used to create it. Finally, we present results from a large-scale survey showing that non-binary individuals are more likely to prefer a non-binary voice assistant compared to cisgendered individuals and discuss differences across age and gender.

 Half a century since the concept of a cyborg was introduced, digital cyborgs, enabled by the spread of wearable robotics, are the focus of much research in recent times. We introduce JIZAI ARMS, a supernumerary robotic limb system consisting of a wearable base unit with six terminals and detachable robot arms controllable by the wearer. The system was designed to enable social interaction between multiple wearers, such as an exchange of arm(s), and explore possible interactions between digital cyborgs in a cyborg society. This paper describes the JIZAI ARMS’ design process, an interdisciplinary collaboration between human augmentation researchers, product designers, a system architect, and manufacturers, to realize a technically complex system while considering the aesthetics of a digital cyborg. We also provide an autobiographical report of our first impressions of using the JIZAI ARMS and use our findings to speculate on a model of potential social interactions between digital cyborgs.

 We theoretically develop the ethical positions implicit in somaesthetic interaction design and, using the case study of a water faucet, illustrate our conceptual understanding of ethical sensibilities in design. We apply four lenses – the felt self, intercorporeal self, socio-cultural and political self, and entangled self – to show how our selves and ethical sensibilities are fundamentally constituted by a socially, materially, and technologically entwined world. Further, we show how ethical sensibilities are cultivated in the practice of somaesthetic interaction design. We contribute felt ethics as an approach to cultivating ethical sensibilities in design practice. The felt ethics approach is comprised of (i) a processual cultivation of ethical sensibility through analytical, pragmatic, and practical engagement, (ii) an ongoing critical attentiveness to the limits of our own bodies and lived experiences, and (iii) the rendering visible of our ethical practices as a matter of care.

 The seamless integration of technology into the lives of youth has raised concerns about their digital safety. While prior work has explored youth experiences with physical, sexual, and emotional threats—such as bullying and trafficking—a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the myriad threats that youth experience is needed. By synthesizing the perspectives of 36 youth and 65 adult participants from the U.S., we provide an overview of today’s complex digital-safety landscape. We describe attacks youth experienced, how these moved across platforms and into the physical world, and the resulting harms. We also describe protective practices the youth and the adults who support them took to prevent, mitigate, and recover from attacks, and key barriers to doing this effectively. Our findings provide a broad perspective to help improve digital safety for youth and set directions for future work.

The Effects of Avatar and Environment on Thermal Perception and Skin Temperature in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580668,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580668,"
 Humans’ thermal regulation and subjective perception of temperature is highly plastic and depends on the visual appearance of the surrounding environment. Previous work shows that an environment’s color temperature affects the experienced temperature. As virtual reality (VR) enables visual immersion, recent work suggests that a VR scene’s color temperature also affects experienced temperature. It is, however, unclear if an avatar’s appearance also affects users’ thermal perception and if a change in thermal perception even influences the body temperature. Therefore, we conducted a study with 32 participants performing a task in an ice or fire world while having ice or fire hands. We show that being in a fire world or having fire hands increases the perceived temperature. We even show that having fire hands decreases the hand temperature compared to having ice hands. We discuss the implications for the design of VR systems and future research directions.

Co-Designing with Early Adolescents: Understanding Perceptions of and Design Considerations for Tech-Based Mediation Strategies that Promote Technology …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581134,1,,"
Children's excessive use of technology is a growing concern, and despite taking various measures, parents often find it difficult to limit their children's device use. Limiting tech usage can be especially challenging with early adolescents as they start to develop a sense of autonomy. While numerous tech-based mediation solutions exist, in this paper, we aim to learn from early adolescents directly by having them contribute to co-design activities. Through a multi-session, group-based, online co-design study with 21 early adolescents (ages 11-14), we explore their perceptions towards tech overuse and what types of solutions they propose to help with disengagement. Findings from these co-design sessions contribute insights into how the participants conceptualized the problem of tech overuse, how they envisioned appropriate mediation strategies, and important design considerations. We also reflect on our study methods, which encouraged active participation from our participants and facilitated valuable contributions during the online co-design sessions.

 Recent research claims that information cues and system attributes of algorithmic decision-making processes affect decision subjects’ fairness perceptions. However, little is still known about how these factors interact. This paper presents a user study (N = 267) investigating the individual and combined effects of explanations, human oversight, and contestability on informational and procedural fairness perceptions for high- and low-stakes decisions in a loan approval scenario. We find that explanations and contestability contribute to informational and procedural fairness perceptions, respectively, but we find no evidence for an effect of human oversight. Our results further show that both informational and procedural fairness perceptions contribute positively to overall fairness perceptions but we do not find an interaction effect between them. A qualitative analysis exposes tensions between information overload and understanding, human involvement and timely decision-making, and accounting for personal circumstances while maintaining procedural consistency. Our results have important design implications for algorithmic decision-making processes that meet decision subjects’ standards of justice.

Making Sense of Post-match Fan Behaviors in the Online Football Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581310,1,,"
 Professional sports have large fan bases that congregate in online sports fan communities. The sports community is suitable to be a sandbox for studying offline context’s effects on online community behavior. By now, prior works did not present a detailed study on the offline-online connection by examining detailed community discussion content. To fill this gap, this work presents a comprehensive study of online communities’ comments about football (soccer) matches, grounded in the data from Premier League teams’ Reddit online communities during the 2020-2021 season. We propose a metric “gap score” to quantify offline events’ effects by measuring the gap between fans’ prematch expectations and actual match results. Using this metric, we investigated how team performance impacted comments’ sentiment, discussion topics, and the pattern of comments’ votes. The findings highlight the close connection that exists between offline events and online discussions and reveals both theoretical and practical implications for online communities.

In recent years, various initiatives from within and outside the HCI field have encouraged researchers to improve research ethics, openness, and transparency in their empirical research. We quantify how the CHI literature might have changed in these three aspects by analyzing samples of 118 CHI 2017 and 127 CHI 2022 papers—randomly drawn and stratified across conference sessions. We operationalized research ethics, openness, and transparency into 45  criteria and manually annotated the sampled papers. The results show that the CHI 2022 sample was better in 18 criteria, but in the rest of the criteria, it has no improvement. The most noticeable improvements were related to research transparency (10 out of 17 criteria). We also explored the possibility of assisting the verification process by developing a proof-of-concept screening system. We tested this tool with eight criteria. Six of them achieved high accuracy and F1 score. We discuss the implications for future research practices and education.

Chatbots have been designed to provide interventions in mental healthcare. However, how chatbot-based social contact can mitigate social stigma in mental illness remains under-explored. We designed two chatbots that deliver either first-person or third-person narratives about mental illness and evaluated them using a mixed methods study. Compared to a web survey group, participants in both chatbot groups decreased their beliefs that individuals are personally responsible for their mental illnesses, and increased their intentions to help. Additionally, participants in the first-person chatbot group showed a reduced level of fear, and a lower desire for social distance from people with mental illness. Many in the first-person chatbot group also reported a feeling of relationship with the chatbot, and chose to phrase their responses empathetically. Results demonstrated that chatbot-based social contact has promising potential for mitigating mental illness stigma. Implications for designing chatbot-based social contact are discussed.

In this paper, we use the customisation options offered by the displays of commercial fitness smartwatches as a lens to investigate when, why and how 386 self-trackers engage in customisations in their daily lives. We find that people largely customise their trackers’ display frequently, multiple times a day, or not at all, with frequent customisations reflecting situational data, aesthetic and personal meaning needs. We discuss implications for the design of tracking tools aiming to support customisation and discuss the utility of customisations towards goal scaffolding and maintaining interest in tracking.

 Visualization misinformation is a prevalent problem, and combating it requires understanding people’s ability to read, interpret, and reason about erroneous or potentially misleading visualizations, which lacks a reliable measurement: existing visualization literacy tests focus on well-formed visualizations. We systematically develop an assessment for this ability by: (1) developing a precise definition of misleaders (decisions made in the construction of visualizations that can lead to conclusions not supported by the data), (2) constructing initial test items using a design space of misleaders and chart types, (3) trying out the provisional test on 497 participants, and (4) analyzing the test tryout results and refining the items using Item Response Theory, qualitative analysis, a wrong-due-to-misleader score, and the content validity index. Our final bank of 45 items shows high reliability, and we provide item bank usage recommendations for future tests and different use cases. Related materials are available at: https://osf.io/pv67z/.

 Music can affect the human brain and cognition. Melodies and lyrics that resonate with us can awaken our inner feelings and thoughts; being in touch with these feelings and expressing them allow us to understand ourselves better and increase our self-awareness. To support self-awareness elicited by music, we designed a novel conversational agent (CA) that guides users to become self-aware and express their thoughts when they listen to music. Moreover, we investigated two prominent design factors in the CA, proactive guidance and social information. We then conducted a 2x2 between-subjects experiment (N = 90) to investigate how the two design factors affect self-awareness, user acceptance, and mental well-being. The results of a five-day user study reveal that high proactive guidance and social information increased self-awareness, but high proactive guidance tended to influence perceived autonomy and usefulness negatively. Further, users’ subjective feedback revealed the CA’s potential to support mental well-being.

Existing situated visualization models assume the user is able to directly interact with the objects and spaces to which the data refers (known as physical referents). We review a growing body of work exploring scenarios where the user interacts with a proxy representation of the physical referent rather than immediately with the object itself. This introduces a complex mixture of immediate situatedness and proxies of situatedness that goes beyond the expressiveness of current models. We propose an extended model of situated visualization that encompasses Immediate Situated Visualization and ProxSituated (Proxy of Situated) Visualization. Our model describes a set of key entities involved in proxSituated scenarios and important relationships between them. From this model, we derive design dimensions and apply them to existing situated visualization work. The resulting design space allows us to describe and evaluate existing scenarios, as well as to creatively generate new conceptual scenarios.

 Robot technologies have been introduced to computing education to engage learners. This study introduces the concept of co-creation with a robot agent into culturally-responsive computing (CRC).

Through participatory design activities, we positioned adolescent girls and an agentic social robot as co-creators of the robot’s identity. Taking a thematic analysis approach, we examined how girls embody the role of creator and co-creator in this space. We identified themes surrounding who has the power to make decisions, what decisions are made, and how to maintain social relationship. Our findings suggest that co-creation with robot technology is a promising implementation vehicle for realizing CRC.

 Lifelogging is traditionally used for memory augmentation. However, recent research shows that users’ trust in the completeness and accuracy of lifelogs might skew their memories. Privacy-protection alterations such as body blurring and content deletion are commonly applied to photos to circumvent capturing sensitive information. However, their impact on how users remember memories remain unclear. To this end, we conduct a white-hat memory attack and report on an iterative experiment (N=21) to compare the impact of viewing 1) unaltered lifelogs, 2) blurred lifelogs, and 3) a subset of the lifelogs after deleting private ones, on confidently remembering memories. Findings indicate that all the privacy methods impact memories’ quality similarly and that users tend to change their answers in recognition more than recall scenarios. Results also show that users have high confidence in their remembered content across all privacy methods. Our work raises awareness about the mindful designing of technological interventions.

 Challenges associated with ADHD affect children’s daily routines and response to environmental stimuli, and support from parents is helpful in managing and overcoming behavior regulation challenges. Positive reinforcement is increasingly integrated into family technologies for teaching regulation skills, but typically support specific co-located activities. To better understand how technology can support co-regulation within families with ADHD children, we deployed CoolTaco, a smartwatch and phone system to support collaboration in creating tasks, gaining points for achieving them, and redeeming rewards. Ten families with ADHD children used CoolTaco in their daily routines. By qualitatively analyzing family interviews and usage logs, we find that smartwatches can help provide pervasive regulation support to children, but the division across devices and parent-child roles interfere with developing independence. We discuss how technology should support co-regulation while also fostering future self-regulation, such as by guiding children in goal setting and helping them reflect on progress and achievements.

 Users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices sometimes find it difficult to communicate in real time with others due to the time it takes to compose messages. AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to support AAC users by improving the quality and variety of text suggestions. However, these technologies may fundamentally change how users interact with AAC devices as users transition from typing their own phrases to prompting and selecting AI-generated phrases. We conducted a study in which 12 AAC users tested live suggestions from a language model across three usage scenarios: extending short replies, answering biographical questions, and requesting assistance. Our study participants believed that AI-generated phrases could save time, physical and cognitive effort when communicating, but felt it was important that these phrases reflect their own communication style and preferences.

 For gamers, high frame rates are important for a smooth visual display and good quality of experience (QoE). However, high frame rates alone are not enough as variations in the frame display times can degrade QoE even as the average frame rate remains high. While the impact of steady frame rates on player QoE is fairly well-studied, the effects of frame rate variation is not. This paper presents a 33-person user study that evaluates the impact of frame rate variation on users playing three different computer games. Analysis of the results shows average frame rate alone is a poor predictor of QoE, and frame rate variation has a significant impact on player QoE. While the standard deviation of frame times is promising as a general predictor for QoE, frame time standard deviation may not be accurate for all individual games. However, 95% frame rate floor -– the bottom 5% of frame rates the player experiences –- appears to be an effective predictor of both QoE overall and for the individual games tested.

 Virtual Reality (VR) has a noteworthy educational potential by providing immersive and collaborative environments. As an alternative but cost-effective way of delivering realistic environments in VR, using 360-degree videos in immersive VR (VR videos) received more attention. Although many studies reported positive learning experiences with VR videos, little is known about how collaborative learning performs on VR video viewing systems. In this study, we implemented two collaborative VR video viewing modes based on the way of group video control, synchronized or shared (Sync mode) and non-synchronized or individual (Non-sync mode) video control, against a conventional VR video viewing setting (Basic mode). We conducted a within-subject study (N = 54) in a lab-simulated remote learning environment. Our results show that collaborative VR video modes (Sync and Non-sync mode) improve users’ learning experiences and collaboration quality, especially with shared video control. Our findings provide directions for designing and employing collaborative VR video tools in online learning environments.

"Tips, Tricks, and Training: Supporting Anti-Phishing Awareness among Mid-Career Office Workers Based on Employees' Current Practices",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580650,1,,"
 Preventing workplace phishing depends on the actions of every employee, regardless of cybersecurity expertise. Based on 24 semi-structured interviews with mid-career office workers (70.8% women, averaging 44 years old) at two U.S. universities, we found that less than 21% of our participants had any formal anti-phishing training. Much of what our participants know about phishing comes from informal sources that emphasize “tips” and ""tricks"" like those found in conversations with friends, news stories, newsletters, social media, and podcasts. These informal channels provide opportunities for IT professionals wishing to enhance employees’ anti-phishing awareness by better aligning the delivery of expert advice with employees’ current practices and desires. We provide four recommendations designed to embrace ""guerrilla learning"" by distributing anti-phishing educational resources across the workplace and workday in part to encourage the delivery of more accurate information in more informal and incidental ways, and greater dialogue between anti-phishing training instructors and learners.

OpenMic: Utilizing Proxemic Metaphors for Conversational Floor Transitions in Multiparty Video Meetings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581013,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581013,"
Turn-taking is one of the biggest interactivity challenges in multiparty remote meetings. One contributing factor is that current videoconferencing tools lack support for proxemic cues; i.e., spatial cues that humans use to enact their social relations and intentions. While more recent tools provide support for proxemic metaphors, they often focus on approach and leave-taking rather than turn-taking. In this paper, we present OpenMic, a videoconferencing system that utilizes proxemic metaphors for conversational floor management by providing 1) a Virtual Floor that serves as a fixed-feature space for users to be aware of others’ intention to talk, and 2) Malleable Mirrors, which are video and screen feeds that can be continuously moved and resized for conversational floor transitions. Our exploratory user study found that these system features can aid the conversational flow in multiparty video meetings. With this work, we show potential for embedding proxemic metaphors to support conversational floor management in videoconferencing systems.

Sensemaking is the iterative process of identifying, extracting, and explaining insights from data, where each iteration is referred to as the “sensemaking loop.” However, little is known about how sensemaking behavior evolves from exploration and explanation during this process. This gap limits our ability to understand the full scope of sensemaking, which in turn inhibits the design of tools that support the process. We contribute the first mixed-method to characterize how sensemaking evolves within computational notebooks. We study 2,574 Jupyter notebooks mined from GitHub by identifying data science notebooks that have undergone significant iterations, presenting a regression model that automatically characterizes sensemaking activity, and using this regression model to calculate and analyze shifts in activity across GitHub versions. Our results show that notebook authors participate in various sensemaking tasks over time, such as annotation, branching analysis, and documentation. We use our insights to recommend extensions to current notebook environments.

HOOV: Hand Out-Of-View Tracking for Proprioceptive Interaction using Inertial Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581468,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07016,"
 Current Virtual Reality systems are designed for interaction under visual control. Using built-in cameras, headsets track the user’s hands or hand-held controllers while they are inside the field of view. Current systems thus ignore the user’s interaction with off-screen content—virtual objects that the user could quickly access through proprioception without requiring laborious head motions to bring them into focus. In this paper, we present HOOV, a wrist-worn sensing method that allows VR users to interact with objects outside their field of view. Based on the signals of a single wrist-worn inertial sensor, HOOV continuously estimates the user’s hand position in 3-space to complement the headset’s tracking as the hands leave the tracking range. Our novel data-driven method predicts hand positions and trajectories from just the continuous estimation of hand orientation, which by itself is stable based solely on inertial observations. Our inertial sensing simultaneously detects finger pinching to register off-screen selection events, confirms them using a haptic actuator inside our wrist device, and thus allows users to select, grab, and drop virtual content. We compared HOOV’s performance with a camera-based optical motion capture system in two folds. In the first evaluation, participants interacted based on tracking information from the motion capture system to assess the accuracy of their proprioceptive input, whereas in the second, they interacted based on HOOV’s real-time estimations. We found that HOOV’s target-agnostic estimations had a mean tracking error of 7.7 cm, which allowed participants to reliably access virtual objects around their body without first bringing them into focus. We demonstrate several applications that leverage the larger input space HOOV opens up for quick proprioceptive interaction, and conclude by discussing the potential of our technique.

Through 10 co-design sessions with 53 children, we examined how children in the UK want to be supported to cope with the datafication practices. Our findings provide insights for creating age-appropriate support for children’s algorithmic literacy development, highlighting and unpacking the importance of no one-size-fitting-all designs to support children’s coping with datafication.

Regardless of which community, incentivizing users is a necessity for well-sustainable operations. In the blockchain-backed Web3 communities, known for their transparency and security, airdrop serves as a widespread incentive mechanism for allocating capital and power. However, it remains a controversy on how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized governance. In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction with the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization, and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities.

Data physicalisation is a technique that encodes data through the geometric and material properties of an artefact, allowing users to engage with data in a more immersive and multi-sensory way. However, current methods of data physicalisation are limited in terms of their reconfigurability and the types of materials that can be used. Acoustophoresis—a method of suspending and manipulating materials using sound waves—offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we present DataLev, a design space and platform for creating reconfigurable, multimodal data physicalisations with enriched materiality using acoustophoresis. We demonstrate the capabilities of DataLev through eight examples and evaluate its performance in terms of reconfigurability and materiality. Our work offers a new approach to data physicalisation, enabling designers to create more dynamic, engaging, and expressive artefacts.

In order to investigate these gaps in adoption, we conducted interviews with ten older adults in a long-term care community who have adopted Alexa devices for at least one year. Participants learned to use Alexa through a training program that encouraged exploration. They used Alexa to complement their daily routines, improve their mood, engage in cognitively stimulating activities, and support socialization with others. We discuss our findings in the context of prior work, describe strategies to promote VA learning and adoption, and present design recommendations to support aging.

We deployed TactorBots to thirteen designers and researchers to validate its functionality, characterize its design experience, and analyze what, how, and why alternative perceptions, practices, contexts, and metaphors would emerge in the experiment. We provide suggestions for designing future toolkits and field studies based on our experiences. Reflecting on the findings, we derive design implications for further enhancing the ambiguity and shifting the mindsets to expand the design space.

Critical scholarship has elevated the problem of gender bias in data sets used to train virtual assistants (VAs). Most work has focused on explicit biases in language, especially against women, girls, femme-identifying people, and genderqueer folk; implicit associations through word embeddings; and limited models of gender and masculinities, especially toxic masculinities, conflation of sex and gender, and a sex/gender binary framing of the masculine as diametric to the feminine. Yet, we must also interrogate how masculinities are “coded” into language and the assumption of “male” as the linguistic default: implicit masculine biases. To this end, we examined two natural language processing (NLP) data sets. We found that when gendered language was present, so were gender biases and especially masculine biases. Moreover, these biases related in nuanced ways to the NLP context. We offer a new dictionary called AVA that covers ambiguous associations between gendered language and the language of VAs.

 Tracking body pose on-the-go could have powerful uses in fitness, mobile gaming, context-aware virtual assistants, and rehabilitation. However, users are unlikely to buy and wear special suits or sensor arrays to achieve this end. Instead, in this work, we explore the feasibility of estimating body pose using IMUs already in devices that many users own — namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds. This approach has several challenges, including noisy data from low-cost commodity IMUs, and the fact that the number of instrumentation points on a user’s body is both sparse and in flux. Our pipeline receives whatever subset of IMU data is available, potentially from just a single device, and produces a best-guess pose. To evaluate our model, we created the IMUPoser Dataset, collected from 10 participants wearing or holding off-the-shelf consumer devices and across a variety of activity contexts. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our system, benchmarking it on both our own and existing IMU datasets.

“AI as a Service” (AIaaS) is a rapidly growing market, offering various plug-and-play AI services and tools. AIaaS enables its customers (users)—who may lack the expertise, data, and/or resources to develop their own systems—to easily build and integrate AI capabilities into their applications. Yet, it is known that AI systems can encapsulate biases and inequalities that can have societal impact. This paper argues that the context-sensitive nature of fairness is often incompatible with AIaaS’ ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, leading to issues and tensions. Specifically, we review and systematise the AIaaS space by proposing a taxonomy of AI services based on the levels of autonomy afforded to the user. We then critically examine the different categories of AIaaS, outlining how these services can lead to biases or be otherwise harmful in the context of end-user applications. In doing so, we seek to draw research attention to the challenges of this emerging area.

filtered. ink: Creating Dynamic Illustrations with SVG Filters,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581051,1,,"
 Vector illustrations are object-based, meaning they are composed of strokes that can be filtered individually through textures or animations and transformed without loss of quality. These filters are typically difficult to specify without programming prerequisites. We propose filtered.ink , a full-featured illustration application to construct and explore filters via a node graph interface with a live preview. This turns vector graphics and their filters into a form of vector hypermedia that can be shared and remixed with new users. By examining interactions that occur when crafting, remixing, and using filters for dynamic illustrations through a task-based usability study, we expose new workflow patterns and avenues of expression. The observations result in a user model supported by filtered.ink: see, want, rewant, and remix. In this model, the artist breaks away from traditional notions of illustration, taking advantage of the inherent remixability of the strokes and filters in the vector graphics format.

Exploring virtual worlds together with others adds a social component to the Virtual Reality (VR) experience that increases connectedness. In the physical world, joint locomotion comes naturally through implicit intention communication and subsequent adjustments of the movement patterns. In VR, however, discrete locomotion techniques such as point&teleport come without prior intention communication, hampering the collective experience. Related work proposes fixed groups, with a single person controlling the group movement, resulting in the loss of individual movement capabilities. To close the gap and mediate between these two extremes, we introduce three intention communication methods and explore them with two baseline methods. We contribute the results of a controlled experiment (n=20) investigating these methods from the perspective of a leader and a follower in a dyadic locomotion task. Our results suggest shared visualizations support the understanding of movement intentions, increasing the group feeling while maintaining individual freedom of movement.

Measuring categorical perception in color-coded scatterplots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581416,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15583,"
 Scatterplots commonly use color to encode categorical data. However, as datasets increase in size and complexity, the efficacy of these channels may vary. Designers lack insight into how robust different design choices are to variations in category numbers. This paper presents a crowdsourced experiment measuring how the number of categories and choice of color encodings used in multiclass scatterplots influences the viewers’ abilities to analyze data across classes. Participants estimated relative means in a series of scatterplots with 2 to 10 categories encoded using ten color palettes drawn from popular design tools. Our results show that the number of categories and color discriminability within a color palette notably impact people’s perception of categorical data in scatterplots and that the judgments become harder as the number of categories grows. We examine existing palette design heuristics in light of our results to help designers make robust color choices informed by the parameters of their data.

Legitimate interest is one of the six grounds for processing data under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The flexibility and ambiguity of the term ""legitimate interests"" can be problematic; coupled with the lack of enforcement from legal authorities and different interpretations from the various data protection authorities, legitimate interests can be taken advantage of as a loophole to collect more user data.  Drawing insights from multiple disciplines, we ran two studies to empirically investigate the deceptive designs being used when legitimate interests are applied in privacy notices, and how user perceptions line up with these practices. We identified six deceptive designs, and found that the ways legitimate interest is applied in practice does not match user expectations.

 Inflatable systems have been attracting attention in the field of interaction design. Conventional tabletop-sized pneumatic systems tend to be complex because they require bulky and noisy equipment. Therefore, several liquid-to-gas phase change actuators that use vaporization have been proposed. But these actuators have problems with controllability, reusability, and reconfigurability. In this study, we propose InflatableMod, novel inflatable modules based on the efficient control of liquid-to-gas phase change actuators. These are designed with a compact circuit that has a liquid transfer function to feed the required amount of low-boiling-point liquid into the pouch and a heating function to inflate the pouch by the volume change. This approach allows for a compact, silent, and untethered inflatable system. It is also possible to create an untethered and reconfigurable multi-inflatable system because each module is synchronized. In this paper, we propose the design of the modules, evaluate their performance, and present application scenarios.

Slide4N leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to distill key information from user-selected notebook cells and then renders them in appropriate slide layouts.

 Virtual Reality (VR) allows us to replace our visible body with a virtual self-representation (avatar) and to explore its effects on our body perception.

Forty participants performed moving meditation tasks in reality and VR, either facing their mirror image or not. Both the virtual environment and avatars photorealistically matched their real counterparts. We found a negative effect of VR on body awareness, mediated by feeling embodied in and changed by the avatar. Further, we revealed a negative effect of a mirror on body awareness. Our results indicate that assessing body awareness should be essential in evaluating VR designs and avatar embodiment aiming at mental health, as even a scenario as close to reality as possible can distract users from their internal body signals.

 Trust has been recognized as a central variable to explain the resistance to using automated systems (under-trust) and the overreliance on automated systems (over-trust). To achieve appropriate reliance, users’ trust should be calibrated to reflect a system’s capabilities. Studies from various disciplines have examined different interventions to attain such trust calibration. Based on a literature body of 1000+ papers, we identified 96 relevant publications which aimed to calibrate users’ trust in automated systems. To provide an in-depth overview of the state-of-the-art, we reviewed and summarized measurements of the trust calibration, interventions, and results of these efforts. For the numerous promising calibration interventions, we extract common design choices and structure these into four dimensions of trust calibration interventions to guide future studies. Our findings indicate that the measurement of the trust calibration often limits the interpretation of the effects of different interventions. We suggest future directions for this problem.

Early autobiographical design work focused on designing for ’sustainability’ revealed a trajectory of fatalism and restriction. A turn towards enacting material relations, co-performed with others, opened into a more holistic relationship with energy. Reflecting on how this process unfolded, we argue that sustainability is not, in itself, a somaesthetic sensibility, and remains constrained within rational framings. We develop this argument to contribute to a new understanding of how we somatically relate to energy and how relational ethics in interaction design research and practice can encourage a felt sense for the materiality of energy.

From User Perceptions to Technical Improvement: Enabling People Who Stutter to Better Use Speech Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581224,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581224,"
 Consumer speech recognition systems do not work as well for many people with speech differences, such as stuttering, relative to the rest of the general population. However, what is not clear is the degree to which these systems do not work, how they can be improved, or how much people want to use them. In this paper, we first address these questions using results from a 61-person survey from people who stutter and find participants want to use speech recognition but are frequently cut off, misunderstood, or speech predictions do not represent intent. In a second study, where 91 people who stutter recorded voice assistant commands and dictation, we quantify how dysfluencies impede performance in a consumer-grade speech recognition system. Through three technical investigations, we demonstrate how many common errors can be prevented, resulting in a system that cuts utterances off 79.1% less often and improves word error rate from 25.4% to 9.9%.

Re-evaluating vr user awareness needs during bystander interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581018,1,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/292284/1/292284.pdf,"
 Virtual reality (VR) users are often around bystanders, i.e. people in the real world the VR user may want to interact with. To facilitate bystander-VR user interactions, technology-mediated awareness systems have been introduced to increase a user’s awareness of bystanders. However, while prior works have found effective means of facilitating bystander-VR user interactions, it is unclear when and why one awareness system should be used over another. We reviewed, and selected, a breadth of bystander awareness systems from the literature and investigated their usability, and how they could be holistically used together to support varying awareness needs across 14 bystander-VR user interactions. Our results demonstrate VR users do not manage bystander awareness based solely on the usability of awareness systems but rather on the demands of social context weighted against desired immersion in VR (something existing evaluations fail to capture) and show the need for socially intelligent bystander awareness systems.

Assessing enactment of content regulation policies: A post hoc crowd-sourced audit of election misinformation on YouTube,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580846,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580846,"
 With the 2022 US midterm elections approaching, conspiratorial claims about the 2020 presidential elections continue to threaten users’ trust in the electoral process. To regulate election misinformation, YouTube introduced policies to remove such content from its searches and recommendations. In this paper, we conduct a 9-day crowd-sourced audit on YouTube to assess the extent of enactment of such policies. We recruited 99 users who installed a browser extension that enabled us to collect up-next recommendation trails and search results for 45 videos and 88 search queries about the 2020 elections. We find that YouTube’s search results, irrespective of search query bias, contain more videos that oppose rather than support election misinformation. However, watching misinformative election videos still lead users to a small number of misinformative videos in the up-next trails. Our results imply that while YouTube largely seems successful in regulating election misinformation, there is still room for improvement.

The Elements of Visual Art Recommendation: Learning Latent Semantic Representations of Paintings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581477,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581477,"
Artwork recommendation is challenging because it requires understanding how users interact with highly subjective content, the complexity of the concepts embedded within the artwork, and the emotional and cognitive reflections they may trigger in users. In this paper, we focus on efficiently capturing the elements (i.e., latent semantic relationships) of visual art for personalized recommendation. We propose and study recommender systems based on textual and visual feature learning techniques, as well as their combinations. We then perform a small-scale and a large-scale user-centric evaluation of the quality of the recommendations. Our results indicate that textual features compare favourably with visual ones, whereas a fusion of both captures the most suitable hidden semantic relationships for artwork recommendation. Ultimately, this paper contributes to our understanding of how to deliver content that suitably matches the user’s interests and how they are perceived.

Notable: On-the-fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580965,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04059,"
 Computational notebooks are widely used for data analysis. Their interleaved displays of code and execution results (e.g., visualizations) are welcomed since they enable iterative analysis and preserve the exploration process. However, the communication of data findings remains challenging in computational notebooks. Users have to carefully identify useful findings from useless ones, document them with texts and visual embellishments, and then organize them in different tools. Such workflow greatly increases their workload, according to our interviews with practitioners. To address the challenge, we designed Notable to offer on-the-fly assistance for data storytelling in computational notebooks. It provides intelligent support to minimize the work of documenting and organizing data findings and diminishes the cost of switching between data exploration and storytelling. To evaluate Notable, we conducted a user study with 12 data workers. The feedback from user study participants verifies its effectiveness and usability.

"The “Three-Legged Stool"": Designing for Equitable City, Community, and Research Partnerships in Urban Environmental Sensing",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581289,1,,"
 Urban environmental monitoring campaigns depend on expertise from city agencies, residents, and researchers. Deployment efforts rarely include all three stakeholders, typically leading to initiatives that struggle to produce credible, actionable data. We describe the implementation of a large-scale, long-term air quality sensing network in Chicago  Illinois; detail stakeholder interviews and meetings; and present three interfaces—–a website accessible via in-situ QR codes, APIs, and a mobile, mixed-media experience. We show how a collaborative approach created a more equitable sensor distribution compared to crowdsourced or regulatory designs. We highlight shared goals of education, engagement, and empowerment despite the diversity of tool and analytics needs across stakeholder groups. Reflecting on our work, we develop a “three-legged stool” framework representing the criticality of balanced participation from three key stakeholder groups—city, community, and research—in deploying novel urban technologies. This approach can help HCI researchers facilitate more democratic technology deployments in urban spaces.

Much HCI research on prompting prosocial behaviors focuses on methods for increasing empathy. However, increased empathy may have unintended negative consequences. Our work offers an alternative solution that encourages critical reflection for nurturing compassion, which involves motivation and action to help others. In a between-subject experiment, participants (N=60) viewed a climate change documentary while receiving no prompts (CON), reflective prompts to focus on their emotions (RE) or surprises (RS). State compassion, critical reflection, and motivation to act or learn were measured at the end of the session (post-video) and two weeks later (follow-up). Despite participants’ condition not affecting compassion, critical reflection was positively correlated with post-video state compassion. RE and RS participants demonstrated deeper reflection and reported higher motivation to learn post-video, and more prosocial behavioral changes during follow-up. RS participants reported better follow-up recall than RE participants. We conclude by discussing implications on designing technology to support compassion and longer-term critical reflection.

 Inappropriate design and deployment of machine learning (ML) systems lead to negative downstream social and ethical impacts – described here as social and ethical risks – for users, society, and the environment. Despite the growing need to regulate ML systems, current processes for assessing and mitigating risks are disjointed and inconsistent. We interviewed 30 industry practitioners on their current social and ethical risk management practices and collected their first reactions on adapting safety engineering frameworks into their practice – namely, System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Our findings suggest STPA/FMEA can provide an appropriate structure for social and ethical risk assessment and mitigation processes. However, we also find nontrivial challenges in integrating such frameworks in the fast-paced culture of the ML industry. We call on the CHI community to strengthen existing frameworks and assess their efficacy, ensuring that ML systems are safer for all people.

 User experience (UX) has undergone a revolution in collaborative practices, due to tools that enable quick feedback and continuous collaboration with a varied team across a design’s lifecycle. However, it is unclear how this shift in collaboration has been received in professional UX practice, and whether new pain points have arisen. To this end, we conducted a survey (N = 114) with UX practitioners at software organizations based in the U.S. to better understand their collaborative practices and tools used throughout the design process. We found that while an increase in collaborative activity enhanced many aspects of UX work, some long-standing challenges—such as handing off designs to developers—still persist. Moreover, we observed new challenges emerging from activities enabled by collaborative tools such as design system management. Based on our findings, we discuss how UX practices can improve collaboration moving forward and provide concrete design implications for collaborative UX tools.

 Logging is a widely used technique for inspecting and understanding programs. However, the presentation of logs still often takes its ancient form of a linear stream of text that resides in a terminal, console, or log file. Despite its simplicity, interpreting log output is often challenging due to the large number of textual logs that lack structure and context. We conducted content analysis and expert interviews to understand the practices and challenges inherent in logging. These activities demonstrated that the current representation of logs does not provide the rich structures programmers need to interpret them or the program’s behavior. We present Log-it, a logging interface that enables programmers to interactively structure and visualize logs in situ. A user study with novices and experts showed that Log-it’s syntax and interface have a minimal learning curve, and the interactive representations and organizations of logs help programmers easily locate, synthesize, and understand logs.

When we get lost in Virtual Reality (VR) or want to return to a previous location, we use the same methods of locomotion for the way back as for the way forward. This is time-consuming and requires additional physical orientation changes, increasing the risk of getting tangled in the headsets’ cables. In this paper, we propose the use of undo actions to revert locomotion steps in VR. We explore eight different variations of undo actions as extensions of point&teleport, based on the possibility to undo position and orientation changes together with two different visualizations of the undo step (discrete and continuous). We contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 24 participants investigating the efficiency and orientation of the undo techniques in a radial maze task. We found that the combination of position and orientation undo together with a discrete visualization resulted in the highest efficiency without increasing orientation errors.

 Causal inference is a statistical paradigm for quantifying causal effects using observational data. It is a complex process, requiring multiple steps, iterations, and collaborations with domain experts. Analysts often rely on visualizations to evaluate the accuracy of each step. However, existing visualization toolkits are not designed to support the entire causal inference process within computational environments familiar to analysts. In this paper, we address this gap with Causalvis, a Python visualization package for causal inference. Working closely with causal inference experts, we adopted an iterative design process to develop four interactive visualization modules to support causal inference analysis tasks. The modules are then presented back to the experts for feedback and evaluation. We found that Causalvis effectively supported the iterative causal inference process. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing visualizations for causal inference, particularly for tasks of communication and collaboration.

While walking meetings offer a healthy alternative to sit-down meetings, they also pose practical challenges. Taking notes is difficult while walking, which limits the potential of walking meetings.

We investigated our system in a three-condition between-subjects user study with thirty pairs of participants (N=60) who conducted 15-minute outdoor walking meetings. Participants either used clip-on microphones, the prototype without the button, or the prototype with the highlighting button. We found that the tangible device increased task focus, and the physical highlighting button facilitated turn-taking and resulted in more useful notes. Our work demonstrates how interactive artifacts can incentivize users to hold meetings in motion and enhance conversation dynamics. We contribute insights for future systems which support conducting work tasks in mobile environments.

 Presence is one of the most studied and most important variables in immersive virtual reality (VR) and it influences the effectiveness of many VR applications. Separate bodies of research indicate that presence is determined by (1) technical factors such as the visual realism of a virtual environment (VE) and the field of view (FoV), and (2) human factors such as emotions and agency. However, it remains unknown how technical and human factors may interact in the presence formation process. We conducted a user study (n=360) to investigate the effects of visual realism (high/low), FoV (high/low), emotions (focusing on fear) and agency (yes/no) on presence. Counter to previous assumptions, technical factors did not affect presence directly but were moderated through human factors. We propose TAP-Fear, a structural equation model that describes how design decisions, technical factors and human factors combine and interact in the formation of presence.

In this study, we explore the potential benefits and risks of such a practice, through semi-structured interviews with 10 mourners who actively used chatbots at different phases of their loss. Our findings indicated seven approaches in which chatbots were used to help people cope with grief, by taking the role of listener, acting as a simulation of the deceased, romantic partner, friend and emotion coach. We then highlight how interacting with the chatbots impacted mourners’ grief experience, and conclude the paper with further research opportunities.

The smart rooms and controls are potentially transformative for patients with reduced motor function, helping them regain lost independence and control of their surroundings. Through semi-structured interviews, we explore how smart home technology deployed in patient rooms: interacts with patients’ needs, presents new challenges, and fits into the hospital context. We identify a range of considerations that inform how hospitals can integrate smart technology into their environment, including technology design considerations and adjustments to how hospital staff supports its use.

We introduce the first HCI study of Library of Things by interviewing 23 librarians who run a variety of collections such as handheld tools, gear, and musical instruments – within public institutions and more grass-roots efforts in the private sector. In our findings, we discuss the challenges these collections experience in changing behavioural patterns from buying to borrowing, helping individuals ‘try new things’, iterating to find sharable items, training staff, and manual intervention throughout the borrowing cycle. We present 5 opportunities for HCI research to support interactive skill-sharing, self-borrowing, maintenance recognition and cataloguing ‘things’, organizing non-uniform inventories, and creating public-awareness. Further in-the-wild studies should also consider the tensions between the values of these organizations and low-cost convenient usage.

We interview 18 practitioners by probing them with a carefully crafted failure handling scenario. We observe that there is a great diversity of failure handling workflows in which cooperations are often necessary, that practitioners overlook certain types of failures and bugs, and that they generally do not rely on potentially relevant approaches and tools originally stemming from research. These insights allow to draw a list of research opportunities, such as creating a library of best practices and more representative formalisations of practitioners’ goals, developing interfaces to exploit failure handling artifacts, as well as providing specialized training.

 Risk assessment algorithms are being adopted by public sector agencies to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. Algorithms model “risk” based on individual client characteristics to identify clients most in need. However, this understanding of risk is primarily based on easily quantifiable risk factors that present an incomplete and biased perspective of clients. We conducted a computational narrative analysis of child-welfare casenotes and draw attention to deeper systemic risk factors that are hard to quantify but directly impact families and street-level decision-making. We found that beyond individual risk factors, the system itself poses a significant amount of risk where parents are over-surveilled by caseworkers and lack agency in decision-making processes. We also problematize the notion of risk as a static construct by highlighting the temporality and mediating effects of different risk, protective, systemic, and procedural factors. Finally, we draw caution against using casenotes in NLP-based systems by unpacking their limitations and biases embedded within them.

 The use of algorithms for decision-making in higher education is steadily growing, promising cost-savings to institutions and personalized service for students but also raising ethical challenges around surveillance, fairness, and interpretation of data. To address the lack of systematic understanding of how these algorithms are currently designed, we reviewed an extensive corpus of papers proposing algorithms for decision-making in higher education. We categorized them based on input data, computational method, and target outcome, and then investigated the interrelations of these factors with the application of human-centered lenses: theoretical, participatory, or speculative design. We found that the models are trending towards deep learning, and increased use of student personal data and protected attributes, with the target scope expanding towards automated decisions. However, despite the associated decrease in interpretability and explainability, current development predominantly fails to incorporate human-centered lenses. We discuss the challenges with these trends and advocate for a human-centered approach.

 We examine the feasibility of using accelerometer data exclusively collected during typing on a custom smartphone keyboard to study whether typing dynamics are associated with daily variations in mood and cognition. As part of an ongoing digital mental health study involving mood disorders, we collected data from a well-characterized clinical sample (N = 85) and classified accelerometer data per typing session into orientation (upright vs. not) and motion (active vs. not). The mood disorder group showed lower cognitive performance despite mild symptoms (depression/mania). There were also diurnal pattern differences with respect to cognitive performance: individuals with higher cognitive performance typed faster and were less sensitive to time of day. They also exhibited more well-defined diurnal patterns in smartphone keyboard usage: they engaged with the keyboard more during the day and tapered their usage more at night compared to those with lower cognitive performance, suggesting a healthier usage of their phone.

In a controlled experiment (N=108), we randomly assigned Black and white participants to interact with a voice assistant pre-programmed to exhibit a high versus low error rate. Results revealed that Black participants in the high error rate condition, compared to Black participants in the low error rate condition, exhibited significantly higher levels of self-consciousness, lower levels of self-esteem and positive affect, and less favorable ratings of the technology. White participants did not exhibit this disparate pattern. We discuss design implications and the diverse research directions to which this initial study aims to contribute.

In this study, we conduct interviews with 19 data practitioners who are non-experts in DP as they use a DP data analysis prototype to release privacy-preserving statistics about sensitive data, in order to understand perceptions, challenges, and opportunities around using DP. We find that while DP is promising for providing wider access to sensitive datasets, it also introduces challenges into every stage of the data science workflow. We identify ethics and governance questions that arise when socializing data scientists around new privacy constraints and offer suggestions to better integrate DP and data science.

"Supporting aim assistance algorithms through a rapidly trainable, personalized model of players' spatial and temporal aiming ability",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581293,1,https://equis.cs.queensu.ca/~equis/pubs/2023/schneider-chi-2023.pdf,"
 Multiplayer digital games can use aim assistance to help people with different levels of aiming ability to play together.  To dynamically provide each player with the right amount of assistance, an aim assistance algorithm needs a model of the player’s ability that can be measured and updated during gameplay. The model must be based on difficulty parameters such as target speed, size, and duration, that can be adjusted in-game to change aiming difficulty, and must account for player’s spatial and temporal aiming abilities.  To satisfy these requirements, we present the novel dynamic spatiotemporal model of a player’s aiming ability, based on difficulty parameters that can be manipulated in a game. In a crowdsourced experiment with 72 participants, the model was found to accurately predict how close to a target a player can aim and to converge rapidly with a small set of observations of aiming tasks.

PathFinder: Designing a Map-less Navigation System for Blind People in Unfamiliar Buildings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580687,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Masaki_Kuribayashi/publication/370133731_PathFinder_Designing_a_Map-less_Navigation_System_for_Blind_People_in_Unfamiliar_Buildings/links/64416e977c2814701ff85f0b/PathFinder-Designing-a-Map-less-Navigation-System-for-Blind-People-in-Unfamiliar-Buildings.pdf,"
Indoor navigation systems with prebuilt maps have shown great potential in navigating blind people even in unfamiliar buildings. However, blind people cannot always benefit from them in every building, as prebuilt maps are expensive to build. This paper explores a map-less navigation system for blind people to reach destinations in unfamiliar buildings, which is implemented on a robot. We first conducted a participatory design with five blind people, which revealed that intersections and signs are the most relevant information in unfamiliar buildings. Then, we prototyped PathFinder, a navigation system that allows blind people to determine their way by detecting and conveying information about intersections and signs. Through a participatory study, we improved the interface of PathFinder, such as the feedback for conveying the detection results. Finally, a study with seven blind participants validated that PathFinder could assist users in navigating unfamiliar buildings with increased confidence compared to their regular aid.

Assessing Mapper Conflict in OpenStreetMap Using the Delphi Survey Method,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580758,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580758?trk=public_post_comment-text,"
Studies of mapper conflict in OpenStreetMap (OSM) have focused exclusively on cartographic vandalism and its effect on data quality. This paper takes a broader view on mapper conflict in OSM. Using a Delphi survey method, we collect qualitative data on perceived conflict from long-time OSM mappers. We ask mappers about four aspects of conflict in OSM: (1) topic of conflict, (2) factors leading to conflict, (3) effects of conflict, and (4) potential conflict management methods. Our results show that conflict in OSM can be explained by clashing values and opinions within and across different mapper subgroups and can be exacerbated by negative mapper behaviors. The boundaries of these subgroups, while implicit, are often defined by gender, mappers’ geographic location, level of expertise, and mappers’ professional affiliation. Based on these results, we discuss design options for OSM’s existing public communication channels that often become foci of mapper conflict management.

Geocamera: Telling stories in geographic visualizations with camera movements,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581470,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06460,"
In geographic data videos, camera movements are frequently used and combined to present information from multiple perspectives. However, creating and editing camera movements requires significant time and professional skills. This work aims to lower the barrier of crafting diverse camera movements for geographic data videos. First, we analyze a corpus of 66 geographic data videos and derive a design space of camera movements with a dimension for geospatial targets and one for narrative purposes. Based on the design space, we propose a set of adaptive camera shots and further develop an interactive tool called GeoCamera. This interactive tool allows users to flexibly design camera movements for geographic visualizations. We verify the expressiveness of our tool through case studies and evaluate its usability with a user study. The participants find that the tool facilitates the design of camera movements.

 Extracting underlying data from rasterized charts is tedious and inaccurate; values might be partially occluded or hard to distinguish, and the quality of the image limits the precision of the data being recovered. To address these issues, we introduce a semi-automatic system leveraging vector charts to extract the underlying data easily and accurately. The system is designed to make the most of vector information by relying on a drag-and-drop interface combined with selection, filtering, and previsualization features. A user study showed that participants spent less than 4 minutes to accurately recover data from charts published at CHI with diverse styles, thousands of data points, a combination of different encodings, and elements partially or completely occluded. Compared to other approaches relying on raster images, our tool successfully recovered all data, even when hidden, with a 78% lower relative error.

Through their eyes and in their shoes: Providing group awareness during collaboration across virtual reality and desktop platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581093,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581093,"
 Many collaborative data analysis situations benefit from collaborators utilizing different platforms. However, maintaining group awareness between team members using diverging devices is difficult, not least because common ground diminishes. A person using head-mounted VR cannot physically see a user on a desktop computer even while co-located, and the desktop user cannot easily relate to the VR user’s 3D workspace. To address this, we propose the “eyes-and-shoes” principles for group awareness and abstract them into four levels of techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate these principles with a qualitative user study of 6 participant pairs synchronously collaborating across distributed desktop and VR head-mounted devices. In this study, we vary the group awareness techniques between participants and explore two visualization contexts within participants. The results of this study indicate that the more visual metaphors and views of participants diverge, the greater the level of group awareness is needed.

Understanding perception of human augmentation: A mixed-method study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581485,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581485,"
Technologies that help users overcome their limitations and integrate with the human body are often termed “human augmentations”. Such technologies are now available on the consumer market, potentially supporting people in their everyday activities. To date, there is no systematic understanding of the perception of human augmentations yet. To address this gap and build an understanding of how to design positive experiences with human augmentations, we conducted a mixed-method study of the perception of augmented humans (AHs). We conducted two scenario-based studies: interviews (n = 16) and an online study (n = 506) with participants from four countries. The scenarios include one out of three augmentation categories (sensory, motor, and cognitive) and specify if the augmented person has a disability or not. Overall, results show that the type of augmentation and disability impacted user attitudes towards AHs. We derive design dimensions for creating technological augmentations for a diverse and global audience.

FabTouch: A tool to enable communication and design of tactile and affective fabric experiences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581288,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3544548.3581288,"
 The tactile experience of fabric is not only a sensory experience but also an affective one. Our choice of fabric products, like clothing, is often based on how they feel. Effectively communicating such experiences is crucial for designing tactile fabric experiences. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of the fabric tactile and affective experiences, preventing the development of tools to facilitate the communication of these experiences. In this paper, we examine the fabric experiences of 27 participants towards nine cotton samples. We combine qualitative and quantitative methods to create FabTouch, a novel tool to facilitate a dialogue in the design of fabric experiences. We found six phases of fabric touch experiences including fabric touch responses, sensory associations, and emotional responses. Initial feedback from designers suggested that FabTouch could enrich design processes both in practice and in education and can create inspiration for physical and digital design explorations.

Dancing with the Avatars: Minimal Avatar Customisation Enhances Learning in a Psychomotor Task,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580944,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580944,"
 Virtual environments can support psychomotor learning by allowing learners to observe instructor avatars. Instructor avatars that look like the learner hold promise in enhancing learning; however, it is unclear whether this works for psychomotor tasks and how similar avatars need to be. We investigated ‘minimal’ customisation of instructor avatars, approximating a learner’s appearance by matching only key visual features: gender, skin-tone, and hair colour. These avatars can be created easily and avoid problems of highly similar avatars. Using modern dancing as a skill to learn, we compared the effects of visually similar and dissimilar avatars, considering both learning on a screen (n=59) and in VR (n=38). Our results indicate that minimal avatar customisation leads to significantly more vivid visual imagery of the dance moves than dissimilar avatars. We analyse variables affecting interindividual differences, discuss the results in relation to theory, and derive design implications for psychomotor training in virtual environments.

 Assessing the trustworthiness of information online is complicated. Literacy-based paradigms are both widely used to help and widely critiqued. We conducted a study with 35 Gen Zers from across the U.S. to understand how they assess information online. We found that they tended to encounter—rather than search for—information, and that those encounters were shaped more by social motivations than by truth-seeking queries. For them, information processing is fundamentally a social practice. Gen Zers interpreted online information together, as aspirational members of social groups. Our participants sought information sensibility: a socially-informed awareness of the value of information encountered online. We outline key challenges they faced and practices they used to make sense of information. Our findings suggest that like their information sensibility practices, solutions and strategies to address misinformation should be embedded in social contexts online.

 Measuring perceived challenge and demand in video games is crucial as these player experiences are essential to creating enjoyable games. Two recent measures that identified seemingly distinct structures of challenge (Challenge Originating from Recent Gameplay Interaction Scale (CORGIS) - cognitive, emotional, performative, decision-making) and demand (Video Game Demand Scale (VGDS) - cognitive, emotional, controller, exertional, social) have been theorised to overlap, reflecting the five-factor demand structure. To investigate the overlap between these two scales we compared a five (complete overlap) and nine-factor (no overlap) model by surveying 1,101 players asking them to recall their last gaming experience before completing CORGIS and VGDS. After failing to confirm both models, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis. Our findings reveal seven dimensions, where the five-factor VGDS model holds alongside two additional CORGIS dimensions of performative and decision-making, ultimately providing a more holistic understanding of the concepts whilst highlighting unique aspects of each approach.

 Guiding robots, in the form of canes or cars, have recently been explored to assist blind and low vision (BLV) people. Such robots can provide full or partial autonomy when guiding. However, the pros and cons of different forms and autonomy for guiding robots remain unknown. We sought to fill this gap. We designed autonomy-switchable guiding robotic cane and car. We conducted a controlled lab-study (N=12) and a field study (N=9) on BLV. Results showed that full autonomy received better walking performance and subjective ratings in the controlled study, whereas participants used more partial autonomy in the natural environment as demanding more control. Besides, the car robot has demonstrated abilities to provide a higher sense of safety and navigation efficiency compared with the cane robot. Our findings offered empirical evidence about how the BLV community perceived different machine forms and autonomy, which can inform the design of assistive robots.

To examine how such differences affect the way users look at UIs, we collected and analyzed a large eye-tracking-based dataset, UEyes (62 participants and 1,980 UI screenshots), covering four major UI types: webpage, desktop UI, mobile UI, and poster. We analyze its differences in biases related to such factors as color, location, and gaze direction. We also compare state-of-the-art predictive models and propose improvements for better capturing typical tendencies across UI types. Both the dataset and the models are publicly available.

 Self-managing a chronic condition involves adapting management strategies to life’s continual change. Among these changes, moments of significant life transition can render routine self-management practices obsolete without significant modification to the new context. In this study, we examine one significant life transition for young adults living with Type 1 Diabetes, the move from home to university, to understand how near future AI-enhanced technologies might provide opportunities and challenges for supporting care. From interviews with 24 students in the UK who had moved away from their childhood homes, we used sensemaking literature to frame the process of initial disruption to the rebuilding of self-care practices around a new lifestyle and support networks. By studying a significant life transition, we uncover implications for the design of T1D technology, particularly closed-loop systems, through AI enhancements and human-centred design approaches, then extrapolate for other significant life transitions and chronic conditions.

Recent technological advances are enabling HCI researchers to explore interaction possibilities for remote XR collaboration using high-fidelity reconstructions of physical activity spaces. However, creating these reconstructions often lacks user involvement with an overt focus on capturing sensory context that does not necessarily augment an informal social experience. This work seeks to understand social context that can be important for reconstruction to enable XR applications for informal instructional scenarios. Our study involved the evaluation of an XR remote guidance prototype by 8 intergenerational groups of closely related gardeners using reconstructions of personally meaningful spaces in their gardens. Our findings contextualize physical objects and areas with various motivations related to gardening and detail perceptions of XR that might affect the use of reconstructions for remote interaction. We discuss implications for user involvement to create reconstructions that better translate real-world experience, encourage reflection, incorporate privacy considerations, and preserve shared experiences with XR as a medium for informal intergenerational activities.

 In this article, we propose a conceptual and methodological framework for measuring the impact of the introduction of AI systems in decision settings, based on the concept of technological dominance, i.e. the influence that an AI system can exert on human judgment and decisions. We distinguish between a negative component of dominance (automation bias) and a positive one (algorithm appreciation) by focusing on and systematizing the patterns of interaction between human judgment and AI support, or reliance patterns, and their associated cognitive effects. We then define statistical approaches for measuring these dimensions of dominance, as well as corresponding qualitative visualizations. By reporting about four medical case studies, we illustrate how the proposed methods can be used to inform assessments of dominance and of related cognitive biases in real-world settings. Our study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the effects of introducing AI support into naturalistic and collaborative decision-making.

 Research in HCI has shown a growing interest in unethical design practices across numerous domains, often referred to as “dark patterns”. There is, however, a gap in related literature regarding social networking services (SNSs). In this context, studies emphasise a lack of users’ self-determination regarding control over personal data and time spent on SNSs. We collected over 16 hours of screen recordings from Facebook’s, Instagram’s, TikTok’s, and Twitter’s mobile applications to understand how dark patterns manifest in these SNSs. For this task, we turned towards HCI experts to mitigate possible difficulties of non-expert participants in recognising dark patterns, as prior studies have noticed. Supported by the recordings, two authors of this paper conducted a thematic analysis based on previously described taxonomies, manually classifying the recorded material while delivering two key findings: We observed which instances occur in SNSs and identified two strategies — engaging and governing — with five dark patterns undiscovered before.

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains comes with both high expectations of its benefits and dire predictions of misuse. While AI systems have largely been driven by a technology-centered design approach, the potential societal consequences of AI have mobilized both HCI and AI researchers towards researching human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms ‘human-centered artificial intelligence’ or ‘human-centered machine learning’ or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.

Producers of online peer-production communities (OPPCs) regularly experience conflicts with other producers. A deeper understanding of the producer conflict management approaches employed by community members could help OPPCs improve their conflict management tools. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of conflict management approaches employed by producers. Using OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a case study, we manually annotate OSM mappers’ conflict management approaches from 384 online discussion threads contained in one of OSM’s public communication channels. We investigate the effectiveness of conflict management by verifying whether producer discussions led to a solution. Our results show that online producer conflict management approaches with empathetic and proactive listening behaviors were more likely to reach a productive solution, whereas those approaches with negative online behaviors were less likely to do so. Based on these results, we reflect on how the user interface of OSM’s public online communication channels could better support producers to manage conflict behaviors.

We analyze the composition of WebUI and show that while automatically extracted data is noisy, most examples meet basic criteria for visual UI modeling. We applied several strategies for incorporating semantics found in web pages to increase the performance of visual UI understanding models in the mobile domain, where less labeled data is available: (i) element detection, (ii) screen classification and (iii) screen similarity.

Embodying virtual twins – photorealistic and personalized avatars – will soon be easily achievable in consumer-grade VR. For the first time, we explored how photorealism and personalization impact self-identification, as well as embodiment, avatar perception and presence. Twenty participants were individually scanned and, in a two-hour session, embodied four avatars (high photorealism personalized, low photorealism personalized, high photorealism generic, low photorealism generic). Questionnaire responses revealed stronger mid-immersion body ownership for the high photorealism personalized avatars compared to all other avatar types, and stronger embodiment for high photorealism compared to low photorealism avatars and for personalized compared to generic avatars. In a self-other face distinction task, participants took significantly longer to pause the face morphing videos of high photorealism personalized avatars, suggesting a stronger self-identification bias with these avatars. Photorealism and personalization were perceptually positive features; how employing these avatars in VR applications impacts users over time requires longitudinal investigation.

Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component of AI-driven interactive systems.

However, it is unclear how to design effective XAI experiences for AR. We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses when, what, and how to provide explanations of AI output in AR. The framework was based on a multi-disciplinary literature review of XAI and HCI research, a large-scale survey probing 500+ end-users’ preferences for AR-based explanations, and three workshops with 12 experts collecting their insights about XAI design in AR. XAIR’s utility and effectiveness was verified via a study with 10 designers and another study with 12 end-users. XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.

We discussed users’ perceptions and attributions about AI biases and their desired levels and types of explainability.

 Informed consent is a core cornerstone of ethics in human subject research. Through the informed consent process, participants learn about the study procedure, benefits, risks, and more to make an informed decision. However, recent studies showed that current practices might lead to uninformed decisions and expose participants to unknown risks, especially in online studies. Without the researcher’s presence and guidance, online participants must read a lengthy form on their own with no answers to their questions. In this paper, we examined the role of an AI-powered chatbot in improving informed consent online. By comparing the chatbot with form-based interaction, we found the chatbot improved consent form reading, promoted participants’ feelings of agency, and closed the power gap between the participant and the researcher. Our exploratory analysis further revealed the altered power dynamic might eventually benefit study response quality. We discussed design implications for creating AI-powered chatbots to offer effective informed consent in broader settings.

Significant and rapid advancements in cancer research have been attributed to Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, AI’s role and impact on the clinical side has been limited. This discrepancy manifests due to the overlooked, yet profound, differences in the clinical and research practices in oncology. Our contribution seeks to scrutinize physicians’ engagement with AI by interviewing 7 medical-imaging experts and disentangle its future alignment across the clinical and research workflows, diverging from the existing “one-size-fits-all” paradigm within Human-Centered AI discourses. Our analysis revealed that physicians’ trust in AI is less dependent on their general acceptance of AI, but more on their contestable experiences with AI. Contestability, in clinical workflows, underpins the need for personal supervision of AI outcomes and processes, i.e., clinician-in-the-loop. Finally, we discuss tensions in the desired attributes of AI, such as explainability and control, contextualizing them within the divergent intentionality and scope of clinical and research workflows.

Toucha11y: Making inaccessible public touchscreens accessible,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581254,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581254,"
 Despite their growing popularity, many public kiosks with touchscreens are inaccessible to blind people. Toucha11y is a working prototype that allows blind users to use existing inaccessible touchscreen kiosks independently and with little effort. Toucha11y consists of a mechanical bot that can be instrumented to an arbitrary touchscreen kiosk by a blind user and a companion app on their smartphone. The bot, once attached to a touchscreen, will recognize its content, retrieve the corresponding information from a database, and render it on the user’s smartphone. As a result, a blind person can use the smartphone’s built-in accessibility features to access content and make selections. The mechanical bot will detect and activate the corresponding touchscreen interface. We present the system design of Toucha11y along with a series of technical evaluations. Through a user study, we found out that Toucha11y could help blind users operate inaccessible touchscreen devices.

Misleading beyond visual tricks: How people actually lie with charts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580910,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580910,"
 Data visualizations can empower an audience to make informed decisions. At the same time, deceptive representations of data can lead to inaccurate interpretations while still providing an illusion of data-driven insights. Existing research on misleading visualizations primarily focuses on examples of charts and techniques previously reported to be deceptive. These approaches do not necessarily describe how charts mislead the general population in practice. We instead present an analysis of data visualizations found in a real-world discourse of a significant global event—Twitter posts with visualizations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, violations of visualization design guidelines are not the dominant way people mislead with charts. Specifically, they do not disproportionately lead to reasoning errors in posters’ arguments. Through a series of examples, we present common reasoning errors and discuss how even faithfully plotted data visualizations can be used to support misinformation.

Legal Obligation and Ethical Best Practice: Towards Meaningful Verbal Consent for Voice Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580967,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08091,"
 To improve user experience, Alexa now allows users to consent to data sharing via voice rather than directing them to the companion smartphone app. While verbal consent mechanisms for voice assistants (VAs) can increase usability, they can also undermine principles core to informed consent. We conducted a Delphi study with experts from academia, industry, and the public sector on requirements for verbal consent in VAs. Candidate requirements were drawn from the literature, regulations, and research ethics guidelines that participants rated based on their relevance to the consent process, actionability by platforms, and usability by end-users, discussing their reasoning as the study progressed. We highlight key areas of (dis)agreement between experts, deriving recommendations for regulators, skill developers, and VA platforms towards crafting meaningful verbal consent mechanisms. Key themes include approaching permissions according to the user’s ability to opt-out, minimising consent decisions, and ensuring platforms follow established consent principles.

"Reciprocity, homophily, and social network effects in pictorial communication: A case study of Bitmoji stickers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580990,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01426,"
 Pictorial emojis and stickers are commonly used in online social communications. We analyzed social communications using Bitmoji stickers, which are expressive pictorial stickers made from avatars resembling actual users. We collect a large-scale dataset of 3 billion Bitmoji stickers’ metadata, shared among 300 million Snapchat users. We find that individual Bitmoji sticker usage patterns can be characterized jointly on dimensions of reciprocity and selectivity. Generally speaking, users are either both reciprocal and selective about whom they use Bitmoji stickers with or neither reciprocal nor selective. We additionally demonstrate network homophily by showing that friends use Bitmoji stickers at similar rates. Finally, using a quasi-experimental approach, we show that receiving Bitmoji stickers from a friend encourages future Bitmoji sticker usage and overall Snapchat engagement. Our work carries implications for a better understanding of online pictorial communication behaviors.

Visual Belief Elicitation Reduces the Incidence of False Discovery,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580808,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12512,"
Visualization supports exploratory data analysis (EDA), but EDA frequently presents spurious charts, which can mislead people into drawing unwarranted conclusions. We investigate interventions to prevent false discovery from visualized data. We evaluate whether eliciting analyst beliefs helps guard against the over-interpretation of noisy visualizations. In two experiments, we exposed participants to both spurious and ‘true’ scatterplots, and assessed their ability to infer data-generating models that underlie those samples. Participants who underwent prior belief elicitation made 21% more correct inferences along with 12% fewer false discoveries. This benefit was observed across a variety of sample characteristics, suggesting broad utility to the intervention. However, additional interventions to highlight counterevidence and sample uncertainty did not provide significant advantage. Our findings suggest that lightweight, belief-driven interactions can yield a reliable, if moderate, reduction in false discovery. This work also suggests future directions to improve visual inference and reduce bias.

 With over 1.5 million content creators, OnlyFans is one of the fastest growing subscription-based social media platforms. The platform is primarily associated with sexual content. Thus, OnlyFans creators are uniquely positioned at the intersection of professional social media content creation and sex work. While the motivations of experienced sex workers to adopt OnlyFans have been studied, in this work we seek to understand the motivations of creators who had not previously done sex work. Through a qualitative interview study of 22 U.S.-based OnlyFans creators, we find that beyond the typical motivations for pursuing gig work (e.g., flexibility, autonomy), our participants were motivated by three key factors: (1) societal visibility and mainstream acceptance of OnlyFans; (2) platform design and affordances such as boundary-setting with clients, privacy from the public, and content archives; and (3) the pandemic, as OnlyFans provided an enormous opportunity to overcome lockdown-related issues.

NFTDisk: Visual Detection of Wash Trading in NFT Markets,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581466,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05863,"
 With the growing popularity of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), a new type of digital assets, various fraudulent activities have appeared in NFT markets. Among them, wash trading has become one of the most common frauds in NFT markets, which attempts to mislead investors by creating fake trading volumes. Due to the sophisticated patterns of wash trading, only a subset of them can be detected by automatic algorithms, and manual inspection is usually required. We propose NFTDisk, a novel visualization for investors to identify wash trading activities in NFT markets, where two linked visualization modules are presented: a radial visualization module with a disk metaphor to overview NFT transactions and a flow-based visualization module to reveal detailed NFT flows at multiple levels. We conduct two case studies and an in-depth user interview with 14 NFT investors to evaluate NFTDisk. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in exploring wash trading activities in NFT markets.

Older adults often struggle to locate a function quickly in feature-rich user interfaces (UIs). Mobile UIs not only pack a ton of features in a small screen but also get frequent updates to their visual layouts—thereby exacerbating the problem. This paper explores a design solution where users could search for a UI feature using spoken-word queries. We investigated: 1) what type of questions older users ask when facing interaction challenges in unfamiliar scenarios, 2) how those query types compare with younger users’ inquiries, and 3) how older adults use a voice assistant design probe in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) study. Results reveal five query types when verbally articulating interaction issues: validation, directed and undirected informational, navigational, and conceptual. In the WoZ study, older users typically asked for help following a series of non-unique or off-task feature selections (n = 13/15), and in 77% of those instances, they completed the task in the next interaction.

WESPER: Zero-shot and Realtime Whisper to Normal Voice Conversion for Whisper-based Speech Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580706,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01639,"
 Recognizing whispered speech and converting it to normal speech creates many possibilities for speech interaction. Because the sound pressure of whispered speech is significantly lower than that of normal speech, it can be used as a semi-silent speech interaction in public places without being audible to others. Converting whispers to normal speech also improves the speech quality for people with speech or hearing impairments. However, conventional speech conversion techniques do not provide sufficient conversion quality or require speaker-dependent datasets consisting of pairs of whispered and normal speech utterances. To address these problems, we propose WESPER, a zero-shot, real-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion mechanism based on self-supervised learning. WESPER consists of a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder, which generates hidden speech units common to both whispered and normal speech, and a unit-to-speech (UTS) decoder, which reconstructs speech from the encoded speech units. Unlike the existing methods, this conversion is user-independent and does not require a paired dataset for whispered and normal speech. The UTS decoder can reconstruct speech in any target speaker’s voice from speech units, and it requires only an unlabeled target speaker’s speech data. We confirmed that the quality of the speech converted from a whisper was improved while preserving its natural prosody. Additionally, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach to perform speech reconstruction for people with speech or hearing disabilities.

 Ocean scientists studying diverse organisms and phenomena increasingly rely on imaging devices for their research. These scientists have many tools to collect their data, but few resources for automated analysis. In this paper, we report on discussions with diverse stakeholders to identify community needs and develop a set of functional requirements for the ongoing development of ocean science-specific analysis tools. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with individuals working in the Blue Economy space, revealing four central issues inhibiting the development of effective imaging analysis monitoring tools for marine science. We also identified twelve user archetypes that will engage with these services. Additionally, we held a workshop with 246 participants from 35 countries centered around FathomNet, a web-based open-source annotated image database for marine research. Findings from these discussions are being used to define the feature set and interface design of Ocean Vision AI, a suite of tools and services to advance observational capabilities of life in the ocean.

 Designing for children with ADHD has been of increasing interest to the HCI community. However, current approaches do not adequately involve all relevant stakeholders, and primarily focus on addressing symptoms, following a medical model of disability that is extrinsic to neurodivergent interests. To address this, we employed a multi-step, multi-stakeholder approach (N=31). First, we conducted 1) interviews with children with ADHD and their care ecosystem followed by 2) a co-design pilot with one child with ADHD and his therapists and an interview with a UX designer and an occupational therapist. We then employed 3) co-design sessions with neurotypical children and children with ADHD, and 4) a focus group with their therapists. We identified communication and reflection as key concepts for empowering and promoting the well-being of children with ADHD and their care ecosystem. We contribute design implications for future systems aiming to promote the overall well-being of this population.

 Excessive alcohol consumption causes disability and death. Digital interventions are promising means to promote behavioral change and thus prevent alcohol-related harm, especially in critical moments such as driving. This requires real-time information on a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Here, we develop an in-vehicle machine learning system to predict critical BAC levels. Our system leverages driver monitoring cameras mandated in numerous countries worldwide. We evaluate our system with n = 30 participants in an interventional simulator study. Our system reliably detects driving under any alcohol influence (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.88) and driving above the WHO recommended limit of 0.05 g/dL BAC (AUROC 0.79). Model inspection reveals reliance on pathophysiological effects associated with alcohol consumption. To our knowledge, we are the first to rigorously evaluate the use of driver monitoring cameras for detecting drunk driving. Our results highlight the potential of driver monitoring cameras and enable next-generation drunk driver interaction preventing alcohol-related harm.

The current study is designed to replicate and validate the video game demand scale (VGDS) as a metric for understanding player experiences in video games, while also expanding the application space of that scale to an underrepresented population. Using available materials from prior VGDS research, we created the Video Game Demand Scale-Turkish (VGDS-T). The translated metric was administered online to a volunteer sample of self-identified Turkish-speaking gamers (N = 184), where participants answered questions about perceived cognitive, emotional, exertional, controller, and social demands of their most recent game, as well as other game evaluations (as validation checks). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the translated five-factor scale was a strong fit to the original 26-item scale (VGDS-English) with nominally stronger fit for a 22-item scale (VGDS-Mandarin). Therefore, we both validated the five-factor VGDS on a novel population and provided a translated the metric for researcher and industry use with Turkish-speaking gamers.

 With the most advanced natural language processing and artificial intelligence approaches, effective summarization of long and multi-topic documents—such as academic papers—for readers from different domains still remains a challenge.

ConceptEVA incorporates a custom multi-task longformer encoder decoder to summarize longer documents. Interactive visualizations of document concepts as a network reflecting both semantic relatedness and co-occurrence help users focus on concepts of interest. The user can select these concepts and automatically update the summary to emphasize them. We present two iterations of ConceptEVA evaluated through an expert review and a within-subjects study. We find that participants’ satisfaction with customized summaries through ConceptEVA is higher than their own manually-generated summary, while incorporating critique into the summaries proved challenging. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for designing summarization systems incorporating mixed-initiative interactions.

Furthermore, we collected and analysed brain activity data from our participants during their experience using functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS): preliminary analysis suggests the possibility that this technology may be able to detect the experience of cybersickness. Together, these results can assist the creators of VR experiences, both through mitigation of cybersickness in the design process, and by better understanding the experiences of their users.

 There are myriad ways to analyse a dataset. But which one to trust? In the face of such uncertainty, analysts may adopt multiverse analysis: running all reasonable analyses on the dataset. Yet this is cognitively and technically difficult with existing tools—how does one specify and execute all combinations of reasonable analyses of a dataset?—and often requires discarding existing workflows. We present multiverse, a tool for implementing multiverse analyses in R with expressive syntax supporting existing computational notebook workflows. multiverse supports building up a multiverse through local changes to a single analysis and optimises execution by pruning redundant computations. We evaluate how multiverse supports programming multiverse analyses using (a) principles of cognitive ergonomics to compare with two existing multiverse tools; and (b) case studies based on semi-structured interviews with researchers who have successfully implemented an end-to-end analysis using multiverse. We identify design tradeoffs (e.g. increased flexibility versus learnability), and suggest future directions for multiverse tool design.

 Digital avatars are an important part of identity representation, but there is little work on understanding how to represent disability. We interviewed 18 people with disabilities and related identities about their experiences and preferences in representing their identities with avatars. Participants generally preferred to represent their disability identity if the context felt safe and platforms supported their expression, as it was important for feeling authentically represented. They also utilized avatars in strategic ways: as a means to signal and disclose current abilities, access needs, and to raise awareness. Some participants even found avatars to be a more accessible way to communicate than alternatives. We discuss how avatars can support disability identity representation because of their easily customizable format that is not strictly tied to reality. We conclude with design recommendations for creating platforms that better support people in representing their disability and other minoritized identities.

Authentication ceremonies detect and mitigate Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on end-to-end encrypted messengers, such as Signal, WhatsApp, or Threema. However, prior work found that adoption remains low as non-expert users have difficulties using them correctly. Anecdotal evidence suggests that security researchers also have trouble authenticating others. Since their issues are probably unrelated to user comprehension or usability, the root causes may lie deeper.  This work explores these root causes using autoethnography. The first author kept a five-month research diary of their experience with authentication ceremonies. The results uncover points of failure while planning and conducting authentication ceremonies. They include cognitive load, forgetfulness, social awkwardness, and explanations required by a communication partner. Additionally, this work identifies and discusses how sociocultural aspects affect authentication ceremonies. Lastly, this work discusses a design approach for cooperative security that employs cultural transcoding to improve sociocultural aspects of security by design.

 Children are one of the groups most influenced by COVID-19-related social distancing, and a lack of contact with peers can limit their opportunities to develop social and collaborative skills. However, remote socialization and collaboration as an alternative approach is still a great challenge for children. This paper presents MR.Brick, a Mixed Reality (MR) educational game system that helps children adapt to remote collaboration. A controlled experimental study involving 24 children aged six to ten was conducted to compare MR.Brick with the traditional video game by measuring their social and collaborative skills and analyzing their multi-modal playing behaviours. The results showed that MR.Brick was more conducive to children’s remote collaboration experience than the traditional video game. Given the lack of training systems designed for children to collaborate remotely, this study may inspire interaction design and educational research in related fields.

 Multiverse analysis—a paradigm for statistical analysis that considers all combinations of reasonable analysis choices in parallel—promises to improve transparency and reproducibility. Although recent tools help analysts specify multiverse analyses, they remain difficult to use in practice. In this work, we identify debugging as a key barrier due to the latency from running analyses to detecting bugs and the scale of metadata processing needed to diagnose a bug. To address these challenges, we prototype a command-line interface tool, Multiverse Debugger, which helps diagnose bugs in the multiverse and propagate fixes. In a qualitative lab study (n=13), we use Multiverse Debugger as a probe to develop a model of debugging workflows and identify specific challenges, including difficulty in understanding the multiverse’s composition. We conclude with design implications for future multiverse analysis authoring systems.

Why Combining Text and Visualization Could Improve Bayesian Reasoning: A Cognitive Load Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581218,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581218,"
 Investigations into using visualization to improve Bayesian reasoning and advance risk communication have produced mixed results, suggesting that cognitive ability might affect how users perform with different presentation formats. Our work examines the cognitive load elicited when solving Bayesian problems using icon arrays, text, and a juxtaposition of text and icon arrays. We used a three-pronged approach to capture a nuanced picture of cognitive demand and measure differences in working memory capacity, performance under divided attention using a dual-task paradigm, and subjective ratings of self-reported effort. We found that individuals with low working memory capacity made fewer errors and experienced less subjective workload when the problem contained an icon array compared to text alone, showing that visualization improves accuracy while exerting less cognitive demand.

Tactile Symbols with Continuous and Motion-Coupled Vibration: An Exploration of using Embodied Experiences for Hermeneutic Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581356,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581356,"
With most digital devices, vibrotactile feedback consists of rhythmic patterns of continuous vibration. In contrast, when interacting with physical objects, we experience many of their material properties through vibration which is not continuous, but dynamically coupled to our actions. We assume the first style of vibration to lead to hermeneutic mediation, while the second style leads to embodied mediation. What if both types of mediation could be used to design tactile symbols? To investigate this, five haptic experts designed tactile symbols using continuous and motion-coupled vibration. Experts were interviewed to understand their symbols and design approach. A thematic analysis revealed themes showing that lived experience and affective qualities shaped design choices, that experts optimized for passive or active symbols, and that they considered context as part of the design. Our study suggests that adding embodied experiences as a design resource changes how participants think of tactile symbol design, thus broadening the scope of the symbol by design for context, and expanding their affective repertoire as changing the type of vibration influences perceived valence and arousal.

Conceptualizing Algorithmic Stigmatization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580970,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580970,"
Algorithmic systems have infiltrated many aspects of our society, mundane to high-stakes, and can lead to algorithmic harms known as representational and allocative. In this paper, we consider what stigma theory illuminates about mechanisms leading to algorithmic harms in algorithmic assemblages. We apply the four stigma elements (i.e., labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss/discrimination) outlined in sociological stigma theories to algorithmic assemblages in two contexts : 1) ""risk prediction"" algorithms in higher education, and 2) suicidal expression and ideation detection on social media. We contribute the novel theoretical conceptualization of algorithmic stigmatization as a sociotechnical mechanism that leads to a unique kind of algorithmic harm: algorithmic stigma. Theorizing algorithmic stigmatization aids in identifying theoretically-driven points of intervention to mitigate and/or repair algorithmic stigma. While prior theorizations reveal how stigma governs socially and spatially, this work illustrates how stigma governs sociotechnically.

PopBlends: Strategies for conceptual blending with large language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580948,3,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04920,"
 Pop culture is an important aspect of communication. On social media people often post pop culture reference images that connect an event, product or other entity to a pop culture domain. Creating these images is a creative challenge that requires finding a conceptual connection between the users’ topic and a pop culture domain. In cognitive theory, this task is called conceptual blending. We present a system called PopBlends that automatically suggests conceptual blends. The system explores three approaches that involve both traditional knowledge extraction methods and large language models. Our annotation study shows that all three methods provide connections with similar accuracy, but with very different characteristics. Our user study shows that people found twice as many blend suggestions as they did without the system, and with half the mental demand. We discuss the advantages of combining large language models with knowledge bases for supporting divergent and convergent thinking.

Haptic-Captioning: Using Audio-Haptic Interfaces to Enhance Speaker Indication in Real-Time Captions for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Viewers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581076,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roshan-Peiris-2/publication/369377376_Haptic-Captioning_Using_Audio-Haptic_Interfaces_to_Enhance_Speaker_Indication_in_Real_Time_Captions_for_Deaf_and_Hard-of-Hearing_Viewers/links/6418985e92cfd54f841682ce/Haptic-Captioning-Using-Audio-Haptic-Interfaces-to-Enhance-Speaker-Indication-in-Real-Time-Captions-for-Deaf-and-Hard-of-Hearing-Viewers.pdf,"
Captions make the audio content of videos accessible and understandable for deaf or hard-of-hearing people (DHH). However, in real-time captioning scenarios, captions alone can be challenging for DHH users to identify the active speaker in a real time in multiple-speaker scenarios. To enhance the accessibility of real-time captioning, we propose Haptic-Captioning which provides real-time vibration feedback on the wrist by directly translating the sound of content into vibrations. We conducted three experiments to examine: (1) the haptic perception (Preliminary Study), (2) the feasibility of the haptic modality along with real-time and non-real-time visual captioning methods (Study 1), and (3) the user experience of using the Haptic-Captioning system in different media contexts (Study 2). Our results highlight that the Haptic-Captioning complements visual captions by improving caption readability, maintaining media engagement, enhancing understanding of emotions, and assisting speaker indication in real-time captioning scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss design implications for the future development of Haptic-Captioning.

Investigating Wrist Deflection Scrolling Techniques for Extended Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580870,0,,"
 Scrolling in extended reality (XR) is currently performed using handheld controllers or vision-based arm-in-front gestures, which have the limitations of encumbering the user’s hands or requiring a specific arm posture, respectively. To address these limitations, we investigate freehand, posture-independent scrolling driven by wrist deflection. We propose two novel techniques: Wrist Joystick, which uses rate control, and Wrist Drag, which uses position control. In an empirical study of a rapid item acquisition task and a casual browsing task, both Wrist Drag and Wrist Joystick performed on par with a comparable state-of-the-art technique on one of the two tasks. Further, using a relaxed arm-at-side posture, participants retained their arm-in-front performance for both wrist techniques. Finally, we analyze behavioral and ergonomic data to provide design insights for wrist deflection scrolling. Our results demonstrate that wrist deflection provides a promising method for performant scrolling controls while offering additional benefits over existing XR interaction techniques.

Exploration of Bare-Hand Mid-Air Pointing Selection Techniques for Dense Virtual Reality Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585615,3,,"
 Target selection in dense virtual reality (VR) environments is challenging. Prior work has explored different controller-based raycasting techniques to assist target selection in such environments. However, limited research has focused on selection via mid-air barehand, which represents another major input metaphor for immersive environments. In this paper, we first review the existing raycasting selection techniques for dense VR environments. Based on this, we propose and develop two freehand pointing selection techniques—HandDepthCursor and HandConeGrid, and implement MultiFingerBubble, a recently-proposed technique. We then conduct a user study to compare and evaluate their performance and experience in a target selection task in dense VR environments. Our results suggest that HandDepthCursor and HandConeGrid led to significantly faster and more accurate selection performance, and lower perceived workload and arm fatigue. In addition, HandConeGrid showed a distinct advantage in high-density environments.

 Homelessness presents a long-standing problem worldwide. Like other welfare services, homeless services have gained increased traction in Machine Learning (ML) research. Unhoused persons are vulnerable and using their data in the ML pipeline raises serious concerns about the unintended harms and consequences of prioritizing different ML values. To address this, we conducted a critical analysis of 40 research papers identified through a systematic literature review in ML homelessness service provision research. We found that the values of novelty, performance, and identifying limitations were uplifted in these papers, whereas (in)efficiency, (low/high) cost, fast, (violated) privacy, and (homeless condition) reproducibility valuescollapse. Consequently, unhoused persons were lost (i.e., humans were deprioritized) at multi-level ML abstraction of predictors, categories, and algorithms. Our findings illuminate potential pathways forward at the intersection of data science, HCI and STS by situating humans at the center to support this vulnerable community.

Overcoming Algorithm Aversion: A Comparison between Process and Outcome Control,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581253,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581253,"
 Algorithm aversion occurs when humans are reluctant to use algorithms despite their superior performance. Studies show that giving users outcome control by providing agency over how models’ predictions are incorporated into decision-making mitigates algorithm aversion. We study whether algorithm aversion is mitigated by process control, wherein users can decide what input factors and algorithms to use in model training. We conduct a replication study of outcome control, and test novel process control study conditions on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Prolific. Our results partly confirm prior findings on the mitigating effects of outcome control, while also forefronting reproducibility challenges. We find that process control in the form of choosing the training algorithm mitigates algorithm aversion, but changing inputs does not. Furthermore, giving users both outcome and process control does not reduce algorithm aversion more than outcome or process control alone. This study contributes to design considerations around mitigating algorithm aversion.

Understanding Dark Patterns in Home IoT Devices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581432,0,,"
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are ubiquitous, but little attention has been paid to how they may incorporate dark patterns despite consumer protections and privacy concerns arising from their unique access to intimate spaces and always-on capabilities. This paper conducts a systematic investigation of dark patterns in 57 popular, diverse smart home devices. We update manual interaction and annotation methods for the IoT context, then analyze dark pattern frequency across device types, manufacturers, and interaction modalities. We find that dark patterns are pervasive in IoT experiences, but manifest in diverse ways across device traits. Speakers, doorbells, and camera devices contain the most dark patterns, with manufacturers of such devices (Amazon and Google) having the most dark patterns compared to other vendors. We investigate how this distribution impacts the potential for consumer exposure to dark patterns, discuss broader implications for key stakeholders like designers and regulators, and identify opportunities for future dark patterns study.

 Mental health discussions on public forums influence the perceptions of people. Negative consequences may result from hostile and “othering” portrayals of people with mental disorders. Adopting the lens of Moral Foundation Theory (MFT), we study framings of mental health discourse on Twitter and News, and how moral underpinnings abate or exacerbate stigma. We adopted a large language model based representation framework to score 13,277,115 public tweets and 21,167 news articles against MFT’s five foundations. We found discussions on Twitter to demonstrate compassion, justice and equity-centered moral values for those suffering from mental illness, in contrast to those on News. That said, stigmatized discussions appeared on both Twitter and News, with news articles being more stigmatizing than tweets. We discuss implications for public health authorities to refine measures for safe reporting of mental health, and for social media platforms to design affordances that enable empathetic discourse.

Improving multiparty interactions with a robot using large language models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585602,2,,"
 Speaker diarization is a key component of systems that support multiparty interactions of co-located users, such as meeting facilitation robots. The goal is to identify who spoke what, often to provide feedback, moderate participation, and personalize responses by the robot. Current systems use a combination of acoustic (e.g. pitch differences) and visual features (e.g. gaze) to perform diarization, but involve the use of additional sensors or require overhead signal processing efforts. Alternatively, automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a necessary step in the diarization pipeline, and utilizing the transcribed text to directly identify speaker labels in the conversation can eliminate such challenges. With that motivation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify speaker labels from transcribed text and observe an exact match of 77% and a word level accuracy of 90%. We discuss our findings and the potential use of LLMs as a diarization tool for future systems.

In many creator economy platforms, algorithms significantly impact creators’ practices and decisions about their creative expression and monetization. Emerging research suggests that the opacity of the algorithm and platform policies often distract creators from their creative endeavors. To study how algorithmic platforms can be more ‘creator-friendly,’ we conducted a mixed-methods study: interviews (N=14) and a participatory design workshop (N=12) with YouTube creators. Through the interviews, we found how creators’ folk theories of the curation algorithm impact their work strategies — whether they choose to work with or against the algorithm — and the associated challenges in the process. In the workshop, creators explored solution ideas to overcome the aforementioned challenges, such as fostering diverse and creative expressions, achieving success as a creator, and motivating creators to continue their job. Based on these findings, we discuss design opportunities for how algorithmic platforms can support and motivate creators to sustain their creative work.

Activism efforts have played a central role in advancing the rights of disabled people in the United States. Social media offers new opportunities for people with disabilities to engage in activism while bypassing the accessibility issues involved in traditional activism. At the same time, disabled people face various forms of social and technical exclusion that may also complicate their use of social media for disability activism. To understand how disabled activists advocate for social change online, we interviewed 20 disabled content creators about their goals, strategies, and challenges around posting activism content on social media. We find that visibility is essential for successful online activism, but that the pursuit of visibility requires disabled content creators to navigate additional challenges including social stigma, algorithmic suppression, accessibility issues, and a heightened risk of harassment. We identify three main types of disability-related harassment faced by disabled activists, along with six ways in which they respond to such harassment. We examine the sociotechnical nature of the strategies disabled activists use to gain visibility, and identify key trade-offs involved in mitigating harassment while engaging in activism on social media.

 Over the last few years, we have seen many approaches using tangibles to address the limited expressiveness of touchscreens. Mainstream tangible detection uses fiducial markers embedded in the tangibles. However, the coarse sensor size of capacitive touchscreens makes tangibles bulky, limiting their usefulness. We propose a novel deep-learning super-resolution network to facilitate fiducial tangibles on capacitive touchscreens better. In detail, our network super-resolves the markers enabling off-the-shelf detection algorithms to track tangibles reliably. Our network generalizes to unseen marker sets, such as AprilTag, ArUco, and ARToolKit. Therefore, we are not limited to a fixed number of distinguishable objects and do not require data collection and network training for new fiducial markers. With extensive evaluation, including real-world users and five showcases, we demonstrate the applicability of our open-source approach on commodity mobile devices and further highlight the potential of tangibles on capacitive touchscreens.

AI explanations have been increasingly used to help people better utilize AI recommendations in AI-assisted decision making. While AI explanations may change over time due to updates of the AI model, little is known about how these changes may affect people’s perceptions and usage of the model. In this paper, we study how varying levels of similarity between the AI explanations before and after a model update affects people’s trust in and satisfaction with the AI model. We conduct randomized human-subject experiments on two decision making contexts where people have different levels of domain knowledge. Our results show that changes in AI explanation during the model update do not affect people’s tendency to adopt AI recommendations. However, they may change people’s subjective trust in and satisfaction with the AI model via changing both their perceived model accuracy and perceived consistency of AI explanations with their prior knowledge.

 While people’s perceptions of targeted ads have been studied extensively from a Western perspective (e.g., North America, Europe), we know little about users’ perceptions in the South Asian region. We interviewed 40 participants from two South Asian countries, Bangladesh and India, to explore their perceptions and practices regarding targeted ads on social media platforms. Participants identified emerging ad types, such as influencer-based ads and soft ads, through articles. In addition, participants often outweighed discounts over product quality when viewing ads. We also observed novel user mental models of targeted ads based on mobile app permissions and excessive AI usage. Participants often preferred ad control over transparency. While most participants rarely used ad settings, some controlled ads by changing mobile app permissions or muting ads on social media platforms. Participants also raised concerns about fraudulent targeted ads and privacy violations due to device sharing. We present potential design ideas to mitigate these concerns.

Subjective Probability Correction for Uncertainty Representations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580998,0,https://osf.io/z6fcw/download,"
We propose a new approach to uncertainty communication: we keep the uncertainty representation fixed, but adjust the distribution displayed to compensate for biases in people’s subjective probability in decision-making. To do so, we adopt a linear-in-probit model of subjective probability and derive two corrections to a Normal distribution based on the model’s intercept and slope: one correcting all right-tailed probabilities, and the other preserving the mode and one focal probability. We then conduct two experiments on U.S. demographically-representative samples. We show participants hypothetical U.S. Senate election forecasts as text or a histogram and elicit their subjective probabilities using a betting task. The first experiment estimates the linear-in-probit intercepts and slopes, and confirms the biases in participants’ subjective probabilities. The second, preregistered follow-up shows participants the bias-corrected forecast distributions. We find the corrections substantially improve participants’ decision quality by reducing the integrated absolute error of their subjective probabilities compared to the true probabilities. These corrections can be generalized to any univariate probability or confidence distribution, giving them broad applicability. Our preprint, code, data, and preregistration are available at https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/kcwxm

 Personalized recommender systems suffuse modern life, shaping what media we read and what products we consume. Algorithms powering such systems tend to consist of supervised-learning-based heuristics, such as latent factor models with a variety of heuristically chosen prediction targets. Meanwhile, theoretical treatments of recommendation frequently address the decision-theoretic nature of the problem, including the need to balance exploration and exploitation, via the multi-armed bandits (MABs) framework. However, MAB-based approaches rely heavily on assumptions about human preferences. These preference assumptions are seldom tested using human subject studies, partly due to the lack of publicly available toolkits to conduct such studies. In this work, we conduct a study with crowdworkers in a comics recommendation MABs setting. Each arm represents a comic category, and users provide feedback after each recommendation. We check the validity of core MABs assumptions—that human preferences (reward distributions) are fixed over time—and find that they do not hold. This finding suggests that any MAB algorithm used for recommender systems should account for human preference dynamics. While answering these questions, we provide a flexible experimental framework for understanding human preference dynamics and testing MABs algorithms with human users. The code for our experimental framework and the collected data can be found at https://github.com/HumainLab/human-bandit-evaluation.

 Trust is crucial for human interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) and is frequently measured through questionnaires or rating scales. One commonly used questionnaire in AI research is the Trust between People and Automation scale (TPA). However, its psychometric quality has yet to be examined in the context of AI. More recently, a Trust Scale for Explainable AI (TXAI) was recommended but not empirically evaluated. In this study, we assessed the psychometric qualities of both scales, using confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses to test the scales’ validity and coefficients α and ω for reliability estimation. Our results suggested good psychometric quality for the TXAI after removing one item. Concerning the TPA, acceptable quality was only achieved when using a two-factor model (trust and distrust) and after removing two items. We provide recommendations for using the two scales and evidence to distinguish trust and distrust as separate psychological constructs.

 To promote data transparency, frameworks such as CrowdWorkSheets encourage documentation of annotation practices on the interfaces of AI systems, but we do not know how they affect user experience. Will the quality of labeling affect perceived credibility of training data? Does the source of annotation matter? Will a credible dataset persuade users to trust a system even if it shows racial biases in its predictions? To find out, we conducted a user study (N = 430) with a prototype of a classification system, using a 2 (labeling quality: high vs. low) × 4 (source: others-as-source vs. self-as-source cue vs. self-as-source voluntary action, vs. self-as-source forced action) × 3 (AI performance: none vs. biased vs. unbiased) experiment. We found that high-quality labeling leads to higher perceived training data credibility, which in turn enhances users’ trust in AI, but not when the system shows bias. Practical implications for explainable and ethical AI interfaces are discussed.

 Recommender systems (RS) have become increasingly vital for guiding health actions. While traditional systems filter content based on either demographics, personal history of activities, or preferences of other users, newer systems use social media information to personalize recommendations, based either on the users’ own activities and/or those of their friends on social media platforms. However, we do not know if these approaches differ in their persuasiveness. To find out, we conducted a user study of a fitness plan recommender system (N = 341), wherein participants were randomly assigned to one of six personalization approaches, with half of them given a choice to switch to a different approach. Data revealed that social media-based personalization threatens users’ identity and increases privacy concerns. Users prefer personalized health recommendations based on their own preferences. Choice enhances trust by providing users with a greater sense of agency and lowering their privacy concerns. These findings provide design implications for RS, especially in the preventive health domain.

Our results highlight that compared to individuals, groups rely on AI models more regardless of their correctness, but they are more confident when they overturn incorrect AI recommendations. We also find that groups make fairer decisions than individuals according to the accuracy equality criterion, and groups are willing to give AI more credit when they make correct decisions.

 Enabling students to dynamically transition between individual and collaborative learning activities has great potential to support better learning. We explore how technology can support teachers in orchestrating dynamic transitions during class. Working with five teachers and 199 students over 22 class sessions, we conducted classroom-based prototyping of a co-orchestration technology ecosystem that supports the dynamic pairing of students working with intelligent tutoring systems. Using mixed-methods data analysis, we study the resulting observed classroom dynamics, and how teachers and students perceived and experienced dynamic transitions as supported by our technology. We discover a potential tension between teachers’ and students’ preferred level of control: students prefer a degree of control over the dynamic transitions that teachers are hesitant to grant. Our study reveals design implications and challenges for future human-AI co-orchestration in classroom use, bringing us closer to realizing the vision of highly-personalized smart classrooms that address the unique needs of each student.

Through an analysis of 2016–2021 CHI proceedings and a survey with 15 authors who published in these proceedings, we found that reporting race and ethnicity of participants is very rare (<3%) and that researchers are far from consensus. Drawing from multidisciplinary literature and our findings, we devise considerations for HCI researchers to decide why, when, and from whom to collect race and ethnicity data. For truly inclusive, equitable technologies, we encourage deliberate decisions rather than default omissions.

Reality Rifts: Wonder-ful Interfaces by Disrupting Perceptual Causality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581454,0,https://www.yihaopeng.tw/pdf/CHI23_Reality_Rifts.pdf,"
Reality Rifts are interfaces between the physical and the virtual reality, where incoherent observations of physical behavior lead users to imagine comprehensive and plausible end-to-end dynamics. Reality Rifts emerge in interactive physical systems that lack one or more components that are central to their operation, yet where the physical end-to-end interaction persists with plausible outcomes. Even in the presence of a Reality Rift, users can still interact with a system—much like they would with the unaltered and complete counterpart—leading them to implicitly infer the existence and imagine the behavior of the lacking components from observable phenomena and outcomes. Therefore, dynamic systems with Reality Rifts trigger doubt, curiosity, and rumination—a sense of wonder that users experience when observing a Reality Rift due to their innate curiosity.  In this paper, we explore how interactive systems can elicit and guide the user’s imagination by integrating Reality Rifts. We outline the design process for opening a Reality Rift in interactive physical systems, describe the resulting design space, and explore it through six characteristic prototypes. To understand to what extent and with which qualities these prototypes indeed induce a sense of wonder during an interaction, we evaluated Reality Rifts in the form of a field deployment with 50 participants. We discuss participants’ behavior and derive factors for the implementation of future wonder-ful experiences.

Cyborg Assemblages: How autistic adults construct sociotechnical networks to support cognitive function,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581556,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581556,"
Autism has become a popular context for accessible technology researchers, yet a majority of HCI projects for autism and ADHD do not engage in participatory methods or otherwise involve disabled stakeholders in the project and research design. Prior inquiry has identified executive function as a common difficulty for which technologies may provide novel benefits. In this study, we explore how autistic adults currently use technologies, broadly defined, to augment executive function and support themselves in day-to-day tasks. We collect qualitative data from narratives elicited during informal asynchronous interviews to conduct a digital ethnomethodology. Following from principles of Design Justice, crip technoscience, and cyborg assemblage theory, we investigate how autistic adults articulate their own sociotechnical environments into technologically mediated assemblages of executive function and interpersonal webs of care. These patterns of sociotechnical formation inform future work in research and design for tools that can mediate executive function for all users.

Humorous Robotic Behavior as a New Approach to Mitigating Social Awkwardness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580821,1,,"
Social awkwardness is a frequent challenge to healthy social interactions and can dramatically impact how people feel, communicate and behave. It is known that humor can invoke positive feelings and enable people to modify perspective of a situation. We explored whether using a non-humanoid robotic object performing humorous behavior can reduce social awkwardness between two strangers. The robot was peripherally incorporated into the interaction to ensure the natural social flow. We compared the impact of humorous and non-humorous robotic gestures on the human-human interaction. Objective and subjective measures indicate that despite being peripheral to the human-human interaction, the humorous robotic gestures significantly reduced the intensity of awkwardness between the strangers. Our findings suggest humorous robotic behavior can be used to enhance interpersonal relationships hindered by awkwardness and still preserve natural human-human interaction.

In recent years, extended reality (XR) technology has seen a rise in use in environmental subjects, i.e., climate change or biodiversity loss, as a potential tool to inform and engage the public with current and future environmental issues. However, research on the potential of XR technology for environmental sustainability is still in the early stages, and there is no clear synthesis of the methods studied in this field. To provide a clearer view of existing approaches and research objectives, we systematically reviewed current literature dealing with XR use in environmental topics. Although the results indicate that the volume of literature exploring XR in environmental applications is increasing, empirical evidence of its impact is limited, hindering the possibility of presently drawing significant conclusions on its potential benefits. Based on our analyses, we identified thematic, theoretical, and methodological knowledge gaps and provide a guideline to aid future research in the field.

Building Community Capacity: Exploring Voice Assistants to Support Older Adults in an Independent Living Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581561,1,,"
Voice assistants (VAs) such as Siri or Amazon Alexa can benefit older adults by offering accessible and convenient information options and aiding living independently. Therefore, researchers have considered how VAs might support older adults. Yet, few studies have explored opportunities for VAs to support communities and the implications of this integration. This study investigates older adults' perceptions of VAs and the potential to extend VA capabilities to support an independent living community. We invited independent living residents to virtual community forums and interviews to discuss their experiences with VAs, expectations, and concerns for VA integration to support information exchange, wellness, and social connections in their community. We found that residents desired additional VA capabilities to address unique community needs, including building on existing community capacities to support VA adoption and use. We discuss VA design implications for independent living communities and recommendations to support VA sustainability in a community environment.

 Collaborative Mixed Reality (MR) systems that help extend expertise for physical tasks to remote environments often situate experts in an immersive view of the task environment to bring the collaboration closer to collocated settings. In this paper, we design UnMapped, an alternative interface for remote experts that combines a live 3D view of the active space within the novice’s environment with a static 3D recreation of the expert’s own workspace to leverage their existing spatial memories within it. We evaluate the impact of this approach on single and repeated use of collaborative MR systems for remote guidance through a comparative study. Our results indicate that despite having a limited understanding of the novice’s environment, using an UnMapped interface increased performance and communication efficiency while reducing experts’ task load. We also outline the various affordances of providing remote experts with a familiar and spatially-stable environment to assist novices.

 Trauma is a common experience affecting over 70 percent of adults globally, with many survivors seeking support from online communities. Yet few studies explore the online experiences of muted groups who lack the words to name or describe their trauma. We pull from 29 in-depth interviews with muted trauma survivors who belong to online communities where trauma narratives are commonplace. Using a spinning top metaphor, we model the sociotechnical nature of the disclosure decision-making process, uncovering new affordances, such as indirect feedback and transportability in online platforms. Findings challenge prior notions of community engagement and algorithmic filter bubbles, highlighting the potential for algorithmic filters to counteract societal filters for muted groups. We conclude with design recommendations to make online spaces safer for trauma survivors.

The Hidden Rules of Hanabi: How Humans Outperform AI Agents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581550,0,,"
 Games that feature multiple players, limited communication, and partial information are particularly challenging for AI agents. In the cooperative card game Hanabi, which possesses all of these attributes, AI agents fail to achieve scores comparable to even first-time human players. Through an observational study of three mixed-skill Hanabi play groups, we identify the techniques used by humans that help to explain their superior performance compared to AI. These concern physical artefact manipulation, coordination play, role establishment, and continual rule negotiation. Our findings extend previous accounts of human performance in Hanabi, which are purely in terms of theory-of-mind reasoning, by revealing more precisely how this form of collective decision-making is enacted in skilled human play. Our interpretation points to a gap in the current capabilities of AI agents to perform cooperative tasks.

We present EchoSpeech, a minimally-obtrusive silent speech interface (SSI) powered by low-power active acoustic sensing. EchoSpeech uses speakers and microphones mounted on a glass-frame and emits inaudible sound waves towards the skin. By analyzing echos from multiple paths, EchoSpeech captures subtle skin deformations caused by silent utterances and uses them to infer silent speech. With a user study of 12 participants, we demonstrate that EchoSpeech can recognize 31 isolated commands and 3-6 figure connected digits with 4.5% (std 3.5%) and 6.1% (std 4.2%) Word Error Rate (WER), respectively. We further evaluated EchoSpeech under scenarios including walking and noise injection to test its robustness. We then demonstrated using EchoSpeech in demo applications in real-time operating at 73.3mW, where the real-time pipeline was implemented on a smartphone with only 1-6 minutes of training data. We believe that EchoSpeech takes a solid step towards minimally-obtrusive wearable SSI for real-life deployment.

We also designed a voice-based application that provides aides with guidance for day-to-day tasks and for performing a medical assessment. Via a lab-based study with 25 aides and seven patients, we explore how tailoring the IVAs’ design to home health care might impact its acceptability as a work device, enabling cooperative work among aides and clients, while potentially causing conflict that will require IVA designers to decide whose values to prioritize. We also highlight limits in aides’ power to control IVAs in clients’ homes. Finally, we discuss implications for designing privacy-preserving IVAs, including leveraging IVAs’ physical design to enact privacy mechanisms and opportunities to build ‘always on’ IVAs for privacy-sensitive contexts like home health care.

Object manipulation in 3D space, meaning translating, rotating, and scaling, is ubiquitous in virtual reality (VR), and several interaction techniques have been developed in the past to optimize the task performance and usability. However, preliminary research indicates that individual spatial abilities also have an impact. Yet, it was never investigated if users’ spatial abilities influence VR object manipulation. We assessed this in a user study (N=66) using 21 manipulation tasks defined in a Fitts’ law-related approach. As interaction techniques, we chose gizmos for simultaneously manipulating 1 and 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) and a handle bar metaphor for 7 DOF. Higher spatial abilities resulted in significantly shorter task completion time and more targeted manipulations, while task accuracy was unaffected. However, an optimized interaction technique could compensate individual disadvantages. We propose seven guidelines on spatial abilities in interaction technique design and research to personalize and improve VR applications.

This work aims to explore how human assessments and AI predictions can be combined to identify misinformation on social media. To do so, we design a personalized AI which iteratively takes as training data a single user’s assessment of content and predicts how the same user would assess other content. We conduct a user study in which participants interact with a personalized AI that learns their assessments of a feed of tweets, shows its predictions of whether a user would find other tweets (in)accurate, and evolves according to the user feedback. We study how users perceive such an AI, and whether the AI predictions influence users’ judgment. We find that this influence does exist and it grows larger over time, but it is reduced when users provide reasoning for their assessment. We draw from our empirical observations to identify design implications and directions for future work.

 Increased use of technology in schools raises new privacy and security challenges for K-12 students—and harms such as commercialization of student data, exposure of student data in security breaches, and expanded tracking of students—but the extent of these challenges is unclear. In this paper, first, we interviewed 18 school officials and IT personnel to understand what educational technologies districts use and how they manage student privacy and security around these technologies. Second, to determine if these educational technologies are frequently endorsed across United States (US) public schools, we compiled a list of linked educational technology websites scraped from 15,573 K-12 public school/district domains and analyzed them for privacy risks. Our findings suggest that administrators lack resources to properly assess privacy and security issues around educational technologies even though they do pose potential privacy issues. Based on these findings, we make recommendations for policymakers, educators, and the CHI research community.

The use of smartphones has become an integral part of everyone's lives. Due to the ubiquitous nature and multiple functionalities of smartphones, the data handled by these devices are sensitive in nature. Despite the measures companies take to protect users’ data, research has shown that people do not take the necessary actions to stay safe from security and privacy threats. Persuasive games have been implemented across various domains to motivate people towards a positive behaviour change. Even though persuasive games could be effective, research has shown that the one-size-fits-all approach to designing persuasive games might not be as effective as the tailored versions of the game. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a persuasive game to improve user awareness about smartphone security and privacy tailored to the user's motivational orientation using Regulatory Focus Theory. From the results of our mixed-methods in-the-wild study of 102 people followed by a one-on-one interview of 25 people, it is evident that the tailored version of the persuasive game performed better than the non-tailored version of the game towards improving users’ secure smartphone behaviour. We contribute to the broader HCI community by offering design suggestions and the benefits of tailoring persuasive games.

Social and cultural taboos frequently prevent meaningful conversation around gendered health and wellbeing, across the globe and to varying degrees.

We observed participant activity for two weeks, before conducting in-depth interviews with 10 participants to better understand their experiences of engaging within the WhatsApp group. We use the lens of Legitimate Peripheral Participation to examine how peripheral and core members of the community drew on new audiences and support systems as they questioned existing structures upholding taboos. We discuss scaffolding mechanisms that could enhance learning about taboo topics in online safe spaces, and the tensions of anonymity in such learning spaces.

Research in HCI applied to clinical interventions relies on normative assumptions about which bodies and minds are healthy, valuable, and desirable. To disrupt this normalizing drive in HCI, we define a “counterventional approach” to intervention technology design informed by critical scholarship and community perspectives. This approach is meant to unsettle normative assumptions of intervention as urgent, necessary, and curative. We begin with a historical overview of intervention in HCI and its critics. Then, through reparative readings of past HCI projects in autism intervention, we illustrate the emergent principles of a counterventional approach and how it may manifest research outcomes that are fundamentally divergent from dominant approaches. We then explicate characteristics of “counterventions” – projects that aim to contest dominant sociotechnical paradigms through privileging community and participants in research inquiry, interaction design, and analysis of outcomes. These divergent research imaginaries have transformative implications for how interventionist HCI might be conducted in future.

DeepSeer: Interactive RNN Explanation and Debugging via State Abstraction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580852,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01576,"
 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks given its superior performance on processing sequential data. However, it is challenging to interpret and debug RNNs due to the inherent complexity and the lack of transparency of RNNs. While many explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed for RNNs, most of them only support local explanations rather than global explanations. In this paper, we present DeepSeer, an interactive system that provides both global and local explanations of RNN behavior in multiple tightly-coordinated views for model understanding and debugging. The core of DeepSeer is a state abstraction method that bundles semantically similar hidden states in an RNN model and abstracts the model as a finite state machine. Users can explore the global model behavior by inspecting text patterns associated with each state and the transitions between states. Users can also dive into individual predictions by inspecting the state trace and intermediate prediction results of a given input. A between-subjects user study with 28 participants shows that, compared with a popular XAI technique, LIME, participants using DeepSeer made a deeper and more comprehensive assessment of RNN model behavior, identified the root causes of incorrect predictions more accurately, and came up with more actionable plans to improve the model performance.

Multiplayer online games seek to address toxic behaviors such as trolling and griefing through behavior moderation, where penalties such as chat restriction or account suspension are issued against toxic players in the hope that punishments create a teachable moment for punished players to reflect and improve future behavior. While punishments impact player experience (PX) in profound ways, little is known regarding how players experience behavior moderation. In this study, we conducted a survey of 291 players to understand their experiences with punishments in online multiplayer games. Through several statistical analyses, we found that moderation explanation plays a critical role in improving players’ perceived transparency and fairness of moderation; and these perceptions significantly affect what players do after punishments. We discuss moderation experience as an important facet of PX, bridge the game and moderation literature, and provide design implications for behavior moderation in multiplayer online games.

It is crucial to make software, with its ever-growing influence on everyday lives, accessible to all, including people with disabilities. Despite promoting software accessibility through government regulations, development guidelines, tools and frameworks, investigations reveal a marketplace of inaccessible web and mobile applications. To better understand the limitations of contemporary software industry in adopting accessibility practices, it is necessary to construct a holistic view that combines the perspectives of software practitioners, stakeholders and end users. In this paper, we collect 637 conversations from Twitter to synthesize and qualitatively analyze discussions posted about software accessibility. Our findings observe an active community that provides feedback on inaccessible software, shares personal accounts of development practices and advocates for inclusivity. By perceiving software accessibility from process, profession and people viewpoints, we present current conventions, challenges and possible resolutions with four emergent themes: cost and incentives, awareness and advocacy, technology and resources, and integration and inclusion.

We ask how historic redlining, a US government run, racially discriminatory practice of assessing and mapping property values for federally subsidized home loan eligibility in the 1930s, is tied to current issues of sustainability. We frame redlining as a historic data practice, tied to ongoing exposure to environmental harms and difficulty building generational wealth in African American communities in Indianapolis. To address this, we made maps to ground interdisciplinary discourse between the authors: two who research sustainable human computer interaction (SHCI) and one who researches sustainable food systems, including issues of food security. Our maps, which combine historical redlining maps and contemporary sustainability issues facing Indianapolis, helped us explore the ongoing impacts of redlining across our disciplines. We develop the term ‘sustainability’ for HCI across racial, socioeconomic, and environmental tensions and reflect on how SHCI's emerging posthuman emphasis on human/non-human relations are associated with human/human challenges like redlining.

 Modern news aggregators do the hard work of organizing a large news stream, creating collections for a given news story with tens of source options. This paper shows that navigating large source collections for a news story can be challenging without further guidance. In this work, we design three interfaces – the Annotated Article, the Recomposed Article, and the Question Grid – aimed at accompanying news readers in discovering coverage diversity while they read. A first usability study with 10 journalism experts confirms the designed interfaces all reveal coverage diversity and determine each interface’s potential use cases and audiences. In a second usability study, we developed and implemented a reading exercise with 95 novice news readers to measure exposure to coverage diversity. Results show that Annotated Article users are able to answer questions 34% more completely than with two existing interfaces while finding the interface equally easy to use.

 The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications has generated interest from many industries and a need for graduates with relevant knowledge. An IoT system is comprised of spatially distributed interactions between humans and various interconnected IoT components. These interactions are contextualized within their ambient environment, thus impeding educators from recreating authentic tasks for hands-on IoT learning. We propose LearnIoTVR, an end-to-end virtual reality (VR) learning environment which helps students to acquire IoT knowledge through immersive design, programming, and exploration of real-world environments empowered by IoT (e.g., a smart house). The students start the learning process by installing virtual IoT components we created in different locations inside the VR environment so that the learning will be situated in the same context where the IoT is applied. With our custom-designed 3D block-based language, students can program IoT behaviors directly within VR and get immediate feedback on their programming outcome. In the user study, we evaluated the learning outcomes among students using LearnIoTVR with a pre- and post-test to understand to what extent does engagement in LearnIoTVR lead to gains in learning programming skills and IoT competencies. Additionally, we examined what aspects of LearnIoTVR support usability and learning of programming skills compared to a traditional desktop-based learning environment. The results from these studies were promising. We also acquired insightful user feedback which provides inspiration for further expansions of this system.

New immersive 3D design tools enable the creation of spatial design recordings, capturing collaborative design activities. By reviewing captured spatial design sessions, which include user activities, workflows, and tool use, users can reflect on their own design processes, learn new workflows, and understand others’ design rationale. However, finding interesting moments in design activities can be challenging: they contain multimodal data (such as user motion and logged events) occurring over time which can be difficult to specify when searching, and are typically distributed over many sessions or recordings. We present Tesseract, a Worlds-in-Miniature-based system to expressively query VR spatial design recordings. Tesseract consists of the Search Cube interface acting as a centralized stage-to-search container, and four querying tools for specifying multimodal data to enable users to find interesting moments in past design activities. We studied ten participants who used Tesseract and found support for our miniature-based stage-to-search approach.

Starving the Newsfeed for Social Media Detox: Effects of Strict and Self-regulated Facebook Newsfeed Diets,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581187,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581187,"
 Doomsurfing, doomscrolling or zombie scrolling. These new additions to the tech vocabulary have become part of our everyday routine, scrolling endlessly through social media feeds. Furthermore, some users report a sense of compulsion, a decrease in mental wellbeing and an increased sense of distraction. A common complaint among users harks back to the Facebook newsfeed. In a field experiment with real Facebook users (), we investigate the difference between a strict newsfeed diet (where the newsfeed is automatically reduced to a minimum) and self-regulated newsfeed diet (where the newsfeed is reduced, but users can then manage its content). Our results indicate that both of these newsfeed diets are effective at reducing the time spent on Facebook’s platform ( for the strict diet, % for the self-regulated diet). Our findings also suggest that these design interventions come with positive and negative user experiences such as increased self-awareness and fear of missing out (FOMO).

AeroRigUI: Actuated TUIs for Spatial Interaction using Rigging Swarm Robots on Ceilings in Everyday Space,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581437,0,,"
 We present AeroRigUI, an actuated tangible UI for 3D spatial embodied interaction. Using strings controlled by self-propelled swarm robots with a reeling mechanism on ceiling surfaces, our approach enables rigging (control through strings) physical objects’ position and orientation in the air. This can be applied to novel interactions in 3D space, including dynamic physical affordances, 3D information displays, and haptics. Utilizing the ceiling, an often underused room area, AeroRigUI can be applied for a range of applications such as room organization, data physicalization, and animated expressions. We demonstrate the applications based on our proof-of-concept prototype, which includes the hardware design of the rigging robots, named RigBots, and the software design for mid-air object control via interactive string manipulation. We also introduce technical evaluation and analysis of our approach prototype to address the hardware feasibility and safety. Overall, AeroRigUI enables a novel spatial and tangible UI system with great controllability and deployability.

What's the Norm Around Here? Individuals' Responses Can Mitigate the Effects of Misinformation Prevalence in Shaping Perceptions of a Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580946,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580946,"
 Social norms play a significant role in how conspiratorial content and related misinformation impact online communities. However, less is understood about the mechanisms by which particular aspects of a community may drive perceptions of social norms in the community. Using anti-vaccine conspiracies as a testbed, this paper experimentally examines three such features and their relationships : prevalence of conspiratorial content, community response, and explicit community rules. Results show that prevalence of content has a significant effect on norm perceptions, while the results did not support the effects of explicit rule on norm perceptions. However, these effects can be mitigated by the way a community responds to such content. Furthermore, perceived norms also influence other expectations about the community, from escalated behaviors to belief in other conspiracy theories. The paper concludes by highlighting the implications of these findings for online platform design, for community governance, and for future research about the relationships among conspiratorial content and norm perceptions.

“The World is Designed for Fluent People”: Benefits and Challenges of Videoconferencing Technologies for People Who Stutter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580788,0,https://www.shaomei.info/pdfs/Stuttering_VC_preprint.pdf,"
 This work studies the experiences of people who stutter (PWS) with videoconferencing (VC) and VC technologies. Our interview study with 13 adults who stutter uncovers extra challenges introduced by current VC platforms to people who stutter. While some of the challenges are a direct result of the characteristics of stuttering (e.g. people/systems mistaking pauses as end of turn), a bigger yet less visible challenge comes with the significant amount of emotional and cognitive effort required to manage one’s speech and identity over VC, in which people’s existing communication strategies - such as body language and eye contact - are under-supported and their biggest discomfort - such as seeing oneself stutter - are exacerbated by preset features like self view. Overall, our work sheds light on the structural barriers and the opportunities for PWS to engage and enjoy virtual communications via VC technologies.

 Ethnic community-based organizations (CBOs) play an essential role in supporting the wellbeing of immigrants and refugees. CBO workers often act as linguistic and cultural translators between communities, government, and health and social service systems. However, resource constraints, technological barriers, and pressures to be data-driven require workers to perform additional forms of translation to ensure their organizations’ survival. Drawing on 16 interviews with members of 7 Asian American and Pacific Islander CBOs, we examine opportunities and barriers concerning their technology-mediated work practices. We identify two circumstances where CBO workers perform translation: (1) as legitimacy work to build trust with funders and communities, and (2) as (re)mediation in attending to technological barriers and resisting hegemonic systems that treat their communities as “other.” By unpacking the politics of translation work across these sites, we position CBO workers as a critical source for HCI research and practice as it seeks to support community wellbeing.

Multiuser Privacy and Security Conflicts in the Cloud,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581307,0,https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/219117614/Cloud_MCs_1.pdf,"
 Collaborative cloud platforms make it easier and more convenient for multiple users to work together on files (GoogleDocs, Office365) and store and share them (Dropbox, OneDrive). However, this can lead to privacy and security conflicts between the users involved, for instance when a user adds someone to a shared folder or changes its permissions. Such multiuser conflicts (MCs), though known to happen in the literature, have not yet been studied in-depth. In this paper, we report a study with 1,050 participants about MCs they experienced in the cloud. We show what are the MCs that arise when multiple users work together in the cloud and how and why they arise, what is the prevalence and severity of MCs, what are their consequences on users, and how do users work around MCs. We derive recommendations for designing mechanisms to help users avoid, mitigate, and resolve MCs in the cloud.

Interface Design for Crowdsourcing Hierarchical Multi-Label Text Annotations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581431,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02990,"
Human data labeling is an important and expensive task at the heart of supervised learning systems. Hierarchies help humans understand and organize concepts. We ask whether and how concept hierarchies can inform the design of annotation interfaces to improve labeling quality and efficiency. We study this question through annotation of vaccine misinformation, where the labeling task is difficult and highly subjective. We investigate 6 user interface designs for crowdsourcing hierarchical labels by collecting over 18,000 individual annotations. Under a fixed budget, integrating hierarchies into the design improves crowdsource workers’ F1 scores. We attribute this to (1) Grouping similar concepts, improving F1 scores by +0.16 over random groupings, (2) Strong relative performance on high-difficulty examples (relative F1 score difference of +0.40), and (3) Filtering out obvious negatives, increasing precision by +0.07. Ultimately, labeling schemes integrating the hierarchy outperform those that do not — achieving mean F1 of 0.70.

The Halting problem: Video analysis of self-driving cars in traffic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581045,0,,"
 Using publicly uploaded videos of the Waymo and Tesla FSD self-driving cars, this paper documents how self-driving vehicles still struggle with some basics of road interaction. To drive safely self-driving cars need to interact in traffic with other road users. Yet traffic is a complex, long established social domain. We focus on one core element of road interaction: when road users yield for each other. Yielding – such as by slowing down for others in traffic – involves communication between different road users to decide who will ‘go’ and who will ‘yield’. Videos of the Waymo and Tesla FSD self-driving cars show how these systems fail to both yield for others, as well as failing to go when yielded to. In discussion, we explore how these ‘problems’ illustrate both the complexity of designing for road interaction, but also how the space of physical machine/human social interactions more broadly can be designed for.

 Designing privacy-respecting and human-centric smart cities requires a careful investigation of people’s attitudes and concerns toward city-wide data collection scenarios. To capture a holistic view, we carried out this investigation in two phases. We first surfaced people’s understanding, concerns, and expectations toward smart city scenarios by conducting 21 semi-structured interviews with people in underserved communities. We complemented this in-depth qualitative study with a 348-participant online survey of the general population to quantify the significance of smart city factors (e.g., type of collected data) on attitudes and concerns. Depending on demographics, privacy and ethics were the two most common types of concerns among participants. We found the type of collected data to have the most and the retention time to have the least impact on participants’ perceptions and concerns about smart cities. We highlight key takeaways and recommendations for city stakeholders to consider when designing inclusive and protective smart cities.

Using Geometric Features of Drag-and-Drop Trajectories to Understand Students' Learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581143,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581143,"
Herein, we present two studies on how students’ Psychological State of Decision difficulty (PSD) relates to two aspects of learning, i.e., guessing behavior and learning achievement. To measure PSD, we extracted geometric features from trajectories of drag-and-drop touch interactions collected while students aged 7–10 played a math game on a tablet device. In the first study, we explored whether eight geometric features extracted from 97,303 trial trajectories could be grouped to understand students’ PSD. In the second study, we examined whether the two aspects of learning could be predicted using the data collected from 187 students with geometric features indicating their PSD. This work provides empirical evidence that geometric features can be grouped into two types of PSD in the context of learning, including conflict and uncertainty. Moreover, our results demonstrate that data on students’ PSD collected from drag-and-drop trajectories can be used to predict learning.

 We introduce ThrowIO, a novel style of actuated tangible user interface that facilitates throwing and catching spatial interaction powered by mobile wheeled robots on overhanging surfaces. In our approach, users throw and stick objects that are embedded with magnets to an overhanging ferromagnetic surface where wheeled robots can move and drop them at desired locations, allowing users to catch them. The thrown objects are tracked with an RGBD camera system to perform closed-loop robotic manipulations. By computationally facilitating throwing and catching interaction, our approach can be applied in many applications including kinesthetic learning, gaming, immersive haptic experience, ceiling storage, and communication. We demonstrate the applications with a proof-of-concept system enabled by wheeled robots, ceiling hardware design, and software control. Overall, ThrowIO opens up novel spatial, dynamic, and tangible interaction for users via overhanging robots, which has great potential to be integrated into our everyday space.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners who share an interest in using data physicalizations to solve real-world problems. Hence, we aim to further explore the utility of physicalization for different domains that (already) apply data physicalization in their practices (e.g., sustainability, office vitality, education, and personal informatics). The objective of the workshop is to combine the expertise of researchers working in physicalization and/or exemplar domains to (i) develop an understanding of common challenges, (ii) map out overarching factors across domains, (ii) operationalize design strategies for common domains, and (iv) reflect on the implementation of data physicalizations for different domains. Upon completion of our workshop, we plan to create a BIT Special Issue addressing the challenges and potential directions of the domain application of data physicalizations.

 Digital painting interfaces require an input fidelity that preserves the artistic expression of the user. Drawing tablets allow for precise and low-latency sensing of pen motions and other parameters like pressure to convert them to fully digitized strokes. A drawback is that those interfaces are rigid. While soft brushes can be simulated in software, the haptic sensation of the rigid pen input device is different compared to using a soft wet brush on paper. We present InfinitePaint, a system that supports digital painting in Virtual Reality on real paper with a real wet brush. We use special paper that turns black wherever it comes into contact with water and turns blank again upon drying. A single camera captures those temporary strokes and digitizes them while applying properties like color or other digital effects. We tested our system with artists and compared the subjective experience with a drawing tablet.

 This paper examines the social, technological, and emotional labor of maintaining China’s data-driven governance broadly, and dynamic zero-COVID management in particular. Drawing on ethnographic research in China, we examine the sociotechnical work of maintenance during the 2022 Shanghai lockdown. This labor included coordinating mass testing, quarantine, and lockdown procedures as well as implementing ad-hoc technological workarounds and managing public sentiments. We demonstrate that, far from being effected from the top down, China’s data-driven governance relies on the circumscribed participation of citizens. During Shanghai’s lockdown, citizens with relevant expertise helped to maintain technological stability by fixing or programming data systems, but also to ensure the ongoing production of“positive feelings” about social stability through data-driven governance. In so doing, such citizens simultaneously enacted an ambivalent and circumscribed form of agency, and maintained social and by extension political stability. This article sheds light on data-driven governance and political processes of maintenance.

SAWSense: Using Surface Acoustic Waves for Surface-bound Event Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580991,0,,"
 Enabling computing systems to understand user interactions with everyday surfaces and objects can drive a wide range of applications. However, existing vibration-based sensors (e.g., accelerometers) lack the sensitivity to detect light touch gestures or the bandwidth to recognize activity containing high-frequency components. Conversely, microphones are highly susceptible to environmental noise, degrading performance. Each time an object impacts a surface, Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) are generated that propagate along the air-to-surface boundary. This work repurposes a Voice PickUp Unit (VPU) to capture SAWs on surfaces (including smooth surfaces, odd geometries, and fabrics) over long distances and in noisy environments. Our custom-designed signal acquisition, processing, and machine learning pipeline demonstrates utility in both interactive and activity recognition applications, such as classifying trackpad-style gestures on a desk and recognizing 16 cooking-related activities, all with >97% accuracy. Ultimately, SAWs offer a unique signal that can enable robust recognition of user touch and on-surface events.

In this paper, we reframe hobbyist CNC milling as writing literate programs which interleave documentation, interactive graphics, and source code for machine control. To test this approach, we present Imprimer, a machine infrastructure for a CNC mill and an associated library for a computational notebook. Imprimer lets makers learn experimentally, prototype new interactions for making, and understand physical processes by writing and debugging code. We demonstrate three experimental milling workflows as computational notebooks, conduct a user study with practitioners with a range of backgrounds, and discuss literate programming as a future vision for digital fabrication altogether.

We describe our approach in creating this dataset with private content in an ethical way, including using props rather than participants’ own private objects and balancing multi-disciplinary perspectives (e.g., accessibility, privacy, computer vision) to meet the tangible metrics (e.g., diversity, category, amount of content) to support AI innovations. We observed challenges that our participants encountered during the data collection, including accessibility issues (e.g., understanding foreground vs. background object placement) and issues due to the sensitive nature of the content (e.g., discomfort in capturing some props such as condoms around family members).

Despite the potential of Virtual Reality as the next computing platform for general purposes, current systems are tailored to stationary settings to support expansive interaction in mid-air. However, in mobile scenarios, the physical constraints of the space surrounding the user may be prohibitively small for spatial interaction in VR with classical controllers. In this paper, we present HandyCast, a smartphone-based input technique that enables full-range 3D input with two virtual hands in VR while requiring little physical space, allowing users to operate large virtual environments in mobile settings. HandyCast defines a pose-and-touch transfer function that fuses the phone’s position and orientation with touch input to derive two individual 3D hand positions. Holding their phone like a gamepad, users can thus move and turn it to independently control their virtual hands. Touch input using the thumbs fine-tunes the respective virtual hand position and controls object selection. We evaluated HandyCast in three studies, comparing its performance with that of Go-Go, a classic bimanual controller technique. In our open-space study, participants required significantly less physical motion using HandyCast with no decrease in completion time or body ownership. In our space-constrained study, participants achieved significantly faster completion times, smaller interaction volumes, and shorter path lengths with HandyCast compared to Go-Go. In our technical evaluation, HandyCast’s fully standalone inside-out 6D tracking performance again incurred no decrease in completion time compared to an outside-in tracking baseline.

 This paper explores using mixed reality (MR) mirrors for supporting improvisational dance making. Motivated by the prevalence of mirrors in dance studios and inspired by Forsythe’s Improvisation Technologies, we conducted workshops with 13 dancers and choreographers to inform the design of future MR visualisation and annotation tools for dance. The workshops involved using a prototype MR mirror as a technology probe that reveals the spatial and temporal relationships between the reflected dancing body and its surroundings during improvisation; speed dating group interviews around future design ideas; follow-up surveys and extended interviews with a digital media dance artist and a dance educator. Our findings highlight how the MR mirror enriches dancers’ temporal and spatial perception, creates multi-layered presence, and affords appropriation by dancers. We also discuss the unique place of MR mirrors in the theoretical context of dance and in the history of movement visualisation, and distil lessons for broader HCI research.

The emergent, dynamic nature of privacy concerns in a shifting sociotechnical landscape creates a constant need for privacy-related resources and education. One response to this need is community-based privacy groups. We studied privacy groups that host meetings in diverse urban communities and interviewed the meeting organizers to see how they grapple with potentially varied and changeable privacy concerns. Our analysis identified three features of how privacy groups are organized to serve diverse constituencies: situating (finding the right venue for meetings), structuring (finding the right format/content for the meeting), and providing support (offering varied dimensions of assistance). We use these findings to inform a discussion of “privacy pluralism” as a perennial challenge for the HCI privacy research community, and we use the practices of privacy groups as an anchor for reflection on research practices.

However, the extent to which these tools are being adopted and satisfying the mental health needs amongst perinatal Black women is underexplored. To address this gap, we surveyed 101 pregnant and postpartum Black women in the U.S. Despite prior work showing low utilization of mental health services amongst Black women, our results show more than half of our participants using specific digital tools for mental health support (e.g., mobile apps and social media). Importantly, use and satisfaction with these tools varied by subgroups (e.g., income and education level). We use our findings to present recommendations for digital mental health intervention research that incorporates an understanding of intersectional identities during the perinatal period.

We conducted a study with 204 participants comparing the effects of AI-framed Questioning on a critical thinking task; discernment of logical validity of socially divisive statements. Our results show that compared to no feedback and even causal AI explanations of an always correct system, AI-framed Questioning significantly increase human discernment of logically flawed statements. Our experiment exemplifies a future style of Human-AI co-reasoning system, where the AI becomes a critical thinking stimulator rather than an information teller.

Using inclusive design principles, we arrive at four digital ruler designs - Grey Bar, Lightbox, Shade, and Underline. For the first time, we offer a comprehensive evaluation of digital ruler effectiveness on 91 crowdsourced readers with dyslexia and 86 without. Considering reading speed, comprehension, and preference, many readers benefit from these rulers, with the largest gains among readers with dyslexia. Rulers designed by readers with dyslexia increased the reading speeds of readers with dyslexia, supporting the need for inclusive design practices.

Surface I/O is a novel interface approach that functionalizes the exterior surface of devices to provide haptic and touch sensing without dedicated mechanical components. Achieving this requires a unique combination of surface features spanning the macro-scale (5cm ∼ 1mm), meso-scale (1mm ∼ 200μm), and micro-scale (<200μm). This approach simplifies interface creation, allowing designers to iterate on form geometry, haptic feeling, and sensing functionality without the limitations of mechanical mechanisms. We believe this can contribute to the concept of ""invisible ubiquitous interactivity at scale"", where the simplicity and easy implementation of the technique allows it to blend with objects around us. While we prototyped our designs using 3D printers and laser cutters, our technique is applicable to mass production methods, including injection molding and stamping, enabling passive goods with new levels of interactivity.

I investigate (1) how contextual factors influence reactions to a spear-phishing attempt, (2) why people report or do not report phishing attempts, (3) which opportunities for security-enhancing interventions people identify. I use an in-situ deception methodology to observe participants (N=14) in their realistic work environment. I triangulate observational and self-reported data to obtain rich qualitative insights into participants’ emotions, thoughts, and actions when receiving a targeted phishing email. I find that task, IT, internal and social context play an important role. The email’s request being aligned with expectations and perceived time pressure when responding to emails were associated with insecure behavior. The social context positively influenced phishing detection, but “phished” participants did not tell anyone.

We examine how two prominent food delivery platforms in India, Swiggy and Zomato, produce a managed digital workforce using a combination of algorithmic control and traditional labor management strategies. Our findings draw from interviews conducted with 13 food delivery workers and a critical discourse analysis of news media coverage. We found that the two platforms combine piece wage restructuring, granular datafication practices, and the use of benevolent language as neoliberal social control mechanisms. We find that this combination of technological governance and strategic managerial practices is a mutually constitutive method of control that restructures labor processes, extracts workers’ compliance and consent, and prevents work disruption. We show that contemporary platform companies draw from strategies that have historically been deployed in industrial labor management. By examining how older and newer regimes of social control and exploitation are strategically intertwined in contemporary platform design, we contribute a historically situated understanding of platform labor that moves beyond dualistic interpretations of “traditional” labor management practices and more recent algorithmic modes of control. Our findings contribute to recent debates in tech labor and algorithmic control by examining how contemporary conditions of precarious work reactivate certain past forms of control and in doing so normalize extreme overwork, exhaustion, speedups, and injuries.

How Can Deep Neural Networks Aid Visualization Perception Research? Three Studies on Correlation Judgments in Scatterplots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581111,0,,"
How deep neural networks can aid visualization perception research is a wide-open question. This paper provides insights from three perspectives—prediction, generalization, and interpretation—via training and analyzing deep convolutional neural networks on human correlation judgments in scatterplots across three studies. The first study assesses the accuracy of twenty-nine neural network architectures in predicting human judgments, finding that a subset of the architectures (e.g., VGG-19) has comparable accuracy to the best-performing regression analyses in prior research. The second study shows that the resulting models from the first study display better generalizability than prior models on two other judgment datasets for different scatterplot designs. The third study interprets visual features learned by a convolutional neural network model, providing insights about how the model makes predictions, and identifies potential features that could be investigated in human correlation perception studies. Together, this paper suggests that deep neural networks can serve as a tool for visualization perception researchers in devising potential empirical study designs and hypothesizing about perpetual judgments. The preprint, data, code, and training logs are available at https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/exa8m.

Older adults are increasingly acting as caregivers, given population aging and pervasive caregiver shortages. Meanwhile, gig-economy-based carework platforms have also become popular. As older adults are one of the fastest-growing groups of informal caregivers and technology users in the past decade, we conducted an online survey among older adults residing in the US (N = 193) about how they use these platforms to manage their caregiving tasks. We identified factors related to their frequency of using caregiving help and their intention to continue using caregiving help via carework platforms. We also reported how and why older adults use these platforms, their main concerns and needs related to these platforms, and their most significant positive and negative experiences. Our findings contribute to a foundational understanding of how older caregivers use carework platforms and how such platforms could be better designed to suit the needs and wants of older caregivers.

 As data plays an increasing role in civic decision making, diverse organizations are facing pressure to engage in data work. The HCI community has explored both the potential of and challenges to integrating robust data practices in mission-driven organizations. At each step – from collection, to storage, to analysis, to maintenance – these organizations need to develop tools and practices that balance internal operational needs and external community priorities. This work reports on an 11 month-long collaboration with a mission-driven hybrid organization that has designed tools and procedures for collecting data that enact an ethic of care. This caring data practice is characterized by defining success through relationships, attending to the social and cultural community context, and protecting vulnerable populations through non-collection. We share the organization’s practices, analyze how they support the organization in providing care, and offer recommendations for building caring data systems.

 Recent years have seen a rise in social virtual reality (VR) platforms that allow people to interact in real-time through voice and gestures. The ephemeral nature of communication on these platforms can enable new forms of harmful behavior and new challenges for moderators. We performed virtual field research on three VR environments (AltspaceVR, Horizon Worlds, Rec Room). Based on observing 100 scheduled events, our analysis uncovered 13 distinct types of potentially harmful behaviors enabled by real-time voice, embodied interactions, and platform affordances. We witnessed potential harm at 45% of our observed events; only 24% of these incidents were addressed by moderators. To understand moderation practices, we conducted interviews with 11 moderators to investigate how they assess real-time interactions and how they operate within the current state of moderation tools. Our work sheds light on how moderation tools and practices must evolve to meet the new challenges of social VR.

Let's Face It: Influence of Facial Expressions on Social Presence in Collaborative Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580707,0,,"
As the world becomes more interconnected, physical separation between people increases. Existing collaborative Virtual Reality (VR) applications, designed to bridge this distance, are not yet sufficient in providing a sense of social connection comparable to face-to-face interactions. Possible reasons are the limited multimodality of VR systems and the lack of non-verbal cues in VR avatars. We systematically investigated how facial expressions influence Social Presence in two collaborative VR tasks. We explored four types of facial expressions: eyes and mouth movements, their combination, and no expressions, for two types of explanations: verbal and graphical. To examine how these expressions influence Social Presence, we conducted a controlled VR experiment (N = 48), in which participants had to explain a specific term to their counterpart. Our results demonstrate that eye and mouth movements positively influence Social Presence in VR. Particularly, combining verbal explanations and eye movements induces the highest feeling of co-presence.

 Visual icons provide immediate recognition of features on print maps but do not translate well for touch reading by people who are blind or have low vision due to the low fidelity of tactile perception. We explored 3D printed icons as an equivalent to visual icons for tactile maps addressing these problems. We designed over 200 tactile icons (TactIcons) for street and park maps. These were touch tested by blind and sighted people, resulting in a corpus of 33 icons that can be recognised instantly and a further 34 icons that are easily learned. Importantly, this work has informed the creation of detailed guidelines for the design of TactIcons and a practical methodology for touch testing new TactIcons. It is hoped that this work will contribute to the creation of more inclusive, user-friendly tactile maps for people who are blind or have low vision.

 Conversational agents such as chatbots have emerged as a useful resource to access real-time health information online. Perceptions of trust and credibility among chatbots have been attributed to the anthropomorphism and humanness of the chatbot design, with gender and race influencing their reception. Few existing studies have looked specifically at the diversity of chatbot avatar design related to both race, age, and gender, which may have particular significance for racially minoritized users like Black older adults. In this paper, we explored perceptions of chatbots with varying identities for health information seeking in a diary and interview study with 30 Black older adults. Our findings suggest that while racial and age likeness influence feelings of trust and comfort with chatbots, constructs such as professionalism and likeability and overall familiarity also influence reception. Based on these findings, we provide implications for designing text-based chatbots that consider Black older adults.

 Although youth increasingly communicate with peers online, we know little about how private online channels play a role in providing a supportive environment for youth. To fill this gap, we asked youth to donate their Instagram Direct Messages and filtered them by the phrase “help me.” From this query, we analyzed 82 conversations comprised of 336,760 messages that 42 participants donated. These threads often began as casual conversations among friends or lovers they met offline or online. The conversations evolved into sharing negative experiences about everyday stress (e.g., school, dating) to severe mental health disclosures (e.g., suicide). Disclosures were usually reciprocated with relatable experiences and positive peer support. We also discovered unsupport as a theme, where conversation members denied giving support, a unique finding in the online social support literature. We discuss the role of social media-based private channels and their implications for design in supporting youth’s mental health.

Providing electrical power is essential for nearly all interactive technologies, yet it often remains an afterthought. Some designs handwave power altogether as an “exercise for later.” Others hastily string together batteries to meet the system’s electrical requirements, enclosing them in whatever box fits. Vim is a new approach – it elevates power as a first-class design element; it frees power from being a series of discrete elements, instead catering to exact requirements; it enables power to take on new, flexible forms; it is fabricated using low-cost, accessible materials and technologies; finally, it advances sustainability by being rechargeable, non-toxic, edible, and compostable. Vims are decomposable battery alternatives that rapidly charge and can power small applications for hours. We present Vims, detail their characteristics, offer design guidelines for their fabrication, and explore their use in applications spanning prototyping, fashion, and food, including novel systems that are entirely decomposable and edible.

Interaction of Thoughts: Towards Mediating Task Assignment in Human-AI Cooperation with a Capability-Aware Shared Mental Model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580983,0,,"
 The existing work on task assignment of human-AI cooperation did not consider the differences between individual team members regarding their capabilities, leading to sub-optimal task completion results. In this work, we propose a capability-aware shared mental model (CASMM) with the components of task grouping and negotiation, which utilize tuples to break down tasks into sets of scenarios relating to difficulties and then dynamically merge the task grouping ideas raised by human and AI through negotiation. We implement a prototype system and a 3-phase user study for the proof of concept via an image labeling task. The result shows building CASMM boosts the accuracy and time efficiency significantly through forming the task assignment close to real capabilities within few iterations. It helps users better understand the capability of AI and themselves. Our method has the potential to generalize to other scenarios such as medical diagnoses and automatic driving in facilitating better human-AI cooperation.

 Experiential training, where mental health professionals practice their learned skills, remains the most costly component of therapeutic training. We introduce Pin-MI, a video-call-based tool that supports experiential learning of counseling skills used in motivational interviewing (MI)through interactive role-play as client and counselor. In Pin-MI, counselors annotate, or “pin” the important moments in their role-play sessions in real-time. The pins are then used post-session to facilitate a reflective learning process, in which both client and counselor can provide feedback about what went well or poorly during each pinned moment. We discuss the design of Pin-MI and a qualitative evaluation with a set of healthcare professionals learning MI. Our evaluation suggests that Pin-MI helped users develop empathy, be more aware of their skill usage, guaranteed immediate and targeted feedback, and helped users correct misconceptions about their performance. We discuss implications for the design of experiential training tools for learning counseling skills.

 Intensive care nurses are prone to suffering from chronic stress due to constant exposure to two main profession-related stressors: interruption and time pressure. These stressors have detrimental effects on the well-being of the nursing staff and, by proxy, the patients. To alleviate stress, increase safety, and support the training of stressful scenarios, we investigate the impact these stressors have on subjective and objective stress levels in a virtual environment. We designed an intensive care unit in which participants (n=26, 18 healthcare professionals) perform common tasks, e.g. refilling an infusion pump, whilst being exposed to interruptions and time pressure. Results from our between-subjects study provide data indicating stress increase in both stressor conditions, suggesting that artificially evoking work-related stressors for stress inoculation training (SIT) is a possible extension to simulation training during nursing education. This knowledge is helpful for designing training scenarios of safety-critical situations early in the professional apprenticeship.

How does HCI Understand Human Agency and Autonomy?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580651,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580651,"
Human agency and autonomy have always been fundamental concepts in HCI. New developments, including ubiquitous AI and the growing integration of technologies into our lives, make these issues ever pressing, as technologies increase their ability to influence our behaviours and values. However, in HCI understandings of autonomy and agency remain ambiguous. Both concepts are used to describe a wide range of phenomena pertaining to sense-of-control, material independence, and identity. It is unclear to what degree these understandings are compatible, and how they support the development of research programs and practical interventions. We address this by reviewing 30 years of HCI research on autonomy and agency to identify current understandings, open issues, and future directions. From this analysis, we identify ethical issues, and outline key themes to guide future work. We also articulate avenues for advancing clarity and specificity around these concepts, and for coordinating integrative work across different HCI communities.

 Flat touch interfaces, with or without screens, pervade the modern world. However, their haptic feedback is minimal, prompting much research into haptic and shape-changing display technologies which are self-contained, fast acting, and offer millimeters of displacement while only being only millimeters thick. We present a new, miniaturizable type of shape-changing display using embedded electroosmotic pumps (EEOPs). Our pumps, controlled and powered directly by applied voltage, are 1.5mm in thickness, and allow complete stackups under 5mm. Nonetheless, they can move their entire volume’s worth of fluid in 1 second, and generate pressures of +/-50kPa, enough to create dynamic, millimeter-scale tactile features on a surface that can withstand typical interaction forces (<1N). These are the requisite technical ingredients to enable, for example, a pop-up keyboard on a flat smartphone. We experimentally quantify the mechanical and psychophysical performance of our displays and conclude with a set of example interfaces.

 Technology companies continue to invest in efforts to incorporate responsibility in their Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, while efforts to audit and regulate AI systems expand. This shift towards Responsible AI (RAI) in the tech industry necessitates new practices and adaptations to roles—undertaken by a variety of practitioners in more or less formal positions, many of whom focus on the user-centered aspects of AI. To better understand practices at the intersection of user experience (UX) and RAI, we conducted an interview study with industrial UX practitioners and RAI subject matter experts, both of whom are actively involved in addressing RAI concerns throughout the early design and development of new AI-based prototypes, demos, and products, at a large technology company. Many of the specific practices and their associated challenges have yet to be surfaced in the literature, and distilling them offers a critical view into how practitioners’ roles are adapting to meet present-day RAI challenges. We present and discuss three emerging practices in which RAI is being enacted and reified in UX practitioners’ everyday work. We conclude by arguing that the emerging practices, goals, and types of expertise that surfaced in our study point to an evolution in praxis, with associated challenges that suggest important areas for further research in HCI.

With an improved calibration interface, we collected the gaze data of 20 low vision participants and 20 sighted controls who performed reading tasks on a computer screen; low vision participants were also asked to read with different screen magnifiers. We found that, with an accessible calibration interface and data collection method, commercial eye trackers can collect gaze data of comparable quality from low vision and sighted people. Our study identified low vision people’s unique gaze patterns during reading, building upon which, we propose design implications for gaze-based low vision technology.

We approach the qualitative data from the perspective of Durkheim, who, similarly to how game theorists view games, views religion as a multi-faceted system that incorporates the rules, practices and communities that comprise the religion. From the data emerges the following prominent connection as perceived by both groups of informants: systems of (1) shared premise, (2) resilience and restoration, (3) symbolism, (4) extended reality and (5) day-to-day structuring. A numerical view of the data shows that 42,5% of the participants did not perceive similarities, and examination of these responses suggested that while religion and pervasive games share functional similarities, they are further apart from a substantive perspective.

User-Driven Constraints for Layout Optimisation in Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580873,0,https://hal.science/hal-04042351/document,"
Automatic layout optimisation allows users to arrange augmented reality content in the real-world environment without the need for tedious manual interactions. This optimisation is often based on modelling the intended content placement as constraints, defined as cost functions. Then, applying a cost minimization algorithm leads to a desirable placement. However, such an approach is limited by the lack of user control over the optimisation results. In this paper we explore the concept of user-driven constraints for augmented reality layout optimisation. With our approach users can define and set up their own constraints directly within the real-world environment. We first present a design space composed of three dimensions: the constraints, the regions of interest and the constraint parameters. Then we explore which input gestures can be employed to define the user-driven constraints of our design space through a user elicitation study. Using the results of the study, we propose a holistic system design and implementation demonstrating our user-driven constraints, which we evaluate in a final user study where participants had to create several constraints at the same time to arrange a set of virtual contents.

Voice recognition and background capture are employed to automate the creation of text and images as AR content.

Online critique communities (OCCs) provide a convenient space for creators to solicit feedback on their artifacts and improve skills. Creators’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement with comments on their works contribute to their skill development. However, what kinds of critique creators feel engaging may change with the creation stage of their shared artifacts. In this paper, we first model three dimensions of engagement expressed in creators’ replies to peer comments. Then we quantitatively examine how their engagement is affected by artifacts’ stage and feedback characteristics via regression analysis. Results show that creators sharing works-in-progress tend to exhibit lower behavioral and emotional engagement, but higher cognitive engagement than those sharing complete works. The increase in the valence of the feedback is associated with a stronger increase in behavior engagement for seekers sharing complete works than works-in-progress. Finally, we discuss how our insights could benefit OCCs and other online help-seeking platforms.

Smart shape-changing materials can be adapted to different usages, which have been leveraged for dynamic affordances and on-demand haptic feedback in HCI. However, the applicability of these materials is often bottlenecked by their complex fabrication and the challenge of programming localized and individually addressable responses. In this work, we propose a toolkit for designing and fabricating programmable morphing objects using off-the-shelf epoxies. Our method involves varying the crosslinker to epoxy resin ratio to control morphing temperatures from 40 ℃ to 90 ℃, either across different regions of a shape memory device or across devices.

A toolbox of fabrication methods and a primitive design library are introduced to support design ideation and programmable morphing. Finally, we demonstrate application examples, including morphing toys, a shape-changing input device, and an active window shutter.

This paper investigates how a smartphone-controlled olfactory wearable might improve memory recall. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 32 participants using the device and without (control). In the experimental condition, bursts of odor were released during visuo-spatial memory navigation tasks, and replayed during sleep the following night in the subjects’ home. We found that compared to control, there was an improvement in memory performance when using the scent wearable in memory tasks that involved walking in a physical space. Furthermore, participants recalled more objects and translations when re-exposed to the same scent during the recall test, in addition to during sleep. These effects were statistically significant, and, in the object recall task, they also persisted for more than one week. This experiment demonstrates a potential practical application of olfactory interfaces that can interact with a user during wake as well as sleep to support memory.

ESCAPE: Countering Systematic Errors from Machine's Blind Spots via Interactive Visual Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581373,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09657,"
 Classification models learn to generalize the associations between data samples and their target classes. However, researchers have increasingly observed that machine learning practice easily leads to systematic errors in AI applications, a phenomenon referred to as “AI blindspots.” Such blindspots arise when a model is trained with training samples (e.g., cat/dog classification) where important patterns (e.g., black cats) are missing or periphery/undesirable patterns (e.g., dogs with grass background) are misleading towards a certain class. Even more sophisticated techniques cannot guarantee to capture, reason about, and prevent the spurious associations. In this work, we propose ESCAPE, a visual analytic system that promotes a human-in-the-loop workflow for countering systematic errors. By allowing human users to easily inspect spurious associations, the system facilitates users to spontaneously recognize concepts associated misclassifications and evaluate mitigation strategies that can reduce biased associations. We also propose two statistical approaches, relative concept association to better quantify the associations between a concept and instances, and debias method to mitigate spurious associations. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed ESCAPE system and statistical measures through extensive evaluation including quantitative experiments, usage scenarios, expert interviews, and controlled user experiments.

Physically Situated Tools for Exploring a Grain Space in Computational Machine Knitting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581434,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581434,"
 We propose an approach to enabling exploratory creativity in digital fabrication through the use of grain spaces. In material processes, “grain” describes underlying physical properties like the orientation of cellulose fibers in wood that, in aggregate, affect fabrication concerns (such as directional cutting) and outcomes (such as axes of strength and visual effects). Extending this into the realm of computational fabrication, grain spaces define a curated set of mid-level material properties as well as the underlying low-level fabrication processes needed to produce them. We specify a grain space for computational brioche knitting, use it to guide our production of a set of hybrid digital/physical tools to support quick and playful exploration of this space’s unique design affordances, and reflect on the role of such tools in creative practice.

VR Almost There: Simulating Co-located Multiplayer Experiences in Social Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581230,0,,"
 Consumer social virtual reality (VR) applications have recently started to enable social interactions at a distance. Yet it is still relatively unknown if and to what extent such applications provide meaningful social experiences in cases where in-person leisure activities are not feasible. To explore this, we developed a custom social VR application and conducted an exploratory lab study with 25 dyads in which we compared an in-person and a virtual version of a co-located multiplayer scenario. Our mixed-methods analysis revealed that both scenarios created a socially rich atmosphere and strengthened the social closeness between players. However, the lack of facial animations, limited body language, and a low field of view led to VR’s main social experiential limitations: a reduced mutual awareness and emotional understanding compared to the in-person scenario. We derive implications for social VR design and research as well as game user research.

LipIO: Enabling Lips as both Input and Output Surface,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580775,0,https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/wp-content/uploads/projects/body_interaction/LipIO/Jingu_chi23-LipIO.pdf,"
Abstract. We engineered LipIO, a novel device enabling the lips to be used simultaneously as an input and output surface. LipIO comprises two overlapping flexible electrode arrays: an outward-facing array for capacitive touch and a lip-facing array for electrotactile stimulation. While wearing LipIO, users feel the interface's state via lip stimulation and respond by touching their lip with their tongue or opposing lip. More importantly, LipIO provides co-located tactile feedback that allows users to feel where in the lip they are touching—this is key to enabling eyes- and hands-free interactions. Our three studies verified participants perceived electrotactile output on their lips and subsequently touched the target location with their tongue with an average accuracy of 93%, while wearing LipIO with five I/O electrodes with co-located feedback. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of LipIO in four exemplary applications that illustrate how it enables new types of eyes- and hands-free micro-interactions.

 Today’s youth face many mental health challenges and are increasingly represented in psychiatric hospitalizations. Scholars have sought to understand social media’s role in mental health issues, but limited work has explored TikTok—the video-centric social media platform that is popular with youth—and people’s connections around psychiatric hospitalization experiences. In this study, we used qualitative content analysis to examine a random sample of 140 TikTok posts related to psychiatric hospitalization. We found that members of this population frequently utilize humor to create and maintain a positive and supportive community with each other. We also describe how TikTok’s design affords these interactions among community members, and conclude with a series of provocations for researchers and designers working at the intersections of social media and mental illness. We hope our study provides insights for how to further support rather than just censor youth in using creative outlets to connect with each other.

 Mid-air gestures, widely used in today’s Augmented Reality (AR) applications, are prone to the “gorilla arm” effect, leading to discomfort with prolonged interactions. While prior work has proposed metrics to quantify this effect and means to improve comfort and ergonomics, these works usually only consider simplistic, one-dimensional AR interactions, like reaching for a point or pushing a button. However, interacting with AR environments also involves far more complex tasks, such as rotational knobs, potentially impacting ergonomics. This paper advances the understanding of the ergonomics of rotational mid-air interactions in AR. For this, we contribute the results of a controlled experiment exposing the participants to a rotational task in the interaction space defined by their arms’ reach. Based on the results, we discuss how novel future mid-air gesture modalities benefit from our findings concerning ergonomic-aware rotational interaction.

CrowdIDEA: Blending Crowd Intelligence and Data Analytics to Empower Causal Reasoning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581021,0,,"
 Causal reasoning is crucial for people to understand data, make decisions, or take action. However, individuals often have blind spots and overlook alternative hypotheses, and using only data is insufficient for causal reasoning. We designed and implemented CrowdIDEA, a novel tool consisting of a three-panel integration incorporating the crowd’s beliefs (Crowd Panel with two designs), data analytics (Data Panel), and user’s causal diagram (Diagram Panel) to stimulate causal reasoning. Through an experiment with 54 participants, we showed the significant effects of the Crowd Panel designs on the outcomes of causal reasoning, such as an increased number of causal beliefs generated. Participants also devised new strategies for bootstrapping, strengthening, deepening, and explaining their causal beliefs, as well as taking advantage of the unique characteristics of both qualitative and quantitative data sources to reduce potential biases in reasoning. Our work makes theoretical and design implications for exploratory causal reasoning.

Sustainable HCI and Human-Food-Interaction research have developing interest in preventing food waste through food sharing. Sustainability requires attention to both the opportunities and challenges associated with the building of food sharing groups engaged in the redistribution of food but also in developing a wider agenda which includes, for instance, the local production of food resources. In this paper, we argue for a better understanding of the different conceptions of ‘fairness’ which inform volunteer and guest practice and in turn mediate community-building efforts. We examine the practices surrounding ‘SharingEvent’ and challenges faced to sustainability by the heterogenous, and sometimes contested, commitments of the people involved. We further consider how ICT provided opportunities for explicit examination of ideological differences concerning what ‘sharing’ might mean. Our findings show that community building is dependent on the negotiation of different values and purposes identified. We derive recommendations for action-oriented researchers ultimately concerned with systemic transformation.

Characteristics of Deep and Skim Reading on Smartphones vs. Desktop: A Comparative Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581174,0,,"
 Deep reading fosters text comprehension, memory, and critical thinking. The growing prevalance of digital reading on mobile interfaces raises concerns that deep reading is being replaced by skimming and sifting through information, but this is currently unmeasured. Traditionally, reading quality is assessed using comprehension tests, which require readers to explicitly answer a set of carefully composed questions. To quantify and understand reading behaviour in natural settings and at scale, however, implicit measures are needed of deep versus skim reading across desktop and mobile devices, the most prominent digital reading platforms. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically induce deep and skim reading and subsequently train classifiers to discriminate these two reading styles based on eye movement patterns and interaction data. Based on a user study with 29 participants, we created models that detect deep reading on both devices with up to 0.82 AUC. We present the characteristics of deep reading and discuss how our models can be used to measure the effect of reading UI design and monitor long-term changes in reading behaviours.

Providing users with a haptic sensation of the hardness and softness of objects in virtual reality is an open challenge. While physical props and haptic devices help, their haptic properties do not allow for dynamic adjustments. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel technique for changing the perceived stiffness of objects based on a visuo-haptic illusion. We achieved this by manipulating the hands’ Control-to-Display (C/D) ratio in virtual reality while pressing down on an object with fixed stiffness. In the first study (N=12), we determine the detection thresholds of the illusion. Our results show that we can exploit a C/D ratio from 0.7 to 3.5 without user detection. In the second study (N=12), we analyze the illusion’s impact on the perceived stiffness. Our results show that participants perceive the objects to be up to 28.1% softer and 8.9% stiffer, allowing for various haptic applications in virtual reality.

Wearables are a potentially vital mechanism for individuals to monitor their health, track behaviors, and stay connected. Unfortunately, both price and a lack of consideration of the needs of low-SES communities have made these devices inaccessible and unusable for communities that would most substantially benefit from their affordances. To address this gap and better understand how members of low-SES communities perceive the potential benefits and barriers to using wearable devices, we conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with people from minority, high crime rate, low-SES communities. Participants emphasized a critical need for safety-related wearable devices in their communities. Still, existing tools do not yet address the specific needs of this community and are out of reach due to several barriers. We distill themes on perceived useful features and ongoing obstacles to guide a much-needed research agenda we term ’Equityware’: building wearable devices based on low-SES communities’ needs, comfortability, and limitations.

 It has been shown that providing explanations about AI-based systems’ decisions can be an effective way to increase users’ trust and acceptance. The effect of explanation design in smart home systems on users’ acceptance and perceptions is however less known. We therefore explored the effect of different explanation designs on acceptance in the context of the Philips Hue smart home lighting system. We conducted interviews (N = 10) and an online experiment (N = 452) using three everyday smart home lighting scenarios with different explanation types. The results showed that although participants indicated a positive attitude towards explanations, receiving an explanation can potentially reduce the perceived control of the lighting system. Furthermore, participants preferred system-based explanations rather than user-based explanations. Our study also provides recommendations for the design of explanations in smart home systems.

 This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together.  Following a successful workshop in 2022, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations.

Technology helped participants identify sales and coupons, search for recipes and health-related insights to address diet and health concerns, and share information. We contribute design implications (e.g., amplifying optimization behaviors and social engagement, leveraging substitutions) in support of food agency. We further contribute three emergent archetypes to convey central shopping tendencies (i.e., inventory shoppers, menu planners, and adaptive shoppers) and identify corresponding design implications.

With Augmented Reality (AR) face filters, it becomes possible to literally change how one sees oneself or others. In this paper, we explore privately applied AR filters during online public speaking. Private means that these effects are only visible to the speaker. To investigate this possibly controversial concept, we conducted an online survey with 100 respondents to gather a diverse set of initial impressions, possible boundaries, and guidelines. Following this, we built a prototype of a private AR web-based video-calling application, and pilot-tested it with 16 participants to gain more in-depth insights.

 We present a soma design process of a digital musical instrument grounded in the designer’s first-person perspective of practicing Dalcroze eurhythmics, a pedagogical approach to learning music through movement. Our goal is to design an instrument that invites musicians to experience music as movement. The designer engaged in the soma design process, by first sensitising her body through Dalcroze training. Subsequently, she articulated her bodily experiences into experiential design qualities that guided the making of the instrument. The process resulted in the design of a large suspended mobile played by touching it with bare skin. We shared our instrument with 7 professional musicians and observed how it inspires a variety of approaches to musical meaning-making, ranging from exploring sound, to choreographing the body. Finally, we discuss how engaging with Dalcroze eurhythmics can be generative to the design of music–movement interaction.

Extended Reality (XR) technology brings exciting possibilities for aeroplane passengers, allowing them to escape their limited cabin space. Using nearby physical surfaces enables a connection with the real world while improving the XR experience through touch. However, available surfaces may be located in awkward positions, reducing comfort and input performance and thus limiting their long-term use. We explore the usability of passive haptic surfaces in different orientations, assessing their effects on input performance, user experience and comfort. We then overcome ergonomic issues caused by the confined space by using perceptual manipulation techniques that remap the position and rotation of physical surfaces and user movements, assessing their effects on task workload, comfort and presence. Our results show that the challenges posed by constrained seating environments can be overcome by a combination of passive haptics and remapping the workspace with moderate translation and rotation manipulations. These manipulations allow for good input performance, low workload and comfortable interaction, opening up XR use while in transit.

A semi-automated manufacturing system that entails human intervention in the middle of the process is a representative collaborative system that requires active interaction between humans and machines. User behavior induced by the operator’s decision-making process greatly impacts system operation and performance in such an environment that requires human-machine collaboration. There has been room for utilizing machine-generated data for a fine-grained understanding of the relationship between the behavior and performance of operators in the industrial domain, while multiple streams of data have been collected from manufacturing machines. In this study, we propose a large-scale data-analysis methodology that comprises data contextualization and performance modeling to understand the relationship between operator behavior and performance. For a case study, we collected machine-generated data over 6-months periods from a highly automated machine in a large tire manufacturing facility. We devised a set of metrics consisting of six human-machine interaction factors and four work environment factors as independent variables, and three performance factors as dependent variables. Our modeling results reveal that the performance variations can be explained by the interaction and work environment factors (R2 = 0.502, 0.356, and 0.500 for the three performance factors, respectively). Finally, we discuss future research directions for the realization of context-aware computing in semi-automated systems by leveraging machine-generated data as a new modality in human-machine collaboration.

When collaborating with artificial intelligence (AI), humans can often delegate tasks to leverage complementary AI competencies. However, humans often delegate inefficiently. Enabling humans with knowledge about AI can potentially improve inefficient AI delegation. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (two groups, n = 111) to examine how enabling humans with AI knowledge can improve AI delegation in human-AI collaboration. We find that AI knowledge-enabled humans align their delegation decisions more closely with their assessment of how suitable a task is for humans or AI (i.e., task appraisal). We show that delegation decisions closely aligned with task appraisal increase task performance. However, we also find that AI knowledge lowers future intentions to use AI, suggesting that AI knowledge is not strictly positive for human-AI collaboration. Our study contributes to HCI design guidelines with a new perspective on AI features, educating humans regarding general AI functioning and their own (human) performance and biases.

We conducted a field study with 13 participants with MCC, 3 caregivers, and 7 primary care providers in Washington State. Analysis of interviews with MCC participants showed that developing visualizations of connections between personal values, self-management tasks, and health conditions helped individuals make sense of connections relevant to their health and wellbeing, recognize a road map of central issues and their impacts, feel respected and understood, share priorities with providers, and support value-aligned changes.

 Engaging with multiple streams of personal health data to inform self-care of chronic health conditions remains a challenge. Existing informatics tools provide limited support for patients to make data actionable. To design better tools, we conducted two studies with Type 1 diabetes patients and their clinicians. In the first study, we observed data review sessions between patients and clinicians to articulate the tasks involved in assessing different types of data from diabetes devices to make care decisions. Drawing upon these tasks, we designed novel data interfaces called episode-driven data narratives and performed a task-driven evaluation. We found that as compared to the commercially available diabetes data reports, episode-driven data narratives improved engagement and decision-making with data. We discuss implications for designing data interfaces to support interaction with multidimensional health data to inform self-care.

 With nearly three billion players, video games are more popular than ever. Casual puzzle games are among the most played categories. These games capitalize on the players’ analytical and problem-solving skills. Can we leverage these abilities to teach ourselves how to solve complex combinatorial problems? In this study, we harness the collective wisdom of millions of players to tackle the classical NP-hard problem of multiple sequence alignment, relevant to many areas of biology and medicine. We show that Borderlands Science players propose solutions to multiple sequence alignment tasks that perform as well or better than standard approaches, while exploring a much larger area of the Pareto-optimal solution space. We also show the strategies of the players, although highly heterogeneous, follow a collective logic that can be mimicked with Behavioral Cloning with minimal performance loss, allowing the players’ collective wisdom to be leveraged for alignment of any sequences.

Shifting from Surveillance-as-Safety to Safety-through-Noticing: A Photovoice Study with Eastside Detroit Residents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581474,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581474,"
 Safety has been used to justify the expansion of today’s large-scale surveillance infrastructures in American cities. Our work offers empirical and theoretical groundings on why and how the safety-surveillance conflation that reproduces harm toward communities of color must be denaturalized. In a photovoice study conducted in collaboration with a Detroit community organization and a university team, we invited 11 Black mid-aged and senior Detroiters to use photography to capture their lived experiences of navigating personal and community safety. Their photographic narratives unveil acts of “everyday noticing” in negotiating and maintaining their intricate and interdependent relations with human, non-human animals, plants, spaces, and material things, through which a multiplicity of meaning and senses of safety are produced and achieved. Everyday noticing, as simultaneously a survival skill and a more-than-human care act, is situated in residents’ lived materialities, while also serving as a site for critiquing the reductive and exclusionary vision embedded in large-scale surveillance infrastructures. By proposing an epistemological shift from surveillance-as-safety to safety-through-noticing, we invite future HCI work to attend to the fluid and relational forms of safety that emerge from local entanglement and sensibilities.

Exploring Long-Term Mediated Relations with a Shape-Changing Thing: A Field Study of coMorphing Stool,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581140,1,,"
This paper presents a long-term field study of the coMorphing stool: a computational thing that can change shape in response to the surrounding light. We deployed 5 coMorphing stools to 5 participants' homes over 9 months. As co-speculators, the participants reflected on their mediated relations with the coMorphing stool. Findings suggest that they perceived the subtle transformations of the coMorphing stool in the early days of the deployment. After becoming familiar with these features, they interpreted their daily entanglements with the coMorphing stool in diverse personalized ways. Over time, the co-speculators accepted the coMorphing stool as part of their homes. These findings contribute new empirical insights to the shape-changing research field in HCI and enrich discussions on higher-level concepts in postphenomenology. Reflecting on these experiences promotes further HCI explorations on computational things.

 Most smart home devices have multiple sensors, such as cameras and microphones; however, most cannot be controlled individually. Tangible privacy mechanisms provide control over individual sensors and instill high certainty of privacy. Yet, it remains unclear how they can be used in future smart homes. We conducted three studies to understand how tangible privacy mechanisms scale across multiple devices and respond to user needs. First, we conducted a focus group (N=8) on speculative tangible control artifacts to understand the user perspective. Second, we ran a workshop at a human-computer interaction conference (N=8) on tangible privacy. Third, we conducted a six-week in-the-wild study with a tangible, static privacy dashboard across six households. Our findings help to contrast the need for tangible privacy mechanisms on the sensor level with user needs on a smart home level. Finally, we discuss our design implications for future smart homes through the lens of inclusive privacy.

Social stigma and human exceptionalism have contributed to unsustainable menstrual products and a neglect for the nutrients in menstrual blood that can enrich soil. In a Research-through-Design project, we explored how menstrual care can extend to caring for non-human species and the environment. We describe our design process and insights from three workshops with 20 participants, where we designed tools and technologies and worked with biomaterials to create biodegradable menstrual artifacts that can be composted and bring the nutrients in menstrual blood into soil. By drawing on feminist HCI’s quality of ecology and bringing more-than-human design into the domain of intimate care, our research affirms the fertile relations between feminist HCI and posthumanist HCI through the concept of more-than-human bodies. We discuss how our work contributes to inclusive understandings of technology, and to a feminist posthumanist design methodology that centers more-than-human bodies in intimate care.

 Teaching accessibility is essential in training technologists and designers. However, the topics of accessibility and disability are vast and intersect with culture (social constructions). Since cultural background is an influential factor in design decisions, which could have implications for accessible design, we wanted to understand whether and how courses at U.S. institutions address the importance of cultural influences when teaching accessibility and disability topics. We surveyed 72 students from U.S. institutions and ran 14 follow-up interviews with students who took technical and non-technical courses. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we found similarities and differences in how technical and non-technical courses approach accessibility teaching. We found a lack of cultural focus in accessibility teaching in the technical courses, which can be improved by adopting teaching approaches from non-technical courses. We also make recommendations to improve course design, such as including people from different cultures and disabilities to help develop courses.

Putting the Self in Self-Tracking: The Value of a Co-Designed 'How Might You'Self-Tracking Guide for Teenagers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580938,0,,"
Although teenagers engage with Personal Informatics tools to track their health and fitness, many do so without adequate guidance, and they express concerns regarding the potential for these practices to bring harm. Further research is needed to understand how we might leverage resources beyond these tools to support young self-trackers. We worked with 44 teenagers (aged 13-18 years) in the United Kingdom in two series of online workshops to co-design a reimagined ‘how might you’ guide to promote lifelong, healthy behaviors with self-tracking tools. Our findings emphasize the importance of flexible resources that can support teens’ self-tracking practices. For example, guidance on asking critical questions can be particularly valuable in the preparation and reflection stages of self-tracking. To better design teens’ interactions with health technologies, particularly Personal Informatics tools, we must think critically about how we design the broader information ecosystems within which these tools reside.

 Deceptive design patterns (known as dark patterns) are interface characteristics which modify users’ choice architecture to gain users’ attention, data, and money. Deceptive design patterns have yet to be documented in safety technologies despite evidence that designers of safety technologies make decisions that can powerfully influence user behavior. To address this gap, we conduct a case study of the Citizen app, a commercially available technology which notifies users about local safety incidents. We bound our study to Atlanta and triangulate interview data with an analysis of the user interface. Our results indicate that Citizen heightens users’ anxiety about safety while encouraging the use of profit-generating features which offer security. These findings contribute to an emerging conversation about how deceptive design patterns interact with sociocultural factors to produce deceptive infrastructure. We propose the need to expand an existing taxonomy of harm to include emotional load and social injustice and offer recommendations for designers interested in dismantling the deceptive infrastructure of safety technologies.

 YouTube has many features, such as homepage recommendations, that encourage users to explore its vast library of videos. However, when users visit YouTube with a specific intention, e.g., learning how to program in Python, these features to encourage exploration are often distracting. Prior work has innovated ‘commitment interfaces’ that restrict social media but finds that they often indiscriminately block needed content. In this paper, we describe the design, development, and evaluation of an ‘adaptable commitment interface,’ the SwitchTube mobile app, in which users can toggle between two interfaces when watching YouTube videos: Focus Mode (search-first) and Explore Mode (recommendations-first). In a three-week field deployment with 46 US participants, we evaluate how the ability to switch between interfaces affects user experience, finding that it provides users with a greater sense of agency, satisfaction, and goal alignment. We conclude with design implications for how adaptable commitment interfaces can support digital wellbeing.

On Hackathons: A Multidisciplinary Literature Review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581234,0,,"
 The number of hackathon events worldwide has nearly quadrupled in the last five years. Despite exponential growth across diverse industries and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena. We contribute a unifying framework with these four core areas to inform future directions of hackathon research and practice, as well as a discussion of the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research of hackathons.

 Billions of people use smartphones on a daily basis, including 15% of the world’s population with disabilities. Mobile platforms encourage developers to manually assess their apps’ accessibility in the way disabled users interact with phones, i.e., through Assistive Technologies (AT) like screen readers. However, most developers only test their apps with touch gestures and do not have enough knowledge to use AT properly. Moreover, automated accessibility testing tools typically do not consider AT. This paper introduces a record-and-replay technique that records the developers’ touch interactions, replays the same actions with an AT, and generates a visualized report of various ways of interacting with the app using ATs. Empirical evaluation of this technique on real-world apps revealed that while user study is the most reliable way of assessing accessibility, our technique can aid developers in detecting complex accessibility issues at different stages of development.

OPTIMISM: Enabling Collaborative Implementation of Domain Specific Metaheuristic Optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580904,0,,"
 For non-technical domain experts and designers it can be a substantial challenge to create designs that meet domain specific goals. This presents an opportunity to create specialized tools that produce optimized designs in the domain. However, implementing domain-specific optimization methods requires a rare combination of programming and domain expertise. Creating flexible design tools with re-configurable optimizers that can tackle a variety of problems in a domain requires even more domain and programming expertise. We present OPTIMISM, a toolkit which enables programmers and domain experts to collaboratively implement an optimization component of design tools. OPTIMISM supports the implementation of metaheuristic optimization methods by factoring them into easy to implement and reuse components: objectives that measure desirable qualities in the domain, modifiers which make useful changes to designs, design and modifier selectors which determine how the optimizer steps through the search space, and stopping criteria that determine when to return results. Implementing optimizers with OPTIMISM shifts the burden of domain expertise from programmers to domain experts.

 There is a growing interest in sustainable fabrication approaches, including the exploration of material conservation and utilisation of waste materials. Particularly, recent work has applied organic myco-materials, made from fungi, to develop tangible, interactive devices. However, a systematic approach for 3D fabrication using myco-materials is under-explored. In this paper, we present a parametric design tool and a fabrication pipeline to grow 3D designs using the mycelia of edible fungi species, such as Reishi or Oyster mushrooms. The proposed tool is designed based on empirical results from a series of technical evaluations of the geometric and material qualities of 3D-grown myco-objects. Furthermore, the paper introduces an easy-to-replicate fabrication process that can recycle different organic waste material combinations such as sawdust and coffee grounds to grow mycelia. Through a series of demonstration applications, we identify the challenges and opportunities for working with myco-materials in the HCI context.

Online platforms like YouTube and Instagram have enabled the platformization and monetization of creative work, allowing content creators to derive revenue and thrive in a creator economy. While much work has been done to understand content creation on single platforms, the creative practice often involves content creators’ agency and practice to interact with multiple platforms and make strategic decisions to optimize such interactions. In this paper, we use an interview study with 21 cross-platform creators to understand how they negotiate with platforms in their creative practices through the construction of creator ecology. We found that participants developed priorities among platforms based on varied criteria, paid attention to cross-platform content synchronization, and stressed managing and converting audiences across platforms to grow their fanbase. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between creator agency and labor, as well as yield implications for future design possibilities of creator empowerment and support.

 The proliferation of influencers on social-media platforms has drawn considerable research attention, particularly in the field of marketing. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding among HCI and communication researchers of what leads these social-media influencers’ (SMIs’) audiences to favor and choose their content over traditional media. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 45 SMI audience members. Our findings revealed a total of eight categories of SMIs’ appeals, i.e., factors that made the interviewees favor their content over traditional media. These appeals can further be grouped into three categories: content, presentation, and closeness. In particular, we identified the key role of SMIs’ perceived high autonomy and independence, which led both their content and their presentation styles to be seen as distinct from and more appealing than traditional media. Likewise, four closeness appeals made our participants feel emotionally attached to SMIs, resulting in sustained engagement.

The Intricacies of Social Robots: Secondary Analysis of Fictional Documentaries to Explore the Benefits and Challenges of Robots in Complex Social Settings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581526,1,,"
In the design of social robots, the focus is often on the robot itself rather than on the intricacies of possible application scenarios. In this paper, we examine eight fictional documentaries about social robots, such as SEYNO, a robot that promotes respect between passengers in trains, or PATO, a robot to watch movies with. Overall, robots were conceptualized either (1) to substitute humans in relationships or (2) to mediate relationships (human-human-robot-interaction). While the former is basis of many current approaches to social robotics, the latter is less common, but particularly interesting. For instance, the mediation perspective fundamentally impacts the role a robot takes (e.g., role model, black sheep, ally, opponent, moralizer) and thus its potential function and form. From the substitution perspective, robots are expected to mimic human emotions; from the mediation perspective, robots can be positive precisely because they remain objective and are neither emotional nor empathic.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is envisioned to make ML techniques accessible to ordinary users. Recent work has investigated the role of humans in enhancing AutoML functionality throughout a standard ML workflow. However, it is also critical to understand how users adopt existing AutoML solutions in complex, real-world settings from a holistic perspective. To fill this gap, this study conducted semi-structured interviews of AutoML users (N = 19) focusing on understanding (1) the limitations of AutoML encountered by users in their real-world practices, (2) the strategies users adopt to cope with such limitations, and (3) how the limitations and workarounds impact their use of AutoML. Our findings reveal that users actively exercise user agency to overcome three major challenges arising from customizability, transparency, and privacy. Furthermore, users make cautious decisions about whether and how to apply AutoML on a case-by-case basis. Finally, we derive design implications for developing future AutoML solutions.

 Emerging methods for participatory algorithm design have proposed collecting and aggregating individual stakeholders’ preferences to create algorithmic systems that account for those stakeholders’ values. Drawing on two years of research across two public school districts in the United States, we study how families and school districts use students’ preferences for schools to meet their goals in the context of algorithmic student assignment systems. We find that the design of the preference language, i.e. the structure in which participants must express their needs and goals to the decision-maker, shapes the opportunities for meaningful participation. We define three properties of preference languages – expressiveness, cost, and collectivism – and discuss how these factors shape who is able to participate, and the extent to which they are able to effectively communicate their needs to the decision-maker. Reflecting on these findings, we offer implications and paths forward for researchers and practitioners who are considering applying a preference-based model for participation in algorithmic decision making.

 Scientists often use meta-analysis to characterize the impact of an intervention on some outcome of interest across a body of literature. However, threats to the utility and validity of meta-analytic estimates arise when scientists average over potentially important variations in context like different research designs. Uncertainty about quality and commensurability of evidence casts doubt on results from meta-analysis, yet existing software tools for meta-analysis do not provide an explicit software representation of these concerns. We present MetaExplorer, a prototype system for meta-analysis that we developed using iterative design with meta-analysis experts to provide a guided process for eliciting assessments of uncertainty and reasoning about how to incorporate them during statistical inference. Our qualitative evaluation of MetaExplorer with experienced meta-analysts shows that imposing a structured workflow both elevates the perceived importance of epistemic concerns and presents opportunities for tools to engage users in dialogue around goals and standards for evidence aggregation.

 Faith institutions provide social support and community care for many in the United States (U.S.). Notably, churches with predominantly Black populations have served as a site for social change and care provision, historically and in contemporary society. However, the pandemic has emphasised how localising these care networks in physical spaces can limit access to social support. Information and communication technologies offer opportunities for expanding access to care in these communities. However, integrating care networks into online contexts remains a challenge for many churches, and the potential for technology to expand these networks is not well understood. Through interviews and focus groups with nine church members, we explore how hybrid faith communities that bridge offline and online contexts can enable social support and care provision. Our findings highlight care network structures in Black churches, barriers to embedding these networks online and strategies for building more seamless hybrid support systems.

Sensorimotor Simulation of Redirected Reaching using Stochastic Optimal Feedback Control,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580767,0,,"
Illusory VR interaction techniques such as hand redirection work because humans use vision to adjust their motor commands during movement (e.g., reaching). Existing simulations of redirected reaching are limited, however, and have not yet incorporated important stochastic characteristics like sensorimotor noise, nor captured redirection’s effect on movement duration. In this work, we propose adapting a stochastic optimal feedback control (SOFC) model of normal reach to simulate redirection by augmenting sensory feedback at run-time. We present a summary of our simulation and validate it against user data gathered in multiple redirection conditions. We also evaluate the impacts of visual attention on the effectiveness of redirection in real users and replicate the effects in simulation. Our results show that an infinite-horizon SOFC model is able to reproduce key characteristics of redirected reaches and highlight the benefits of SOFC as a tool for simulating, evaluating, and gaining insights about redirection techniques.

However, little is known about how under-resourced populations decide to make new connections online and under what circumstances. We interviewed 36 low-income individuals to understand these decisions and found that people make new connections in order to seek advice and exchange support, particularly around coping with challenges more prevalent in under-resourced settings. However, participants were sometimes dissuaded from making new connections online due to fear of being scammed and hesitance around the social norms of reaching out to people outside their network. We discuss how people in under-resourced contexts grapple with ‘high risk yet high reward’ social networking and outline implications for supporting safe and purposeful network development among under-resourced SNS users.

A World Full of Privacy and Security (Mis) conceptions? Findings of a Representative Survey in 12 Countries,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581410,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581410,"
 Misconceptions about digital security and privacy topics in the general public frequently lead to insecure behavior. However, little is known about the prevalence and extent of such misconceptions in a global context. In this work, we present the results of the first large-scale survey of a global population on misconceptions: We conducted an online survey with n = 12, 351 participants in 12 countries on four continents. By investigating influencing factors of misconceptions around eight common security and privacy topics (including E2EE, Wi-Fi, VPN, and malware), we find the country of residence to be the strongest estimate for holding misconceptions. We also identify differences between non-Western and Western countries, demonstrating the need for region-specific research on user security knowledge, perceptions, and behavior. While we did not observe many outright misconceptions, we did identify a lack of understanding and uncertainty about several fundamental privacy and security topics.

Understanding the Online Social Support Dynamics for Postpartum Depression,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581311,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581311,"
 Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most prevalent mental health disorder following childbirth. Mothers utilize social media and online forums throughout postpartum to seek mental health support. In this paper, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics of naturally occurring online discussions and the online social support dynamics associated with PPD. We qualitatively analyze posts and comments from three postpartum depression support communities corresponding to well-known online social platforms (Reddit, What to expect, and Babycenter). We discovered that the three communities share common themes of discussion that include the causes, stressors, symptoms, and coping mechanisms for PPD. Seeking both informational and emotional support through venting and storytelling was prevalent, and emotional support seeking was more common in Reddit than the other two communities. We provide recommendations for future postpartum depression research and design considerations based on pervasive help-seeking approaches.

4Doodle: 4D Printing Artifacts Without 3D Printers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581321,0,,"
4D printing encodes transformability over time, which empowers users to create artifacts by on-demand deformation. The creative process of 4D printing shape-changing artifacts can be challenging because of its discontinuous fabrication steps, such as digital designing, specific path planning, automatic printing and manual triggering. We hypothesize that switching from typical 4D printing reliant on 3D printers to a more “handcrafted” method can allow users to understand and continuously reflect upon the artifact and its transformability. Towards this vision, we introduce 4Doodle, a hybrid craft approach that integrates unique deformation controllability and five techniques for freehand 4D printing, using a 3D pen. To tackle the shape-changing challenges of uncertain hands-on fabrication, we develop a mixed reality system to help novices master the manual skills of 4D printing. We also demonstrate a series of 4D printed artifacts with fully human intervention. Finally, our user study shows that 4Doodle lowers the skill-acquisition barrier associated with handcrafting 4D printed artifacts, and it has great potential for creative production and spatial ability.

How language formality in security and privacy interfaces impacts intended compliance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581275,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581275,"
 Strong end-user security practices benefit both the user and hosting platform, but it is not well understood how companies communicate with their users to encourage these practices. This paper explores whether web companies and their platforms use different levels of language formality in these communications and tests the hypothesis that higher language formality leads to users’ increased intention to comply. We contribute a dataset and systematic analysis of 1,817 English language strings in web security and privacy interfaces across 13 web platforms, showing strong variations in language. An online study with 512 participants further demonstrated that people perceive differences in the language formality across platforms and that a higher language formality is associated with higher self-reported intention to comply. Our findings suggest that formality can be an important factor in designing effective security and privacy prompts. We discuss implications of these results, including how to balance formality with platform language style. In addition to being the first piece of work to analyze language formality in user security, these findings provide valuable insights into how platforms can best communicate with users about account security.

 People nowadays can use multiple devices to interact with notifications, whether via noticing, glancing, reading, or acting upon them. Prior research has focused on actual usage or on device preferences. However, users’ ideal experience of cross-device notification-interaction might differ from their current practices (due to situational limitations) and/or across the four notification-interaction stages. We therefore conducted an experience-sampling method study with multi-device users to investigate these gaps and the influence of device context. Our results reveal that nearly half of the time, the non-phone devices the participants had ranked as their top preferences for notification-interaction were not actually used, due to the devices’ context. Beyond device context, the participants’ choices of devices for notification-interaction were heavily determined by 1) their preferences that particular notification-interaction stages to take place (or not) on particular devices; and 2) the device on which they had undertaken the former stage.

Online Harassment in Majority Contexts: Examining Harms and Remedies across Countries,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581020,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11715,"
Online harassment is a global problem. This article examines perceptions of harm and preferences for remedies associated with online harassment with nearly 4000 participants in 14 countries around the world. The countries in this work reflect a range of identities and values, with a focus on those outside of North American and European contexts. Results show that perceptions of harm are higher among participants from all countries studied compared to the United States. Non-consensual sharing of sexual photos is consistently rated as harmful in all countries, while insults and rumors are perceived as more harmful in non-U.S. countries, especially harm to family reputation. Lower trust in other people and lower trust in sense of safety in one’s neighborhood correlate with increased perceptions of harm of online harassment. In terms of remedies, participants in most countries prefer monetary compensation, apologies, and publicly revealing offender’s identities compared to the U.S. Social media platform design and policy must consider regional values and norms, which may depart from U.S. centric-approaches.

 The Human-computer Interaction (HCI) community has the opportunity to foster the integration of research practices across the Global South and North to begin overcoming colonial relationships. In this paper, we focus on the case of Latin America (LATAM), where initiatives to increase the representation of HCI practitioners lack a consolidated understanding of the practices they employ, the factors that influence them, and the challenges that practitioners face. To address this knowledge gap, we employ a mixed-methods approach, comprising a survey (66 respondents) and in-depth interviews (19 interviewees). Our analyses characterize a set of research perspectives on how HCI is practiced in/about LATAM; a set of driving forces and tensions with a heavy reliance on diasporic dynamics; and a set of professional demands and associated structural limitations. We also offer a roadmap towards building connections across HCI communities, in an attempt to rebuild HCI as a pluriverse.

Using Patient-Generated Data to Support Cardiac Rehabilitation and the Transition to Self-Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580822,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580822,"
Patient-generated data from commercially available self-tracking devices has the potential to enhance support for people transitioning from hospitalization to self-care. However, studies have revealed significant barriers to the routine use of such data in clinical settings. This paper explores the use of patient-generated data in the context of cardiac rehabilitation. We describe a two-stage investigation: (1) a co-design study with clinicians to design a data system that combines objective and subjective patient data; and (2) an 18-week field-study where this system was deployed as part of a hospital-based rehabilitation program. Our findings suggest the system is feasible, supported clinicians’ workflow, and helped patients to bridge the gap between supervised and self-managed care. Subjective data contextualized objective data and a structured approach data collection helped generate actionable information. The paper also provides insight on patients' attitudes towards peer data sharing and demonstrates the importance of timing when introducing self-tracking technology.

Selecting Real-World Objects via User-Perspective Phone Occlusion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580696,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580696,"
Perceiving the region of interest (ROI) and target object by smartphones from the user’s first-person perspective can enable diverse spatial interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel ROI input method and a target selecting method for smartphones by utilizing the user-perspective phone occlusion. This concept of turning the phone into real-world physical cursor benefits from the proprioception, gets rid of the constraint of camera preview, and allows users to rapidly and accurately select the target object. Meanwhile, our method can provide a resizable and rotatable rectangular ROI to disambiguate dense targets. We implemented the prototype system by positioning the user’s iris with the front camera and estimating the rectangular area blocked by the phone with the rear camera simultaneously, followed by a target prediction algorithm with the distance-weighted Jaccard index. We analyzed the behavioral models of using our method and evaluated our prototype system’s pointing accuracy and usability. Results showed that our method is well-accepted by the users for its convenience, accuracy, and efficiency.

Although a great deal of research has examined interventions to help users protect their own information online, less work has examined methods for reducing interdependent privacy (IDP) violations on social media (i.e., sharing of other people's information). This study tested the effectiveness of concept-based (i.e., general information), fact-based (i.e., statistics), and narrative-based (i.e., stories) educational videos in altering IDP-relevant attitudes and multimedia sharing behaviors. Our study revealed concept and fact videos reduced sharing of social media content that portrayed people negatively. The narrative intervention backfired and increased sharing among participants who did not believe IDP violations to be especially serious; however, the narrative intervention decreased sharing for participants who rated IDP violations as more serious. Notably, our study found participants preferred narrative-based interventions with real world examples, despite other strategies more effectively reducing sharing. Implications for narrative transportation theory and advancing bottom-up (i.e., user-centered) psychosocial interventions are discussed.

 Dying is a universal experience that entails uncertainty, loss, and termination. Often, people face death unprepared and miss out on opportunities to shape their final stage of life as well as their afterlife. To better understand how thanato-technology can support the dying and the bereaved, we performed a scoping review on the current state-of-art in Human Computer Interaction. Following the PRISMA-ScR procedure, we gathered and analyzed 107 relevant papers. We categorized theoretical and conceptual contributions into three overarching themes: digital remains, remembrance, and coping. We further highlight 18 practices, such as curation, honoring and letting go. We show that technology can help to capture the identity of the deceased, to validate the life lived, and to come to terms with death. However, available approaches focus more on the bereaved than on the dying. In addition, potentially important aspects of dying (e.g., balancing involvement and autonomy, spiritual meaning-making) remain largely unexplored.

With improvements in automated speech recognition and increased use of videoconferencing, real-time captioning has changed significantly. This shift toward broadly available but less accurate captioning invites exploration of the role hearing conversation partners play in shaping the accessibility of a conversation to d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) captioning users. While recent work has explored DHH individuals’ videoconferencing experiences with captioning, we focus on established groups’ current practices and priorities for future tools to support more accessible online conversations. Our study consists of three codesign sessions, conducted with four groups (17 participants total, 10 DHH, 7 hearing). We found that established groups crafted social accessibility norms that met their relational contexts. We also identify promising directions for future captioning design, including the need to standardize speaker identification and customization, opportunities to provide behavioral feedback during a conversation, and ways that videoconferencing platforms could enable groups to set and share norms.

Motion sickness is a problem for many in everyday travel and will become more prevalent with the rise of automated vehicles. Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have shown significant promise in-transit, enabling passengers to engage in immersive entertainment and productivity experiences. In a controlled multi-session motion sickness study using an actuated rotating chair, we examine the potential of multi-sensory visual and auditory motion cues, presented during a VR reading task, for mitigating motion sickness. We found that visual cues are most efficient in reducing symptoms, with auditory cues showing some beneficial effects when combined with the visual. Motion sickness had negative effects on presence as well as task performance, and despite the cognitive demand and multi-sensory cues, motion sickness still reached problematic levels. Our work emphasises the need for effective mitigations and the design of stronger multi-sensory motion cues if VR is to fulfil its potential for passengers.

 Researchers invested enormous efforts to understand and mitigate the concerns of users as technologies collect their private data. However, users often undermine other people’s privacy when, e.g., posting other people’s photos online, granting mobile applications to access contacts, or using technologies that continuously sense the surrounding. Research to understand technology adoption and behaviors related to collecting and sharing data about non-users has been severely lacking. An essential step to progress in this direction is to identify and quantify factors that affect technology’s use. Toward this goal, we propose and validate a psychometric scale to measure how much an individual values other people’s privacy. We theoretically grounded the appropriateness and relevance of the construct and empirically demonstrated the scale’s internal consistency and validity. This scale will advance the field by enabling researchers to predict behaviors, design adaptive privacy-enhancing technologies, and develop interventions to raise awareness and mitigate privacy risks.

 As more people rely on visualization to inform their personal and collective decisions, researchers have focused on a broader range of audiences, including “novices.” But successfully applying, interrogating, or advancing visualization research for novices demands a clear understanding of what “novice” means in theory and practice. Misinterpreting who a “novice” is could lead to misapplying guidelines and overgeneralizing results. In this paper, we investigated how visualization researchers define novices and how they evaluate visualizations intended for novices. We analyzed 79 visualization papers that used “novice,” “non-expert,” “laypeople,” or “general public” in their titles or abstracts. We found ambiguity within papers and disagreement between papers regarding what defines a novice. Furthermore, we found a mismatch between the broad language describing novices and the narrow population representing them in evaluations (i.e., young people, students, and US residents). We suggest directions for inclusively supporting novices in both theory and practice.

Video broadcasting and online video platforms make watching basketball games increasingly accessible. Yet, for new or casual fans, watching basketball videos is often confusing due to their limited basketball knowledge and the lack of accessible, on-demand information to resolve their confusion. To assist casual fans in watching basketball videos, we compared the game-watching behaviors of casual and die-hard fans in a formative study and developed iBall based on the findings. iBall embeds visualizations into basketball videos using a computer vision pipeline, and automatically adapts the visualizations based on the game context and users’ gaze, helping casual fans appreciate basketball games without being overwhelmed. We confirmed the usefulness, usability, and engagement of iBall in a study with 16 casual fans, and further collected feedback from 8 die-hard fans.

 Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Block-based programming environments address these challenges through symbolic graphical interfaces, but users often need instructor support to advance. Alternatively, voice-based tools provide direct instruction on CT concepts but can present memory and navigation challenges to users. In this work, we present Visual StoryCoder, a multimodal tablet application that combines the strengths of each of these approaches to overcome their respective weaknesses. Visual StoryCoder introduces children ages 5–8 to CT through creative storytelling, offers direct instruction via a pedagogical voice agent, and eases use through a block-like graphical interface. In a between-subjects evaluation comparing Visual StoryCoder to a leading block-based programming app for this age group (N = 24), we show that Visual StoryCoder is more understandable to independent learners, leads to higher-quality code after app familiarization, and encourages personally meaningful projects.

Despite the proliferation of research on how people engage with and experience algorithmic systems, the materiality and physicality of these experiences is often overlooked. We tend to forget about bodies. The Embodying the Algorithm1 project worked with artists to explore the experience of translating algorithmically produced performance instructions through human bodies. As performers interpreted the rules of engagement produced by GPT-3, they struggled with the lack of consideration the rules showed for the limits of the human body. Performers made sense of their experience through personification, reflexivity, and interpretation, which gave rise to three modes of relating with the algorithm – agonistic, perfunctory, and agreeable. We demonstrate that collaboration with algorithmic systems is ultimately impossible as people can only relate to algorithmic systems (a one-way relation) due to the material limitations of algorithmic systems for reciprocity, understanding, and consideration for the human body.

We describe a study exploring interactions and preferences among co-located individuals using a dynamic data-physicalization in the form of a shape-changing bar chart, and compare this to previous work with single participants. Results suggest that co-located interactions with physical data prompt non-interactive hand gestures, a mirroring of physicalizations, and novel hand gestures in comparison to single participant studies. We also note that behavioural similarities in participants between interactive tabletop studies and data-physicalizations may be capitalised upon for further development of these dynamic representations. Finally, we consider the implications and challenges for the adoption of these types of platforms.

We further employed a two-stage clustering approach to separate users into four groups according to the patterns of their phone-usage behaviors, and then built a fusion model for each group. The performance of the four models, though diverse, yielded better average precision of 0.87 and AUROC of 0.76, and was superior to that of the general/unified model shared among all users. We investigated and discussed the features of the four time-killing behavior clusters that explain why the models’ performance differ.

 As more and more virtual reality (VR) headsets support eye tracking, recent techniques started to use eye blinks to induce unnoticeable manipulations to the virtual environment, e.g., to redirect users’ actions. However, to exploit their full potential, more control over users’ blinking behavior in VR is required. To this end, we propose a set of reflex-based blink triggers that are suited specifically for VR. In accordance with blink-based techniques for redirection, we formulate (i) effectiveness, (ii) efficiency, (iii) reliability, and (iv) unobtrusiveness as central requirements for successful triggers. We implement the soft- and hardware-based methods and compare the four most promising approaches in a user study. Our results highlight the pros and cons of the tested triggers, and show those based on the menace, corneal, and dazzle reflexes to perform best. From these results, we derive recommendations that help choosing suitable blink triggers for VR applications.

Thematic analysis of discussions and activity artifacts from a summer camp and after-school session revealed a number of findings around how Black girls: perceive AI, primarily consider fairness as niceness and equality (but may need support considering other notions, such as equity), consider accountability, and envision a just future. We also discuss how the learners can be positioned as decision-making designers in creating AI technology, as well as how AI literacy learning experiences can be empowering.

Metrics for Peer Counseling: Triangulating Success Outcomes for Online Therapy Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581372,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581372,"
 Extensive research has been published on the conversational factors of effective volunteer peer counseling on online mental health platforms (OMHPs). However, studies differ in how they define and measure success outcomes, with most prior work examining only a single success metric. In this work, we model the relationship between previously reported linguistic predictors of effective counseling with four outcomes following a peer-to-peer session on a single OMHP: retention in the community, following up on a previous session with a counselor, users’ evaluation of a counselor, and changes in users’ mood. Results show that predictors correlate negatively with community retention but positively with users following up with and giving higher evaluations to individual counselors. We suggest actionable insights for therapy platform design and outcome measurement based on findings that the relationship between predictors and outcomes of successful conversations depends on differences in measurement construct and operationalization.

ARound the Smartphone: Investigating the Effects of Virtually-Extended Display Size on Spatial Memory,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581438,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581438,"
 Smartphones conveniently place large information spaces in the palms of our hands. While research has shown that larger screens positively affect spatial memory, workload, and user experience, smartphones remain fairly compact for the sake of device ergonomics and portability. Thus, we investigate the use of hybrid user interfaces to virtually increase the available display size by complementing the smartphone with an augmented reality head-worn display. We thereby combine the benefits of familiar touch interaction with the near-infinite visual display space afforded by augmented reality. To better understand the potential of virtually-extended displays and the possible issues of splitting the user’s visual attention between two screens (real and virtual), we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 24 participants completing navigation tasks using different virtually-augmented display sizes. Our findings reveal that a desktop monitor size represents a “sweet spot” for extending smartphones with augmented reality, informing the design of hybrid user interfaces.

 Although fluidic computation has been utilized to develop interactive devices in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the limited computation complexity of previous work hinders the exploration of richer interaction modalities. Based on the Fluidic Computation Kit we developed, this paper explores how unconventional mechanical computing can be leveraged to design shape-changing interfaces that integrate input sensing, output, and complex computation. After introducing the design space enabled by the Kit, we explain how to design four types of elementary computational components and six categories of operators. We end by providing several application scenarios which illustrate the Fluidic Computation Kit’s potential to build sophisticated circuits (e.g., a parallel processor) for use in the field of HCI.

 Outdoor learning experiences, such as field trips, can improve children’s science achievement and engagement, but these experiences are often difficult to deliver without extensive support. Narrative in educational experiences can provide needed structure, while also increasing engagement. We created a narrative-based, mobile application to investigate how to guide young learners in interacting with their local, outdoor environment. In a second variant, we added augmented reality and image classification to explore the value of these features. A study (n = 44) found that participants using our system demonstrated learning gains and found the experience engaging. Our findings identified several major themes, including participant excitement for hands-on interactions with nature, curiosity about the characters, and enthusiasm toward typing their thoughts and observations. We offer a set of design implications for supporting narrative-based, outdoor learning with immersive technology.

 We report on a qualitative study in which 22 participants created Augmented Reality (AR) stories for outdoor cultural heritage sites. As storytelling is a crucial strategy for AR content aimed at providing meaningful experiences, the emphasis has been on what storytelling does, rather than how it is done, the end user’s needs prioritized over the author’s. To address this imbalance, we identify how recurring patterns in the spatial trajectories and narrative compositions of AR stories for cultural heritage sites are linked to the author’s intent and creative process: While authors tend to bind story arcs tightly to confined trajectories for narrative delivery, the need for spatial exploration results in thematic content mapped loosely onto encompassing trajectories. Based on our analysis, we present design recommendations for site-specific AR storytelling tools that can support authors in delivering their intent while leveraging the placeness of cultural heritage sites as a creative resource.

Augmenting On-Body Touch Input with Tactile Feedback Through Fingernail Haptics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581473,0,,"
 The key assumption attributed to on-body touch input is that the skin being touched provides natural tactile feedback. In this paper, we for the first time systematically explore augmenting on-body touch input with computer-generated tactile feedback. We employ vibrotactile actuation on the fingernail to couple on-body touch input with tactile feedback. Results from our first experiment show that users prefer tactile feedback for on-body touch input. In our second experiment, we determine the frequency thresholds for rendering realistic tactile “click” sensations for on-body touch buttons on three different body locations. Finally, in our third experiment, we dig deeper to render highly expressive tactile effects with a single actuator. Our non-metric multi-dimensional analysis shows that haptic augmentation of on-body buttons enhances the expressivity of on-body touch input. Overall, results from our experiments reinforce the need for tactile feedback for on-body touch input and show that actuation on the fingernail is a promising approach.

 Large-scale shape-changing interfaces (SCIs) such as shape-changing walls offer opportunities for enhancing user experiences within buildings, e.g., for navigation. However, due to the embryonic nature of SCI technologies, designing and explaining the shape features that are beneficial to users is challenging. Previous work used virtual platforms (2D video or Projected Augmented Reality) to design SCI. This paper explores how Virtual Reality (VR) can provide an immersive experience that can help in designing large-scale SCI. We follow a co-design approach in which we use VR to obtain users’ impressions of shape-changing walls. Then, we conduct co-design sessions to understand how shape-changing walls can be designed to become ambient and blend with the environment. We report our results to guide the design of shape-changing walls as well as discuss how our approach can provide valuable insights into how a VR experience, prior to design, and can help in the design process.

Unmaking as Emancipation: Lessons and Reflections from Luddism,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581412,1,,"
 Emancipation is fundamentally a work of unmaking, as it entails undermining, dissolving, and undoing oppressive structures. This paper offers an account of a frequently misunderstood unmaking movement, Luddism. The Luddites were a loosely organized collective of nineteenth century English textile makers who destroyed machines that were replacing their skilled labor and leading to deteriorating working conditions. In this account, we show that the goals and tactics of Luddism have significant alignments with current HCI work in the areas of unmaking and social justice. Through articulation of six characteristics of unmaking in Luddism - practical and symbolic, community-engaged, emancipatory, selective, antagonistic, and enduring - we identify potential limits and opportunities in HCI research and design practice, as currently construed. In doing so, we build upon and extend prior HCI research to suggest unmaking as emancipation, a new category of unmaking around issues of social justice.

 Speechreading is the art of using visual and contextual cues in the environment to support listening. Often used by d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (d/DHH) individuals, it highlights nuances of rich communication. However, lived experiences of speechreaders are underdocumented in HCI literature, and the impact of online environments and interactions of captioning with speechreading has not been explored in depth. We bridge these gaps through a three-part study consisting of formative interviews, design probes, and design sessions with 12 d/DHH individuals who speechread. Our primary contribution is to understand the lived experience of speechreading in online communication, and thus to better understand the richness and variety of techniques d/DHH individuals use to provision access. We highlight technical, environmental and sociocultural factors that impact communication accessibility, explore the design space of speechreading supports and share considerations for the design future of speechreading technology.

HotFoot: Foot-Based User Identification Using Thermal Imaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580924,0,http://florian-alt.org/unibw/wp-content/publications/saad2023chi.pdf,"
 We propose a novel method for seamlessly identifying users by combining thermal and visible feet features. While it is known that users’ feet have unique characteristics, these have so far been underutilized for biometric identification, as observing those features often requires the removal of shoes and socks. As thermal cameras are becoming ubiquitous, we foresee a new form of identification, using feet features and heat traces to reconstruct the footprint even while wearing shoes or socks. We collected a dataset of users’ feet (N = 21), wearing three types of footwear (personal shoes, standard shoes, and socks) on three floor types (carpet, laminate, and linoleum). By combining visual and thermal features, an AUC between 91.1% and 98.9%, depending on floor type and shoe type can be achieved, with personal shoes on linoleum floor performing best. Our findings demonstrate the potential of thermal imaging for continuous and unobtrusive user identification.

Towards Applied Remapped Physical-Virtual Interfaces: Synchronization Methods for Resolving Control State Conflicts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580723,0,,"
 User interfaces in virtual reality enable diverse interactions within the virtual world, though they typically lack the haptic cues provided by physical interface controls. Haptic retargeting enables flexible mapping between dynamic virtual interfaces and physical controls to provide real haptic feedback. This investigation aims to extend these remapped interfaces to support more diverse control types. Many interfaces incorporate sliders, switches, and knobs. These controls hold fixed states between interactions creating potential conflicts where a virtual control has a different state from the physical control. This paper presents two methods, “manual” and “automatic”, for synchronizing physical and virtual control states and explores the effects of these methods on the usability of remapped interfaces. Results showed that interfaces without retargeting were the ideal configuration, but they lack the flexibility that remapped interfaces provide. Automatic synchronization was faster and more usable; however, manual synchronization is suitable for a broader range of physical interfaces.

We develop an integrated AR-device and an integrated vision-based detection pipeline that can track 3D edges and detect the touch interaction between fingers and edges. Leveraging the spatial-awareness of AR, users can simply select an edge by sliding fingers along it and then make the edge interactive by connecting it to various digital functions. We demonstrate four use cases including multi-function controllers, smart homes, games, and TUI-based tutorials. We also evaluated and proved our system’s usability through a two-session user study, where qualitative and quantitative results are positive.

This project uses research through design to explore how metadata could be used as a design material to create inheritable artefacts that make personal legacy experiential. Metadata is produced as traces of life, and by designing artifacts that capture and represent these traces, interaction design offers the possibility to experience the everyday practices of someone else as they are passed on and inherited. We use interviews with people interested in data practices, memorializing, and who have experienced grief to find themes and insights for designing with metadata as well as for legacy. Based on these, we developed the prototype Anekdota, a handheld metadata detector that lets an inheritor experience bequeathed location metadata. From a series of think-aloud walks, Anekdota was tested with participants to reveal sensitizing concepts for designing for metadata, and imaginative leaps for how this metadata may become a part of future legacy practices.

 When emerging adults move out of their parents’ homes for the first time, their needs for togetherness and connection evolve, as do their parents’. In co-located homes, people often experience togetherness passively by sensing one another’s presence in their environment. However, when no longer living together, methods of experiencing togetherness change. Thus, we conducted an interview and co-design study with 16 pairs of parents and emerging adults that explores this concept across distance. The study uncovered differences in the connection needs of emerging adults and their parents, including their goals in connecting, the amount of communication they needed, and their needs for privacy and transparency. We additionally found that passive connecting factors included ambient sounds of the home, visual shared experiences and traces of one another in the home, ambient home smellscapes and smell memories, touching left-behind objects or gifted objects, and the taste of family recipes and the ambience of family mealtimes. We discuss suggestions for designing for passive co-presence based on this new knowledge.

Human memory has notable limitations (e.g., forgetting) which have necessitated a variety of memory aids (e.g., calendars). As we grow closer to mass adoption of everyday Extended Reality (XR), which is frequently leveraging perceptual limitations (e.g., redirected walking), it becomes pertinent to consider how XR could leverage memory limitations (forgetting, distorting, persistence) to induce memory manipulations. As memories highly impact our self-perception, social interactions, and behaviors, there is a pressing need to understand XR Memory Manipulations (XRMMs). We ran three speculative design workshops (n=12), with XR and memory researchers creating 48 XRMM scenarios. Through thematic analysis, we define XRMMs, present a framework of their core components and reveal three classes (at encoding, pre-retrieval, at retrieval). Each class differs in terms of technology (AR, VR) and impact on memory (influencing quality of memories, inducing forgetting, distorting memories). We raise ethical concerns and discuss opportunities of perceptual and memory manipulations in XR.

 Interacting with strangers can be beneficial but also challenging. Fortunately, these challenges can lead to design opportunities.

SocialStools is an installation of three responsive stools on caster wheels that generate sound and imagery in the near environment as three strangers sit on them, move them, and rotate them relative to each other. In our study with 12 groups of three strangers, we found a sense of togetherness emerged through interaction, evidenced by different patterns of socio-spatial movements, verbal communication, non-verbal behavior, and interview responses. We present our findings, articulate reasons for the cultivation of togetherness, consider the unique social affordances of our spatial interface in shifting attention during interpersonal communication, and provide design implications.

 Tasks that involve locating objects and then moving hands to those specific locations, such as using touchscreens or grabbing objects on a desk, are challenging for the visually impaired. Over the years, audio guidance and haptic feedback have been a staple in hand navigation based assistive technologies.

In this paper, we present automated hand-based spatial guidance to bridge the gap between guidance and execution, allowing visually impaired users to move their hands between two points automatically, without any manual effort. We implement this concept through FingerRover, an on-finger miniature robot that carries the user’s finger to target points. We demonstrate the potential applications that can benefit from automated hand-based spatial guidance. Our user study shows the potential of our technique in improving the interaction capabilities of people with visual impairments.

In an in-the-wild study, participant interviews revealed three UX themes (closed-loop neurocentric agency, awareness of hardware, and awareness of feedback), which ultimately suggested that participants fell asleep in spite of Dozer, rather than through its assistance. We interpret these results and provide actionable design tactics to inform the design of closed-loop sleep systems moving forward. We hope this work gives rise to a deeper understanding of designing closed techno-physiological loops.

Improving Automatic Summarization for Browsing Longform Spoken Dialog,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581339,0,,"
 Longform spoken dialog delivers rich streams of informative content through podcasts, interviews, debates, and meetings. While production of this medium has grown tremendously, spoken dialog remains challenging to consume as listening is slower than reading and difficult to skim or navigate relative to text. Recent systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic summarization allow users to better browse speech data and forage for information of interest. However, these systems intake disfluent speech which causes automatic summarization to yield readability, adequacy, and accuracy problems. To improve navigability and browsability of speech, we present three training agnostic post-processing techniques that address dialog concerns of readability, coherence, and adequacy. We integrate these improvements with user interfaces which communicate estimated summary metrics to aid user browsing heuristics. Quantitative evaluation metrics show a 19% improvement in summary quality. We discuss how summarization technologies can help people browse longform audio in trustworthy and readable ways.

 Digital artboards, which hold objects rather than pixels (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides), remain largely inaccessible for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. Building on prior findings about the experiences of BLV users with digital artboards, we present a novel tool called A11yBoard, an interactive multimodal system that makes interpreting and authoring digital artboards accessible. A11yBoard combines a web-based drawing canvas paired with a mobile touch screen device such as a tablet. The mobile device displays the same canvas and enables risk-free spatial exploration of the artboard via touch and gesture. Speech recognition, non-speech audio, and keyboard-based commands are also used for input and output.

WordGesture-GAN: Modeling Word-Gesture Movement with Generative Adversarial Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581279,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581279,"
Word-gesture production models that can synthesize word-gestures are critical to the training and evaluation of word-gesture keyboard decoders. We propose WordGesture-GAN, a conditional generative adversarial network that takes arbitrary text as input to generate realistic word-gesture movements in both spatial (i.e., (x, y) coordinates of touch points) and temporal (i.e., timestamps of touch points) dimensions. WordGesture-GAN introduces a Variational Auto-Encoder to extract and embed variations of user-drawn gestures into a Gaussian distribution which can be sampled to control variation in generated gestures. Our experiments on a dataset with 38k gesture samples show that WordGesture-GAN outperforms existing gesture production models including the minimum jerk model [37] and the style-transfer GAN [31, 32] in generating realistic gestures. Overall, our research demonstrates that the proposed GAN structure can learn variations in user-drawn gestures, and the resulting WordGesture-GAN can generate word-gesture movement and predict the distribution of gestures. WordGesture-GAN can serve as a valuable tool for designing and evaluating gestural input systems.

uKnit: A Position-Aware Reconfigurable Machine-Knitted Wearable for Gestural Interaction and Passive Sensing using Electrical Impedance Tomography,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580692,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580692,"
 A scarf is inherently reconfigurable: wearers often use it as a neck wrap, a shawl, a headband, a wristband, and more. We developed uKnit, a scarf-like soft sensor with scarf-like reconfigurability, built with machine knitting and electrical impedance tomography sensing. Soft wearable devices are comfortable and thus attractive for many human-computer interaction scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated various soft wearable capabilities, each capability is device- and location-specific, being incapable of meeting users’ various needs with a single device. In contrast, uKnit explores the possibility of one-soft-wearable-for-all. We describe the fabrication and sensing principles behind uKnit, demonstrate several example applications, and evaluate it with 10-participant user studies and a washability test. uKnit achieves 88.0%/78.2% accuracy for 5-class worn-location detection and 80.4%/75.4% accuracy for 7-class gesture recognition with a per-user/universal model. Moreover, it identifies respiratory rate with an error rate of 1.25 bpm and detects binary sitting postures with an average accuracy of 86.2%.

The growing platformization of health has spurred new avenues for healthcare access and reinvigorated telemedicine as a viable pathway to care. Telemedicine adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic has surfaced barriers to patient-centered care that call for attention. Our work extends current Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on telemedicine and the challenges to remote care, and investigates the scope for enhancing remote care seeking and provision through telemedicine workflows involving intermediation. Our study, focused on the urban Indian context, involved providing doctors with videos of remote clinical examinations to aid in telemedicine. We present a qualitative evaluation of this modified telemedicine experience, highlighting how workflows involving intermediation could bridge existing gaps in telemedicine, and how their acceptance among doctors could shift interaction dynamics between doctors and patients. We conclude by discussing the implications of such telemedicine workflows on patient-centered care and the future of care work.

Just Do Something: Comparing Self-proposed and Machine-recommended Stress Interventions among Online Workers with Home Sweet Office,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581319,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581319,"
Modern stress management techniques have been shown to be effective, particularly when applied systematically and with the supervision of an instructor. However, online workers usually lack sufficient support from therapists and learning resources to self-manage their stress. To better assist these users, we implemented a browser-based application, Home Sweet Office (HSO), to administer a set of stress micro-interventions which mimic existing therapeutic techniques, including somatic, positive psychology, meta cognitive, and cognitive behavioral categories. In a four-week field study, we compared random and machine-recommended interventions to interventions that were self-proposed by participants in order to investigate effective content and recommendation methods. Our primary findings suggest that both machine-recommended and self-proposed interventions had significantly higher momentary efficacy than random selection, whereas machine-recommended interventions offer more activity diversity compared to self-proposed interventions. We conclude with reflections on these results, discuss features and mechanisms which might improve efficacy, and suggest areas for future work.

 Glazed ceramic is a versatile material that we use every day. In this paper, we present a new approach that instruments existing glazed ceramic ware with interactive electronic circuits. We informed this work by collaborating with a ceramics designer and connected his craft practice to our experience in physical computing. From this partnership, we developed a systematic approach that begins with the subtractive fabrication of traces on glazed ceramic surfaces via the resist-blasting technique, followed by applying conductive ink into the inlaid traces. We capture and detail this approach through an annotated flowchart for others to refer to, as well as externalize the material insights we uncovered through ceramic and circuit swatches. We then demonstrate a range of interactive home applications built with this approach. Finally, we reflect on the process we took and discuss the importance of collaborating with craftspeople for material-driven research within HCI.

This work explores how users navigate the opaque and ever-changing algorithmic processes that dictate visibility on Instagram through the lens of Attachment Theory. We conducted thematic analysis on 1,100 posts and comments on r/Instagram to understand how users engage in collective sensemaking with regards to Instagram’s algorithms, user-perceived punishments, and strategies to counteract algorithmic precarity. We found that the unpredictability in how Instagram rewards or punishes a user can lead to distress, hypervigilance, and a need to appease “the algorithm’’. We therefore frame these findings through Attachment Theory, drawing upon the metaphor of Instagram as an unreliable paternalistic figure that inconsistently rewards users [74]. User experiences are then contextualized through the lens of anxious, avoidant, disorganized, and secure attachment. We conclude by making suggestions for fostering secure attachment towards the Instagram algorithm, by suggesting potential strategies to help users successfully cope with uncertainty.

We used a computational notebook to engage young adults, carers, and clinicians with an example ML model that predicted health risk in diabetes care. Through co-design workshops and retrospective interviews, we found that participants particularly valued using the interactive data visualisations of the computational notebook to scaffold multidisciplinary learning, anticipate benefits and harms of the example ML model, and create fictional feature importance plots to highlight care needs. Participants also reported challenges, from running code cells to managing information asymmetries and power imbalances. We discuss the potential of leveraging computational notebooks as interactive co-design tools to meet end user needs early in ML model lifecycles.

 AI-based design tools are proliferating in professional software to assist engineering and industrial designers in complex manufacturing and design tasks. These tools take on more agentic roles than traditional computer-aided design tools and are often portrayed as “co-creators.” Yet, working effectively with such systems requires different skills than working with complex CAD tools alone. To date, we know little about how engineering designers learn to work with AI-based design tools. In this study, we observed trained designers as they learned to work with two AI-based tools on a realistic design task. We find that designers face many challenges in learning to effectively co-create with current systems, including challenges in understanding and adjusting AI outputs and in communicating their design goals. Based on our findings, we highlight several design opportunities to better support designer-AI co-creation.

Understanding and Mitigating Technology-Facilitated Privacy Violations in the Physical World,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580909,0,https://maximiliane-windl.com/papers/privacyviolations_final.pdf,"
We are constantly surrounded by technology that collects and processes sensitive data, paving the way for privacy violations. Yet, current research investigating technology-facilitated privacy violations in the physical world is scattered and focused on specific scenarios or investigates such violations purely from an expert’s perspective. Informed through a large-scale online survey, we first construct a scenario taxonomy based on user-experienced privacy violations in the physical world through technology. We then validate our taxonomy and establish mitigation strategies using interviews and co-design sessions with privacy and security experts. In summary, this work contributes (1) a refined scenario taxonomy for technology-facilitated privacy violations in the physical world, (2) an understanding of how privacy violations manifest in the physical world, (3) a decision tree on how to inform users, and (4) a design space to create notices whenever adequate. With this, we contribute a conceptual framework to enable a privacy-preserving technology-connected world.

Eye-Perspective View Management for Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581059,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581059,"
 Optical see-through (OST) head-mounted displays (HMDs) enable users to experience Augmented Reality (AR) support in the form of helpful real-world annotations. Unfortunately, the blend of the environment with virtual augmentations due to semitransparent OST displays often deteriorates the contrast and legibility of annotations. View management algorithms adapt the annotations’ layout to improve legibility based on real-world information, typically captured by built-in HMD cameras. However, the camera views are different from the user’s view through the OST display which decreases the final layout quality. We present eye-perspective view management that synthesizes high-fidelity renderings of the user’s view to optimize annotation placement. Our method significantly improves over traditional camera-based view management in terms of annotation placement and legibility. Eye-perspective optimizations open up opportunities for further research on use cases relying on the user’s true view through OST HMDs.

Many people gather online and form teams with strangers to collaborate on tasks. However, while intrateam trust and cohesion are critical for team performance, such characteristics take time to establish and are harder to build up through computer-mediated communication. Building on prior research that has shown that enhancing familiarity between members can help, we hypothesized that the use of a chatbot to support the familiarization of ad hoc teammates can help their collaboration. As such, we designed IntroBot, a chatbot that builds on an online discussion facilitator framework and leverages the social media data of users to assist their familiarization process. Through a between-subjects study (N=60), we found that participants who used IntroBot reported higher levels of trust, cohesion, and interaction quality, as well as generated more ideas in a collaborative brainstorming task. We discuss insights gained from our study, and present opportunities for the future of chatbot-assisted collaboration.

 The current spread of social and assistive robotics applications is increasingly highlighting the need for robots that can be easily taught and interacted with, even by users with no technical background. Still, it is often difficult to grasp what such robots know or to assess if a correct representation of the task is being formed. Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to bridge this gap. We demonstrate three use cases where AR design elements enhance the explainability and efficiency of human-robot interaction: 1) a human teaching a robot some simple kitchen tasks by demonstration, 2) the robot showing its plan for solving novel tasks in AR to a human for validation, and 3) a robot communicating its intentions via AR while assisting people with limited mobility during daily activities.

Long COVID is a post-viral illness where symptoms are still experienced more than three months after an infection of COVID 19. In line with a recent shift within HCI and research on self-tracking towards first-person methodologies, I present the results of an 18-month long autoethnographic study of using a Fitbit fitness tracker whilst having long COVID. In contrast to its designed intentions, I misused my Fitbit to do less in order to pace and manage my illness. My autoethnography illustrates three modes of using fitness tracking technologies to do less and points to the new design space of technologies for reducing, rather than increasing, activity in order to manage chronic illnesses where over-exertion would lead to a worsening of symptoms. I propose that these “pacing technologies” should acknowledge the interoceptive and fluctuating nature of the user's body and support user's decision-making when managing long-term illness and maintaining quality of life.

An ongoing mystery of HCI is how do well-intentioned designers consistently enable products with unintentionally evil consequences. Using “questionable values” as a lens, we retell and analyze four design scenarios for smart homes that were created by participants with an IoT toolkit we designed. The selected design scenarios reveal practices that violate principles of responsible smart home design. Through our analysis we show (1) how participants explore sensor-driven objectification of the home then leverage data for surveillance, nudging, and control over others; (2) how the dominant technosolutionist narratives of efficiency and productivity ground such questionable values; (3) and how the materiality of mass-produced sensors pre-mediates questionable design scenarios. We discuss how to attend to and utilize questionable values in design: Making space for questionable values will empower design researchers to better “look around corners”, anticipating tomorrow's concerns and forestalling the worst of their harms.

Beyond Skin Deep: Generative Co-Design for Aesthetic Prosthetics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580803,0,,"
 There is a trend for handcrafting bespoke prostheses that embody their wearers’ aesthetic tastes and identities. We explore how this might be extended by enabling users to co-design with algorithms. We report a design-led exploration (Figure 1) in which professional disabled dancers danced with a generative design algorithm to create personalised designs called aesthetic seeds. Further algorithms applied these to prosthetic greaves, rendering them in various materials before optimising for additive manufacture. Interviews with our dancers revealed that the aesthetics of prosthetics reach beyond visual decoration to encompass form, function, bodily experience, body image, and identity; that interactions with generative design algorithms can harness people’s expressive and aesthetic skills; and that we must redesign supporting technologies for diverse bodies. We generalise our findings into a process for how people may co-design 3D printable products with algorithms.

ProObjAR: Prototyping Spatially-aware Interactions of Smart Objects with AR-HMD,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580750,0,,"
 The rapid advances in technologies have brought new interaction paradigms of smart objects (e.g., digital devices) beyond digital device screens. By utilizing spatial properties, configurations, and movements of smart objects, designing spatial interaction, which is one of the emerging interaction paradigms, efficiently promotes engagement with digital content and physical facility. However, as an important phase of design, prototyping such interactions still remains challenging, since there is no ad-hoc approach for this emerging paradigm. Designers usually rely on methods that require fixed hardware setup and advanced coding skills to script and validate early-stage concepts. These requirements restrict the design process to a limited group of users in indoor scenes. To facilitate the prototyping to general usages, we aim to figure out the design difficulties and underlying needs of current design processes for spatially-aware object interactions by empirical studies. Besides, we explore the design space of the spatial interaction for smart objects and discuss the design space in an input-output spatial interaction model. Based on these findings, we present ProObjAR, an all-in-one novel prototyping system with an Augmented Reality Head Mounted Display (AR-HMD). Our system allows designers to easily obtain the spatial data of smart objects being prototyped, specify spatially-aware interactive behaviors from an input-output event triggering workflow, and test the prototyping results in situ. From the user study, we find that ProObjAR simplifies the design procedure and increases design efficiency to a large extent and thus advancing the development of spatially-aware applications in smart ecosystems.

 Designing a visualization is often a process of iterative refinement where the designer improves a chart over time by adding features, improving encodings, and fixing mistakes. However, effective design requires external critique and evaluation. Unfortunately, such critique is not always available on short notice and evaluation can be costly. To address this need, we present Perceptual Pat, an extensible suite of AI and computer vision techniques that forms a virtual human visual system for supporting iterative visualization design. The system analyzes snapshots of a visualization using an extensible set of filters—including gaze maps, text recognition, color analysis, etc—and generates a report summarizing the findings. The web-based Pat Design Lab provides a version tracking system that enables the designer to track improvements over time. We validate Perceptual Pat using a longitudinal qualitative study involving 4 professional visualization designers that used the tool over a few days to design a new visualization.

 Perceiving objects’ and avatars’ weight in Virtual Reality (VR) is important to understand their properties and naturally interact with them. However, commercial VR controllers cannot render weight. Controllers presented by previous work are single-handed, slow, or only render a small mass. In this paper, we present PumpVR that renders weight by varying the controllers’ mass according to the properties of virtual objects or bodies. Using a bi-directional pump and solenoid valves, the system changes the controllers’ absolute weight by transferring water in or out with an average error of less than 5%. We implemented VR use cases with objects and avatars of different weights to compare the system with standard controllers. A study with 24 participants revealed significantly higher realism and enjoyment when using PumpVR to interact with virtual objects. Using the system to render body weight had significant effects on virtual embodiment, perceived exertion, and self-perceived fitness.

 Writing text with eye gaze only is an appealing hands-free text entry method. However, existing gaze-based text entry methods introduce eye fatigue and are slow in typing speed because they often require users to dwell on letters of a word, or mark the starting and ending positions of a gaze path with extra operations for entering a word. In this paper, we propose GlanceWriter, a text entry method that allows users to enter text by glancing over keys one by one without any need to dwell on any keys or specify the starting and ending positions of a gaze path when typing a word. To achieve so, GlanceWriter probabilistically determines the letters to be typed based on the dynamics of gaze movements and gaze locations. Our user studies demonstrate that GlanceWriter significantly improves the text entry performance over EyeSwipe, a dwell-free input method using “reverse crossing” to identify the starting and ending keys. GlanceWriter also outperforms the dwell-free gaze input method of Tobii’s Communicator 5, a commercial eye gaze-based communication system. Overall, GlanceWriter achieves dwell-free and crossing-free text entry by probabilistically decoding gaze paths, offering a promising gaze-based text entry method.

Over the last decade, smart home technology (SHT) has become an integral part of modern households. As a result, smart home ecosystems blend with daily social life, appropriated and integrated into personalised domestic environments. The lived experience of inhabiting smart home ecosystems, however, is not yet understood, resulting in a mismatch between ecosystem design and inhabitants’ needs. Drawing on contextual inquiry methods, we conducted an explorative interview study (N=20) with SHT users in their homes. Our thematic analysis reveals how users shape their smart home ecosystems (SHEs), considering social relationships at home, perceived ownership of SHTs, and expected key benefits. Notably, our analysis shows that household members consciously choose ‘their’ level of SHT interconnectedness, reflecting social, spatial and functional affinities between systems. Following our findings, we formulate five implications for designing future SHTs. Our work contributes insights on the dynamics and appropriation of smart home ecosystems by their inhabitants.

 Digitalization has motivated romance novelists to move from traditional to self-publishing online. However, engagement with flexible and responsive, yet precarious and biased algorithmic systems online pose challenges for novelists. Through surveying and interviewing the novelists, and using the lens of feminist political economy, we investigate how digitalization has impacted the novelists’ work practices. Our findings detail the increased agency afforded by self-publishing online, which comes at the expense of performing new forms of work individually, collectively, and with assistance, otherwise performed by publishing houses. We focus on the immaterial, invisible, and unpaid work that the novelists and the ecology of workers surrounding them conducted. We make recommendations for designing digital labor platforms that support the work practices of self-employed digital workers toward a more sustainable, collective, and inclusive future(s) of work.

 Most contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) experiences are made for standing users. However, when a user is lying down—either by choice or necessity—it is unclear how they can walk around, dodge obstacles, or grab distant objects. We rotate the virtual coordinate space to study the movement requirements and user experience of using VR while lying down. Fourteen experienced VR users engaged with various popular VR applications for 40 minutes in a study using a think-aloud protocol and semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of captured videos and interviews reveals that using VR while lying down is comfortable and usable and that the virtual perspective produces a potent illusion of standing up. However, commonplace movements in VR are surprisingly difficult when lying down, and using alternative interactions is fatiguing and hampers performance. To conclude, we discuss design opportunities to tackle the most significant challenges and to create new experiences.

 We explored continuous changes in self-other identity by designing an interpersonal facial morphing experience where the facial images of two users are blended and then swapped over time. Both users’ facial images are displayed side by side, with each user controlling their own morphing facial images, allowing us to create and investigate a multifaceted interpersonal experience. To explore this with diverse social relationships, we conducted qualitative and quantitative investigations through public exhibitions. We found that there is a window of self-identification as well as a variety of interpersonal experiences in the facial morphing process. From these insights, we synthesized a Self-Other Continuum represented by a sense of agency and facial identity. This continuum has implications in terms of the social and subjective aspects of interpersonal communication, which enables further scenario design and could complement findings from research on interactive devices for remote communication.

 Mobile users commonly multitask during travel, but doing so on public transit can be challenging due to the dynamic nature of the environment as well as long-standing lack of infrastructural support. Nevertheless, HCI scholars and practitioners have devoted relatively little attention to developing technology for enhancing travel multitasking. To facilitate such development, we sought to understand travel multitaskers’ practices and challenges while on public transit, and to that end, conducted a multi-methods study that involved shadowing and interviewing 30 of them. We identified four travel-multitasking patterns, characterized by distinct motives that affected these travelers’ multitasking practices, receptivity to environmental stimuli, and task persistence. The two main challenges they encountered during travel multitasking resulted from mutual interference from their tasks and from the dynamic nature of transit environments. Based on these findings, design recommendations for public-transit agencies and mobile services are also provided.

 We present AdHocProx, a system that uses device-relative, inside-out sensing to augment co-located collaboration across multiple devices, without recourse to externally-anchored beacons – or even reliance on WiFi connectivity.  AdHocProx achives this via sensors including dual ultra-wideband (UWB) radios for sensing distance and angle to other devices in dynamic, ad-hoc arrangements; plus capacitive grip to determine where the user’s hands hold the device, and to partially correct for the resulting UWB signal attenuation. All spatial sensing and communication takes place via the side-channel capability of the UWB radios, suitable for small-group collaboration across up to four devices (eight UWB radios).  Together, these sensors detect proximity and natural, socially meaningful device movements to enable contextual interaction techniques. We find that AdHocProx can obtain 95% accuracy recognizing various ad-hoc device arrangements in an offline evaluation, with participants particularly appreciative of interaction techniques that automatically leverage proximity-awareness and relative orientation amongst multiple devices.

Data visualizations can be complex or involve numerous data points, making them impractical to navigate using screen readers alone. Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to support visualization interpretation and exploration without overwhelming blind and low vision (BLV) users. To investigate if and how QA systems can help BLV users in working with visualizations, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study with 24 BLV people where participants freely posed queries about four visualizations. We collected 979 queries and mapped them to popular analytic task taxonomies. We found that retrieving value and finding extremum were the most common tasks, participants often made complex queries and used visual references, and the data topic notably influenced the queries. We compile a list of design considerations for accessible chart QA systems and make our question corpus publicly available to guide future research and development.

 When conducting qualitative research it is necessary to decide how many researchers should be involved in coding the data: Is one enough or are more coders beneficial? To offer empirical evidence for this question, we designed a series of studies investigating qualitative coding. We replicated and extended a usable security and privacy study by Ion et al. to gather both simple survey data and complex interview data. We had a total of 65 students and seven researchers analyze different parts of this data. We analyzed the codebook creation process, similarity of outcomes, inter-rater reliability, and compared the student to the researcher outcomes. We also surveyed five years of SOUPS-PC members about their views on coding. The reviewers view on coding practices for complex and simple data are almost identical. However, our results suggest that the coding process can be different for the two types of data, with complex data benefiting more from interaction between coders.

The Perceived Utility of Smartphone and Wearable Sensor Data in Digital Self-tracking Technologies for Mental Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581209,0,,"
 Mental health symptoms are commonly discovered in primary care. Yet, these settings are not set up to provide psychological treatment. Digital interventions can play a crucial role in stepped care management of patients’ symptoms where patients are offered a low intensity intervention, and treatment evolves to incorporate providers if needed. Though digital interventions often use smartphone and wearable sensor data, little is known about patients’ desires to use these data to manage mental health symptoms. In 10 interviews with patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety, we explored their: symptom self-management, current and desired use of sensor data, and comfort sharing such data with providers. Findings support the use digital interventions to manage mental health, yet they also highlight a misalignment in patient needs and current efforts to use sensors. We outline considerations for future research, including extending design thinking to wraparound services that may be necessary to truly reduce healthcare burden.

 Notifications are commonly considered a distraction when they arrive during a task, and consequently, prior research has consistently sought effective ways of deferring their arrival until task transitions. However, many smartphone users still interact with notifications during tasks. In our qualitative study combining diary study and semi-structured interviews, we examined 34 research participants’ motivations for interacting with smartphone notifications at different times, including during tasks. Our findings resulted in a human-notification interaction framework comprised of 12 unique motivations frequently associated with three activity timings for interacting with notifications, including before-task, during-task, and after-task. Notably, participants frequently perceived interaction with notifications as a tool for improving task performance, making the most of their time, and promoting personal well-being, rather than only as a distraction. The before-the-task timing, in particular, has received little attention in previous research and deserves more attention as it was related to specific user motivations for notification interaction.

 Visual arts play an important role in cultural life and provide access to social heritage and self-enrichment, but most visual arts are inaccessible to blind people. Researchers have explored different ways to enhance blind people’s access to visual arts (e.g., audio descriptions, tactile graphics). However, how blind people adopt these methods remains unknown. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 blind visual arts patrons to understand how they engage with visual artwork and the factors that influence their adoption of visual arts access methods. We further examined interview insights in a follow-up survey (N=220). We present: 1) current practices and challenges of accessing visual artwork in-person and online (e.g., Zoom tour), 2) motivation and cognition of perceiving visual arts (e.g., imagination), and 3) implications for designing visual arts access methods. Overall, our findings provide a roadmap for technology-based support for blind people’s visual arts experiences.

 Children Living with Health Complexity (CLHC), whose multiple, severe and chronic conditions differentiate them from those with “complicated” conditions, rely life-long on a vast and ever-shifting array of care providers. Their parent caregivers face a fragmented health care system, disconnected medical records, inter-stakeholder communication barriers and an impenetrable accumulation of documentation – from mundane to life-critical, and largely on paper. They must coordinate care while organizing, tracking and transmitting trends in many health parameters to myriad care providers. We engaged with parent caregivers of CLHC from 12 families through an iterative, 3-phase co-design process to understand their needs for a future digital management system. We share our deepened understanding of their information-centered challenges, a set of principles for how design best-practices need to shift when targeting this acutely high-needs group, and a medium-fidelity prototype user interface which from the ground-up prioritizes caregiver-centered data integration and humanization of the child and family, as well as integrated health record access.

The field of Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) has been consistently utilizing kinematic mechanisms to create tangible dynamic interfaces and objects. However, the design and fabrication of these mechanisms are challenging due to complex spatial structures, step-by-step assembly processes, and unstable joint connections resulting from the inevitable matching errors within separated parts. In this paper, we propose an integrated fabrication method for one-step FDM 3D printing (FDM3DP) kinematic mechanisms to create dynamic objects without additional post-processing. We describe the Arch-printing and Support-bridges method, which we call All-in-One Print, that compiles given arbitrary solid 3D models into printable kinematic models as G-Code for FDM3DP. To expand the design space, we investigate a series of motion structures (e.g., rotate, slide, and screw) with multi-stabilities and develop a design tool to help users quickly design such dynamic objects. We also demonstrate various application cases, including physical interfaces, toys with interactive aesthetics and daily items with internalized functions.

 HCI researchers have been investigating family dynamics with new and emerging technologies during joint media engagement (JME) experiences. However, most studies describe family dynamics from parents’ perspectives, such as their roles and mediation practices, while the roles and agency of other family members are less understood. In this paper, we examine family dynamics through the lens of negotiation between family members. Our study is located within an informal learning program called Family Creative Learning, where families from non-dominant groups were invited to participate in a series of workshops to create with a programming app called ScratchJr. Through analysis of data that included process, artifact, and reflective data, we identify negotiation practices of family members as they advocate for device and creative control. We further discuss how the lens of negotiation expands the meaning of productive JME in family contexts and highlight design considerations to facilitate engaging joint family experiences with educational technologies.

It's Like an Educated Guessing Game: Parents' Strategies for Collaborative Diabetes Management with Their Children,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581522,0,,"
 Children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) face many challenges with keeping their blood glucose levels within a healthy range because they cannot manage their illness by themselves. To prevent children’s blood glucose from becoming too high or too low, parents apply different strategies to avoid risky situations. To understand how parents of children with T1D manage these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with children with T1D (ages 6-12) and their parents (N=41). We identified four types of strategies used by parents (i.e., educated guessing game, contingency planning, experimentation, and reaching out for help) that can be categorized according to two dimensions: 1) the cause of risk (known or unknown) and 2) the occurrence of risk (predictable or unpredictable). Based on our findings, we provide design implications for collaborative health technologies that support parents in better planning for contingencies and identifying unknown causes of risks together with their children.

However, most such systems appear to focus on instrumental benefits, missing out on the opportunity to use bodily extensions for play and its associated benefits (including a lower adoption barrier and the potential to reveal a broader understanding of such technologies). To begin understanding the design of playful bodily extensions, we interviewed five designers of bodily extensions that have been showcased in prestigious academic venues or turned into commercial products. Here we present themes and actionable advice from these interviews for the design of playful bodily extensions through a thematic analysis. Our work aims to support the design of future playful bodily extensions while promoting the experiential qualities of bodily extension design, with the ultimate goal of bringing more playful experiences to people’s lives.

Conventional data visualization tools and guidelines often do not actively consider the specific needs and abilities of people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), leaving them excluded from data-driven activities and vulnerable to ethical issues. To understand the needs and challenges people with IDD have with data, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with individuals with IDD and their caregivers. Our algorithmic interview approach situated data in the lived experiences of people with IDD to uncover otherwise hidden data encounters in their everyday life. Drawing on findings and observations, we characterize how they conceptualize data, when and where they use data, and what barriers exist when they interact with data. We use our results as a lens to reimagine the role of visualization in data accessibility and establish a critical near-term research agenda for cognitively accessible visualization.

Restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected people's opportunities to engage in activities that are meaningful to their lives. In response to these constraints, many people, including older adults, turned to digital technologies as alternative ways to pursue meaningful activities. These technology-mediated activities, however, presented new challenges for older adults’ everyday use of technology. In this paper, we investigate how older adults used digital technologies for meaningful activities during COVID-19 restrictions. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 older adults and analyzed the interview data through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT). Our analysis shows that using digital technologies for meaningful activities can both support and undermine older people's three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We argue that future technologies should be designed to empower older adults’ content creation, engagement in personal interests, exploration of technology, effortful communication, and participation in beneficent activities.

This work contributes to the discussion by unpacking co-production challenges faced by practitioners as they align their RAI values. We interviewed 23 individuals, across 10 organizations, tasked to ship AI/ML based products while upholding RAI norms and found that both top-down and bottom-up institutional structures create burden for different roles preventing them from upholding RAI values, a challenge that is further exacerbated when executing conflicted values. We share multiple value levers used as strategies by the practitioners to resolve their challenges. We end our paper with recommendations for inclusive and equitable RAI value-practices, creating supportive organizational structures and opportunities to further aid practitioners.

We develop a prototype system that automatically generates text explanations from a given chart specification. We conduct an exploratory study with 24 legally blind people to observe both the effectiveness and the perceived effectiveness of the strategies. The findings include: description of visual appearance is overall more effective than instructions for drawing, effective strategies differ by each chart type and by each participant, and the user’s perceived effectiveness does not always lead to better performance.

 International program development is a complex process involving many stakeholders. Current international practice affords limited, if any, opportunities for direct community-led input into the program commissioning process, resulting in programs that may not meet the specific needs of communities on the ground. Community voice is one source of data that could help focus the design of effective development programs and interventions. However, development programs are primarily formulated based on representative and often quantitative data conducted by experts from outside the community. Through a participatory video production process with disadvantaged women farmers in rural Bangladesh, we explore the opportunities for including meaningful community voices in these institutionalized processes. We present practical design implications for how community-generated voices can act as rich data, establishing confidence, community bonds and senses of accountability to inform early stages of project development, and to specifically augment and contextualize other data sources.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have become an integral part of our society. However, studying AI as one entity or studying idiosyncratic applications separately both have limitations. Thus, this study used computational methods to categorize ten different AI roles prevalent in our everyday life and compared laypeople’s perceptions of them using online survey data (N = 727). Based on theoretical factors related to the fundamental nature of AI, the principal component analysis revealed two dimensions that categorize AI: human involvement and AI autonomy. K-means clustering identified four AI role clusters: tools (low in both dimensions), servants (high human involvement and low AI autonomy), assistants (low human involvement and high AI autonomy), and mediators (high in both dimensions). Multivariate analyses of covariances revealed that people assessed AI mediators the most and AI tools the least favorably. Demographics also influenced laypeople’s assessments of AI.

Cognitive biases have been shown to play a critical role in creating echo chambers and spreading misinformation. They undermine our ability to evaluate information and can influence our behaviour without our awareness. To allow the study of occurrences and effects of biases on information consumption behaviour, we explore indicators for cognitive biases in physiological and interaction data. Therefore, we conducted two experiments investigating how people experience statements that are congruent or divergent from their own ideological stance. We collected interaction data, eye tracking data, hemodynamic responses, and electrodermal activity while participants were exposed to ideologically tainted statements. Our results indicate that people spend more time processing statements that are incongruent with their own opinion. We detected differences in blood oxygenation levels between congruent and divergent opinions, a first step towards building systems to detect and quantify cognitive biases.

Multi-stage programming tutorials are key learning resources for programmers, using progressive incremental steps to teach them how to build larger software systems. A good multi-stage tutorial describes the code clearly, explains the rationale and code changes for each step, and allows readers to experiment as they work through the tutorial. In practice, it is time-consuming for authors to create tutorials with these attributes. In this paper, we introduce Colaroid, an interactive authoring tool for creating high quality multi-stage tutorials. Colaroid tutorials are augmented computational notebooks, where snippets and outputs represent a snapshot of a project, with source code differences highlighted, complete source code context for each snippet, and the ability to load and tinker with any stage of the project in a linked IDE. In two laboratory studies, we found Colaroid makes it easy to create multi-stage tutorials, while offering advantages to readers compared to video and web-based tutorials.

 Electrification is an important first step toward reducing the greenhouse emissions of passenger vehicles. However, how drivers drive, charge, and operate their electrified vehicles can have a large impact on their emissions, particularly for Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles (PHEVs) that combine all-electric driving with an internal combustion engine. In this paper, we investigate how and why drivers use their PHEVs and uncover design opportunities for interfaces that can support the efficient use of PHEVs. We used a mixed-method approach combining quantitative, qualitative, and concept elicitation methods with PHEV owners in the US. While past findings indicate that PHEV drivers are not motivated to charge regularly, our work contradicts this with evidence of (1) regular charging with home infrastructure, (2) high cost sensitivity, and (3) preference for driving in all-electric mode. Our results indicate that the most critical problem is inadequate user support for navigating poor charging infrastructure.

We provide a number of cases, textile-form methods and vocabulary to enable exploration in this emerging design space. MMTF grants insights into textiles as complex material systems whose behaviour can be tuned across material, interaction and ecological scales for conformal, seamless, and sustainable outcomes.

The ever-increasing number of devices quantifying our lives offers a perspective of high awareness of one’s wellbeing, yet it remains a challenge for personal informatics (PI) to effectively support data-based reflection. Effective reflection is recognised as a key factor for PI technologies to foster wellbeing. Here, we investigate whether building tangible representations of health data can offer engaging and reflective experiences. We conducted a between-subjects study where n = 60 participants explored their immediate blood pressure data in relation to medical norms. They either used a standard mobile app, built a data representation from LEGO® bricks based on instructions, or completed a free-form brick build. We found that building with instructions fostered more comparison and using bricks fostered focused attention. The free-form condition required extra time to complete, and lacked usability. Our work shows that designing instructional physicalisation experiences for PI is a means of improving engagement and understanding of personal data.

 Audio descriptions (AD) make videos accessible to those who cannot see them. But many videos lack AD and remain inaccessible as traditional approaches involve expensive professional production. We aim to lower production costs by involving novices in this process. We present an AD authoring system that supports novices to write scene descriptions (SD)—textual descriptions of video scenes—and convert them into AD via text-to-speech. The system combines video scene recognition and natural language processing to review novice-written SD and feeds back what to mention automatically. To assess the effectiveness of this automatic feedback in supporting novices, we recruited 60 participants to author SD with no feedback, human feedback, and automatic feedback. Our study shows that automatic feedback improves SD’s descriptiveness, objectiveness, and learning quality, without affecting qualities like sufficiency and clarity.

Single-sided deafness (SSD) significantly restricts social participation in hearing/speaking cultures due to the person’s difficulty hearing conversations on their deaf side. Although hearing aids for SSD are effective in social situations, the acceptance rate remains low at 4%. To address this problem, we designed and developed a bone conduction-based device to be worn with eyeglasses, involving 53 individuals with SSD including two authors. We conducted a four-week diary study comparing our proposed device with traditional Contralateral Routing of Signals (CROS) hearing aids and explored the factors that might affect the acceptance rate of assistive devices for SSD. The findings indicated that our design was more acceptable for users with SSD due to its effectiveness, social acceptability, and the ability for wearers to use other devices simultaneously, such as earbuds. Based on our results, we discuss implications for designing wearable assistive devices to promote greater acceptance among the target population.

Lettersmith: Scaffolding Written Professional Communication Among College Students,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581029,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581029,"
 Professional writing is critical for job search and performance, but many – especially those without work experience – struggle to write well. We introduce an instructional approach called ‘scaffolded annotation’ as a way to guide students in creating initial drafts of professional writing, like client emails and cover letters. We studied the implementation of scaffolded annotation in a digital platform called Lettersmith. First, we performed a quasi-experimental study and found that students applying scaffolded annotation in Lettersmith were more likely to include key components of professional writing. We also interviewed instructors and students who used Lettersmith and found that scaffolded annotation helped students in guiding structure, content, and tone. Instructors found the approach useful for articulating writing task expectations, pinpointing student gaps in understanding, and scaling instructional support for early-stage drafting. We provide implications for writing instruction and HCI researchers developing writing support tools.

Remote Wavelength: Design and Evaluation of a System for Social Connectedness Through Distributed Tabletop Gameplay,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581142,0,,"
Playing remote tabletop games is a fun way to connect with distant friends. Yet most systems for remote tabletop gaming lack support for tangible and social interaction, two important aspects of gameplay for most players. We are interested in how to better design systems for remote tangible gameplay that support social connection. We investigate this topic through the design and evaluation of a prototype system for playing the board game Wavelength across two locations. First, we describe the design goals that informed our prototype: “Remote Wavelength”. Then, we discuss the results of a qualitative user study in which ten friend groups played Remote Wavelength. Our findings indicate that a synchronized, tangible gameboard benefits player engagement, communication, and awareness. Our results also illustrate the value of integration across communication and gameplay systems. We conclude by offering considerations for the design of both digital and remote tangible gameplay systems.

"Communicating Consequences: Visual Narratives, Abstraction, and Polysemy in Rural Bangladesh",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581149,0,,"
 Information communication and visualization practices reflect two centuries of developments of conventions and best practices which may not be reflective of global audiences’ methods for conveying information. Contrasting between rural traditional visual culture and contemporary HCI and data-visualization, we argue that an understanding of traditional practices for information visualization is required for building rich data-narratives and making data-driven systems more accessible and culturally situated. Our ten-month ethnographic study investigates how rural Bangladeshi communities construct narratives through visual media. 1 Our observation, interviews, and FGDs (n=54) expose how participants convey risk management, decision-making, and monetary management practices to their peers. We find that villagers used a rich network of polysemic symbols and abstractions to manifest subjectivity, factuality, consequence, situatedness, and uncertainty; varied visual attributes for constructing narratives; and emphasized material relations among components in visuals. These findings inform the design of future systems for decision support in a culturally situated manner.

Measurement Patterns: User-Oriented Strategies for Dealing with Measurements and Dimensions in Making Processes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581157,0,https://research.tue.nl/files/289893671/paper.pdf,"
The majority of errors in making processes can be tracked back to errors in dimensional specifications. While technical aspects of measurement, such as precision and speed have been extensively studied in metrology, the user aspects of measurement received significantly less attention. While little research exists that specifically addresses the user aspects of handling dimensions, various systems have been built that embed new interactive modalities, processes, and techniques which significantly impact how users deal with dimensions or conduct measurements. However, these features are mostly hidden in larger system contributions. To uncover and articulate these techniques, we conducted a holistic literature survey on measurement practices in crafting techniques and systems for rapid prototyping. Based on this survey, we contribute  10 measurement patterns, which describe reusable elements and solutions for common difficulties when dealing with dimensions throughout workflows for making physical artifacts.

Such reviews were identified based on selection criteria applied over 179,519,598 reviews of popular apps on the Google Play Store. Our results show that only 0,003% of user reviews mention visual disabilities or conditions; accessibility reviews are associated with 36 visual disabilities or eye conditions; many users do not give precise feedback and refer to their disability using generic terms; accessibility reviews can be grouped into general topics of concerns related to different types of disabilities; and positive reviews are generally associated with high scores and negative feedback with lower scores.

BubbleTex: Designing Heterogenous Wettable Areas for Carbonation Bubble Patterns on Surfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581030,1,,"
Materials are a key part of our daily experiences. Recently, researchers have been devising new ways to utilize materials directly from our physical world for the design of objects and interactions. We present a new fabrication technique that enables control of CO2 bubble positions and their size within carbonated liquids. Instead of soap bubbles, boiling water, or droplets, we show creation of patterns, images and text through sessile bubbles that exhibit a lifetime of several days. Surfaces with mixed wettability regions are created on glass and plastic using ceramic coatings or plasma projection leading to patterns that are relatively invisible to the human eye. Different regions react to liquids differently. Nucleation is activated after carbonated liquid is poured onto the surface with bubbles nucleating in hydrophobic regions with a strong adherence to the surface and can be controlled in size ranging from 0.5mm – 6.5mm. Bubbles go from initially popping or becoming buoyant during CO2 supersaturation to stabilizing at their positions within minutes. Technical evaluation shows stabilization under various conditions. Our design software allows users to import images and convert them into parametric pixelation forms conducive to fabrication that will result in nucleation of bubbles at required positions. Various applications are presented to demonstrate aspects that may be harnessed for a wide range of use in daily life. Through this work, we enable the use of carbonation bubbles as a new design material for designers and researchers.

Sustainability by Design. How to Encourage Users to Choose Energy-Saving Programs and Settings when Washing Laundry,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581150,1,,"
 One way to counteract anthropogenic climate change, is to reduce individual energy consumption. An especially energy-intensive everyday practice is doing the laundry. In Germany, laundry accounts for about 5% of domestic electricity consumption. In part, this is because users do not make use of the energy-saving programs offered by modern washing machines. Based on different principles of behavior change, we created four concepts for washing machine interfaces to encourage users to choose energy-saving programs and settings. These concepts were implemented as functional prototypes. An online experiment (N=400) showed that all concepts increased the choice of energy-saving programs compared to a standard machine. Especially effective was to interrupt impulsive actions and suggest alternative choices (concept B) and to restructure the entry of settings (concept E). This demonstrates how small changes in a standard interfaces can significantly increase the probability of energy conservation in a private setting.

We stretch our bodyminds into the past, present and futures to identify how we might thrive in worlds that welcome us, instead of giving us the persistent notion of being considered as an afterthought. Such a collection is necessarily eclectic and not oriented on providing solutions; rather, we carefully tread forward on trying to find different stories we tell to and about ourselves through speculative explorations of how disability-centred interactions could be shaped. However, as we discuss briefly at the end, allowing ourselves to desire difference has the tendency to throw us back into the lack of a given status quo, making such an endeavour surprisingly painful to endure – while simultaneously providing wholesome alternatives worth fighting for in solidarity.

 This paper investigates how different textile materials on the wrist bands may mediate the affective experience of two forms of tactile icons, namely stroking and squeezing. To this end, we designed Emoband, a wrist-worn textile-based tactile display that can stroke or squeeze on wearers’ wrists through the moving fabrics. We conducted two studies on the participants’ valence and arousal ratings towards the stroking and squeezing feedback from Emoband, respectively. Results showed that the valence ratings were significantly affected by the stroking or squeezing parameters and the wristband’s material, interactively. The movement-related parameters dominated the arousal rating. Meanwhile, the valence ratings demonstrated different tendencies between the two tactile feedback, with the valence increasing and decreasing along with the strength of stroking and squeezing, respectively. Besides, the valence ratings of the stroking stimuli demonstrated varied distributions across different materials, indicating the materials’ varying affective expressiveness in the wrist-worn haptic devices.

We show how such an approach is useful for research into sociotechnical phenomena that exceed the boundaries of discrete disciplines and their convergence. We introduce digital well-being as a case study, drawing on the authors’ own interdisciplinary collaborative experiences in this area as its empirical matter. From this, and in order to aid future research into similarly complex sociotechnical objects, we then provide practical tools to help those in the HCI community prepare and conduct interdisciplinary research in a similarly generative, non-dogmatic, and non-hierarchical manner.

 Social media platforms exacerbate trauma, and many users experience various forms of trauma unique to them (e.g., doxxing and swatting). Trauma is the psychological and physical response to experiencing a deeply disturbing event. Platforms’ failures to address trauma threaten users’ well-being globally, especially amongst minoritized groups. Platform policies also expose moderators and designers to trauma through content they must engage with as part of their jobs (e.g., child sexual abuse). We consider how a trauma-informed approach might help address or decrease the likelihood of (re)experiencing trauma online. A trauma-informed approach to social media recognizes that everyone likely has a trauma history and that trauma is experienced at the individual, secondary, collective, and cultural levels. This paper proceeds by detailing trauma and its impacts. We then describe how the six trauma-informed principles can be applied to social media design, content moderation, and companies. We conclude by offering recommendations that balance platform responsibility and accountability with well-being and healing for all.

Perceptual dissimilarities, requiring high-cost user ratings, have contributed to designing well-distinguishable vibrations for associated meaning delivery. Appropriate metrics can reduce the cost, but known metrics in vibration similarity/dissimilarity could not predict them robustly. We propose a physiology-based model (PM) that predicts the perceptual dissimilarities of a given vibration set via two parallel processes: Neural Coding (NC), mimicking the neural signal transfer, and One-dimensional Convolution (OC), capturing rhythmic features. Eight parameters were trained using six datasets published in the literature to maximize Spearman’s Rank Correlation. We validated PM and six metrics of RMSE, DTW, Spectral/Temporal Matchings, ST-SIM, and SPQI in twelve datasets: six trained and six untrained datasets including measured accelerations. In all validations, PM’s predictions showed robust correlations with user data and similar structures in perceptual spaces. Other baseline metrics showed better fit in specific datasets, but none of them robustly showed correlations and similar perceptual spaces over twelve datasets.

We show how involving trans people and communities in design is vital for trans technologies to realize their potential for addressing trans needs. Yet we highlight a frequent gap between trans technology design and deployment, and discuss ways to bridge this gap. We argue for the importance of involving community in trans technology design to ensure that trans technology achieves its promise of helping address trans needs and challenges.

RetroLens: A Human-AI Collaborative System for Multi-step Retrosynthetic Route Planning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581469,0,,"
Multi-step retrosynthetic route planning (MRRP) is the core task in synthetic chemistry, in which chemists recursively deconstruct a target molecule to find a set of reactants that make up the target. MRRP is challenging in that the search space is vast, and chemists are often lost in the process. Existing AI models can achieve automatic MRRP fast, but they only work on relatively simple targets, which leaves complex molecules under chemists’ expertise. To facilitate MRRP of complex molecules, we proposed a human-AI collaborative system, RetroLens, through a participatory design process. AI can contribute by two approaches: joint action and algorithm-in-the-loop. Deconstruction steps are allocated to chemists or AI based on their capabilities and AI recommends candidate revision steps to fix problems along the way. A within-subjects study (N=18) showed that chemists who used RetroLens reported faster MRRP, broader design space exploration, higher confidence in their planning, and lower cognitive load.

Online meetings are indispensable in collaborative remote work environments, but they are vulnerable to distractions due to their distributed and location-agnostic nature. While distraction often leads to a decrease in online meeting quality due to loss of engagement and context, natural multitasking has positive tradeoff effects, such as increased productivity within a given time unit. In this study, we investigate the impact of real-time transcriptions (i.e., full-transcripts, summaries, and keywords) as a solution to help facilitate online meetings during distracting moments while still preserving multitasking behaviors. Through two rounds of controlled user studies, we qualitatively and quantitatively show that people can better catch up with the meeting flow and feel less interfered with when using real-time transcriptions. The benefits of real-time transcriptions were more pronounced after distracting activities. Furthermore, we reveal additional impacts of real-time transcriptions (e.g., supporting recalling contents) and suggest design implications for future online meeting platforms where these could be adaptively provided to users with different purposes.

Towards a Consensus Gesture Set: A Survey of Mid-Air Gestures in HCI for Maximized Agreement Across Domains,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581420,1,,"
 Mid-air gesture-based systems are becoming ubiquitous. Many mid-air gestures control different kinds of interactive devices, applications, and systems. They are, however, still targeted at specific devices in specific domains and are not necessarily consistent across domain boundaries. A comprehensive evaluation of the transferability of gesture vocabulary between domains is also lacking. Consequently, interaction designers cannot decide which gestures to use for which domain. In this systematic literature review, we contribute to the future research agenda in this area, based on an analysis of 172 papers. As part of our analysis, we clustered gestures according to the dimensions of an existing taxonomy to identify their common characteristics in different domains, and we investigated the extent to which existing mid-air gesture sets are consistent across different domains. We derived a consensus gesture set containing 22 gestures based on agreement rates calculation and considered their transferability across different domains.

To contextualize cinematic endings in data videos, 111 film endings and 105 data video endings are first analyzed to identify four common styles using the framework of ending punctuation marks.  We conducted expert interviews (N=11) and formulated 20 guidelines for creating cinematic endings in data videos. To validate our guidelines, we conducted a user study where 24 participants were invited to design endings with and without our guidelines, which are evaluated by experts and the general public. The participants praise the clarity and usability of the guidelines, and results show that the endings with guidelines are perceived to be more understandable, impressive, and reflective.

Modeling Temporal Target Selection: A Perspective from Its Spatial Correspondence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581011,0,,"
 Temporal target selection requires users to wait and trigger the selection input within a bounded time window, with a selection cursor that is expected to be delayed. This task conceptualizes, for example, a variety of game scenarios such as determining the timing of shooting a projectile towards a moving object. In this work, we explore models that predict “when” users typically perform a selection (i.e., user selection distribution) and their selection error rates in such tasks. We hypothesize that users react to temporal factors including “distance”, “width”, and “delay” as how they treat the corresponding variables in spatial target selection. The derived models are evaluated in a controlled experiment and an MTurk-based online study. Our research contributes new knowledge on user behavior in temporal target selection tasks and its potential connection with its spatial correspondence. Our models and conclusions can benefit both users and designers of relevant interactive applications.

There inhabitants can enjoy and shape their place together without risking depletion of their abilities and motivations to do so. The critique produces political sensibilities that help us make sense of common tensions among inhabitants, landowners, and visitors, and generate possible responses. The critique process itself illustrates how designing through critique with theory can help us think in new ways. This paper contributes a display of how design with critical theory can happen, ultimately to support our abilities and motivations to envision and make places of social flourishing that can respond to our socio-environmental crises.

Results show the benefits of providing more flexibility with a decoupled camera and display, and privacy protection by limiting the camera view. Yet, challenges remain in maneuvering two devices, presenting feedback for the camera view, coordinating camera work between the participant and the examiner, and reluctance towards showing private body regions.

 Speech is expressive in ways that caption text does not capture, with emotion or emphasis information not conveyed.

Automatically captioned speech, we found, lacks affective depth, lending it a hard-to-parse ambiguity and general dullness. Interviewees regularly feel excluded, which some understand is an inherent quality of these types of meetings rather than a consequence of current caption text design. Next, we developed three novel captioning models that depicted, beyond words, features from prosody, emotions, and a mix of both. In an empirical study, 16 dhh participants compared these models with conventional captions. The emotion-based model outperformed traditional captions in depicting emotions and emphasis, with only a moderate loss in legibility, suggesting its potential as a more inclusive design for captions.

Through a systematic artefacts review and a case study on Flavobacteria, we have developed and instantiated a Taxonomy of Surfacing Livingness in Microbial Displays, consisting of six microbe-sensitive, tuneable mechanisms for human noticing of microorganisms: 1) Canvassing, 2) Marking, 3) Magnifying, 4) Translating, 5) Nudging, and 6) Molecular Programming. The taxonomy invites diverse and adaptable ways of generating and crafting microbial displays; towards overcoming microbe-specific surfacing constraints, integrating diverse stakeholders’ values, and enabling nuanced address of microbial welfare.

In doing so, we identify four motivations for abusers who use these harmful attacks and how these acts exploit, monitor, restrict, and sabotage a survivor’s financial well-being and independence. As each dimension of these financial harms warrants a tailored approach, we highlight potential directions for practice and research to protect survivors from technology-enabled financial harms. Broadly, we call for the financial technology sector to consider designing for intimate threats through adversarial thinking, recommend strategies for detecting financially abusive activity and provide guidance for how customer service agents may be financially abuse aware.

 Gamification is a popular technique to improve task engagement, and has broadly been deployed in health and education to a point where many users now expect gameful experiences in these settings. However, gamification has been criticised for being a potential obstacle to the experience of reflection. Motivated by this tension, our work examines how the addition of gamification to a Virtual Reality simulation of breastfeeding impacts player experience and reflection. Using a within-subjects design, we invited 34 participants to take part in a mixed-methods evaluation of a gamified and non-gamified variant of the simulation that included questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results show that gamification improved player experience and encouraged players to reflect on goal achievement and performance. However, it also diverted players’ attention from nuances within the act of nursing. Drawing on our findings, we contribute considerations for the application of gamification in personal and sensitive settings such as breastfeeding.

When such a camera is held by a user, the view includes the user’s hand grip, finger, body pose, face, and the surrounding environment, providing a complete understanding of the visual world and context around it. This capability opens up numerous possibilities for rich mobile input sensing. In OmniSense, we explore the broad input design space for mobile devices with a built-in omni-directional camera and broadly categorize them into three sensing pillars: i) near device ii) around device and iii) surrounding device. In addition we explore potential use cases and applications that leverage these sensing capabilities to solve user needs. Following this, we develop a working system to put these concepts into action, by leveraging these sensing capabilities to enable potential use cases and applications. We studied the system in a technical evaluation and a preliminary user study to gain initial feedback and insights. Collectively these techniques illustrate how a single, omni-purpose sensor on a mobile device affords many compelling ways to enable expressive input, while also affording a broad range of novel applications that improve user experience during mobile interaction.

Assertiveness-based Agent Communication for a Personalized Medicine on Medical Imaging Diagnosis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580682,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580682,"
 Intelligent agents are showing increasing promise for clinical decision-making in a variety of healthcare settings. While a substantial body of work has contributed to the best strategies to convey these agents’ decisions to clinicians, few have considered the impact of personalizing and customizing these communications on the clinicians’ performance and receptiveness. This raises the question of how intelligent agents should adapt their tone in accordance with their target audience. We designed two approaches to communicate the decisions of an intelligent agent for breast cancer diagnosis with different tones: a suggestive (non-assertive) tone and an imposing (assertive) one. We used an intelligent agent to inform about: (1) number of detected findings; (2) cancer severity on each breast and per medical imaging modality; (3) visual scale representing severity estimates; (4) the sensitivity and specificity of the agent; and (5) clinical arguments of the patient, such as pathological co-variables. Our results demonstrate that assertiveness plays an important role in how this communication is perceived and its benefits. We show that personalizing assertiveness according to the professional experience of each clinician can reduce medical errors and increase satisfaction, bringing a novel perspective to the design of adaptive communication between intelligent agents and clinicians.

Matching Mind and Method: Augmented Decision-Making with Digital Companions based on Regulatory Mode Theory,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581529,0,,"
Digital companions shall augment complex human processes like extensive decision-making. However, their acceptance may depend upon their ability to adapt to individuals’ psychological states and preferred decision strategies. Regulatory Mode Theory divides human self-regulation into assessment (i.e., making comparisons) and locomotion (i.e., movement from state to state). These regulatory modes are more or less compatible with different decision strategies. In an experimental study (N=81, 2x2-between-subjects design) we explored whether digital companions can gain higher acceptance by considering these compatibilities. Participants were confronted with a decision task. The assisting digital companion first induced a regulatory mode (assessment vs. locomotion) and subsequently presented information according to one of two decision strategies (full evaluation vs. progressive elimination). We show that a fit between regulatory mode and decision strategy (assessment/full evaluation or locomotion/progressive elimination) leads to a favorable evaluation of decisions and the digital companion. No differences regarding decision accuracy and speed were observed.

Understanding Communication Strategies and Viewer Engagement with Science Knowledge Videos on Bilibili,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581476,0,https://hechangyang.com/papers/CHI23_SciVideo.pdf,"
 As a popular form of online media, videos have been widely used to communicate scientific knowledge on video-sharing platforms. These science knowledge videos take advantage of rich and multi-modality information which has the potential to provoke public engagement with science knowledge and promote self-learning. However, how communicators strategically make science knowledge videos to engage viewers, and how specific communication strategies correlate with viewer engagement remain under-explored. In this paper, we first established a taxonomy of communication strategies currently used in science knowledge videos on Bilibili and then examined the correlations between communication strategies and viewers’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagements measured by post-video comments. Our findings revealed the landscape of rich science communication strategies in science knowledge videos and further uncovered the correlations between these strategies and viewer engagements. We situated our results within prior research on science communication and HCI, and provided design implications for video-sharing platforms to support effective science communication.

Agriculture is foundational for food security on our planet. Considering climate change and other pressures on food production, HCI scholars have increasingly begun to examine how the field should approach agricultural innovation. We conducted a literature review of HCI research through the lens of competing future visions for good food systems : a “conventional” vision of profit-oriented production, and an “alternative” which prioritizes sustainability and community-led practices. Leveraging the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, we provide an empirical analysis of how HCI and adjacent applied computing projects align with these competing visions for agriculture. This review reveals, amongst other findings, a prioritization of the perspectives of the Global North and a need for more careful attention to the constraints and aspirations of subsistence farmers. Finally, we note the limits of the conventional-alternative binary that shapes much of contemporary HCI research focused on agriculture and offer opportunities for transcending this framing.

StoryChat: Designing a Narrative-Based Viewer Participation Tool for Live Streaming Chatrooms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580912,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03852,"
 Live streaming platforms and existing viewer participation tools enable users to interact and engage with an online community, but the anonymity and scale of chat usually result in the spread of negative comments. However, only a few existing moderation tools investigate the influence of proactive moderation on viewers’ engagement and prosocial behavior. To address this, we developed StoryChat, a narrative-based viewer participation tool that utilizes a dynamic graphical plot to reflect chatroom negativity. We crafted the narrative through a viewer-centered (N=65) iterative design process and evaluated the tool with 48 experienced viewers in a deployment study. We discovered that StoryChat encouraged viewers to contribute prosocial comments, increased viewer engagement, and fostered viewers’ sense of community. Viewers reported a closer connection between streamers and other viewers because of the narrative design, suggesting that narrative-based viewer engagement tools have the potential to encourage community engagement and prosocial behaviors.

 The creativity support tools can enhance the hands-on multidisciplinary learning experience by drawing interest in the process of creating the outcome. We present AutomataStage, an AR-mediated creativity support tool for hands-on multidisciplinary learning. AutomataStage utilizes a video see-through interface to support the creation of Interactive Automata. The combination of building blocks and low-cost materials increases the expressiveness. The generative design method and one-to-one guide support the idea development process. It also provides a hardware see-through feature with which inside parts and circuits can be seen and an operational see-through feature that shows the operation in real-time. The visual programming method with a state transition diagram supports the iterative process during the creation process. A user study shows that AutomataStage enabled the students to create diverse Interactive Automata within 40-minute sessions. By creating Interactive Automata, the participants could learn the basic concepts of components. See-through features allowed active exploration with interest while integrating the components. We discuss the implications of hands-on tools with interactive and kinetic content beyond multidisciplinary learning.

Understanding Personal Data Tracking and Sensemaking Practices for Self-Directed Learning in Non-classroom and Non-computer-based Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581364,0,,"
 Self-directed learning is becoming a significant skill for learners. However, learners may suffer from difficulties such as distractions, a lack of motivation, and so on. While self-tracking technologies have the potential to address these challenges, existing tools and systems mainly focused on tracking computer-based learning data in classroom contexts. Little is known about how students track and make sense of their learning data from non-classroom learning activities and which types of learning data are personally meaningful for learners. In this paper, we conducted a qualitative study with 24 users of Timing, a mobile learning tracking application in China. Our findings indicated that users tracked a variety of qualitative learning data (e.g., videos, photos of learning materials, and emotions) and made sense of this data using different strategies such as observing behavioral and contextual details in videos. We then provided implications for designing non-classroom and non-computer-based personal learning tracking tools.

Knowing About Knowing: An Illusion of Human Competence Can Hinder Appropriate Reliance on AI Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581025,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581025,"
 The dazzling promises of AI systems to augment humans in various tasks hinge on whether humans can appropriately rely on them. Recent research has shown that appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team performance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an under-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people can hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive bias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and performance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of DKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be mitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI advice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user understanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their performance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal team performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either improving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate reliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users calibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among participants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can potentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated self-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to tackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI systems. Our findings advance the current understanding of the role of self-assessment in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI decision making. This lays out promising future directions for relevant HCI research in this community.

 Selecting a proper color palette is critical in crafting a high-quality graphic design to gain visibility and communicate ideas effectively. To facilitate this process, we propose De-Stijl, an intelligent and interactive color authoring tool to assist novice designers in crafting harmonic color palettes, achieving quick design iterations, and fulfilling design constraints. Through De-Stijl, we contribute a novel 2D color palette concept that allows users to intuitively perceive color designs in context with their proportions and proximities. Further, De-Stijl implements a holistic color authoring system that supports 2D palette extraction, theme-aware and spatial-sensitive color recommendation, and automatic graphical elements (re)colorization. We evaluated De-Stijl through an in-lab user study by comparing the system with existing industry standard tools, followed by in-depth user interviews. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that De-Stijl is effective in assisting novice design practitioners to quickly colorize graphic designs and easily deliver several alternatives.

HandAvatar leverages the high dexterity and coordination of users’ hands to control virtual avatars, enabled through our novel approach for automatically-generated joint-to-joint mappings. We contribute an observation study to understand users’ preferences on hand-to-avatar mappings on eight avatars. Leveraging insights from the study, we present an automated approach that generates mappings between users’ hands and arbitrary virtual avatars by jointly optimizing control precision, structural similarity, and comfort. We evaluated HandAvatar on static posing, dynamic animation, and creative exploration tasks. Results indicate that HandAvatar enables more precise control, requires less physical effort, and brings comparable embodiment compared to a state-of-the-art body-to-avatar control method. We demonstrate HandAvatar’s potential with applications including non-humanoid avatar based social interaction in VR, 3D animation composition, and VR scene design with physical proxies. We believe that HandAvatar unlocks new interaction opportunities, especially for usage in Virtual Reality, by letting users become the avatar in applications including virtual social interaction, animation, gaming, or education.

Less About Privacy: Revisiting a Survey about the German COVID-19 Contact Tracing App,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581537,0,,"
The release of COVID-19 contact tracing apps was accompanied by a heated public debate with much focus on privacy concerns, e.g., possible government surveillance. Many papers studied people’s intended behavior to research potential features and uptake of the apps. Studies in Germany conducted before the app’s release, such as that by Häring et al., showed that privacy was an important factor in the intention to install the app. We conducted a follow-up study two months post-release to investigate the intention-behavior-gap, see how attitudes changed after the release, and capture reported behavior. Analyzing a quota sample (n=837) for Germany, we found that fewer participants mentioned privacy concerns post-release, whereas utility now plays a greater role. We provide further evidence that the results of intention-based studies should be handled with care when used for prediction purposes.

 We aim to understand how people assess human likeness in navigation produced by people and artificially intelligent (AI) agents in a video game. To this end, we propose a novel AI agent with the goal of generating more human-like behavior. We collect hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments comparing the human-likeness of navigation behavior generated by our agent and baseline AI agents with human-generated behavior. Our proposed agent passes a Turing Test, while the baseline agents do not. By passing a Turing Test, we mean that human judges could not quantitatively distinguish between videos of a person and an AI agent navigating. To understand what people believe constitutes human-like navigation, we extensively analyze the justifications of these assessments. This work provides insights into the characteristics that people consider human-like in the context of goal-directed video game navigation, which is a key step for further improving human interactions with AI agents.

"MFS Design in Appstore-enabled Smart Featurephones for Low-literate, Marginalized Communities",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580661,0,,"
 Mobile Financial Services (MFS) has gained significant popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among marginalized and low-income, low-literate communities around the world. Such communities have not been traditionally considered while designing MFS services via smartphone apps or USSD services in featurephones. Financial constraints limit such end-users towards basic featurephones, where recent appstore support has made it possible to deploy app-based MFS solutions beyond USSD. This new featurephone platform is a relatively underexplored area in terms of addressing design issues related to aforementioned end-users while developing MFS solutions. Our work addresses this gap by presenting qualitative findings on barriers to technology access focused on MFS solutions in marginal communities. We present a prototype non-USSD, app-based solution on an appstore-supported featurephone platform designed via a human-centered approach. This work has the potential to increase the financial inclusivity of marginalized communities in cashless MFS transactions via low-cost, appstore-enabled featurephones.

 Latent vectors extracted by machine learning (ML) are widely used in data exploration (e.g., t-SNE) but suffer from a lack of interpretability. While previous studies employed disentangled representation learning (DRL) to enable more interpretable exploration, they often overlooked the potential mismatches between the concepts of humans and the semantic dimensions learned by DRL. To address this issue, we propose Drava, a visual analytics system that supports users in 1) relating the concepts of humans with the semantic dimensions of DRL and identifying mismatches, 2) providing feedback to minimize the mismatches, and 3) obtaining data insights from concept-driven exploration. Drava provides a set of visualizations and interactions based on visual piles to help users understand and refine concepts and conduct concept-driven exploration. Meanwhile, Drava employs a concept adaptor model to fine-tune the semantic dimensions of DRL based on user refinement. The usefulness of Drava is demonstrated through application scenarios and experimental validation.

Personal fabrication has mostly focused on handheld tools as embodied extensions of the user, and machines like laser cutters and 3D printers automating parts of the process without intervention. Although interactive digital fabrication has been explored as a middle ground, existing systems have a fixed allocation of user intervention vs. machine autonomy, limiting flexibility, creativity, and improvisation. We explore a new class of devices that combine the desirable properties of a handheld tool and an autonomous fabrication robot, offering a continuum from manual and assisted to autonomous fabrication, with seamless mode transitions. We exemplify the concept of mixed-initiative physical sketching with a working robotic printer that can be handheld for free-hand sketching, can provide interactive assistance during sketching, or move about for computer-generated sketches. We present interaction techniques to seamlessly transition between modes, and sketching techniques benefitting from these transitions to, e.g., extend (upscale, repeat) or revisit (refine, color) sketches. Our evaluation with seven sketchers illustrates that RoboSketch successfully leverages each mode’s strengths, and that mixed-initiative physical sketching makes computer-supported sketching more flexible.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in chronic sensorimotor, cognitive, psychosocial, and communication challenges that can limit social participation. Social media can be a useful outlet for social participation for individuals with TBI, but there are barriers to access. While research has drawn attention to the nature of access barriers, few studies have investigated technological solutions to address these barriers, particularly considering the perspectives of individuals with TBI. To address this gap in knowledge, we used a participatory approach to engage 10 adults with TBI in conceptualizing tools to address their challenges accessing Facebook. Participants described multifaceted challenges in using social media, including interface overload, social comparisons, and anxiety over self-presentation and communication after injury. They discussed their needs and preferences and generated ideas for design solutions. Our work contributes to designing assistive and accessibility technology to facilitate an equal access to the benefits of social media for individuals with TBI.

 Laser-cutting is a promising fabrication method that empowers makers, including blind or visually-impaired (BVI) creators, to create technologies that fit their needs.

Integrating BVI needs can enrich the greater maker community by enabling cross-group discourse on laser-cut making. To investigate how laser-cut model design can be more accessible overall, we study laser-cut assembly as a process deeply intertwined with the fundamental design of laser-cut models. We present a study with seven sighted and seven BVI participants to compare their usage of laser-cut model affordances during assembly. Data for the BVI participants in this study originate from a previous work [13]. We identify assembly cues common or unique to sighted and BVI users, and discuss implications to improve general accessibility in laser-cut design.

We create these electronics through three different methods: 1) by inkjet printing conductive silver traces on poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) substrates to create water-soluble sensors; 2) by mixing a conductive beeswax material configured as a meltable sensor; and 3) by fabricating edible electronics with 3D printed chocolate and culinary gold leaf. To enable practical applications of these devices, we implement a fully transient and sustainable chipless RF detection system.

 Artificially intelligent (AI) agents such as robots are increasingly delegated power in work settings, yet it remains unclear how power functions in interactions with both humans and robots, especially when they directly compete for influence. Here we present an experiment where every participant was matched with one human and one robot to perform decision-making tasks. By manipulating who has power, we created three conditions: human as leader, robot as leader, and a no-power-difference control. The results showed that the participants were significantly more influenced by the leader, regardless of whether the leader was a human or a robot. However, they generally held a more positive attitude toward the human than the robot, although they considered whichever was in power as more competent. This study illustrates the importance of power for future Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAI) research, as it addresses pressing concerns of society about AI-powered intelligent agents.

 Three state virtual keyboards which differentiate contact events between released, touched, and pressed states have the potential to improve overall typing experience and reduce the gap between virtual keyboards and physical keyboards. Incorporating force sensitivity, three-state virtual keyboards can utilize a force threshold to better classify a contact event. However, our limited knowledge of how force plays a role during typing on virtual keyboards limits further progress. Through a series of studies we observe that using a uniform threshold is not an optimal approach. Furthermore, the force being applied while typing varies significantly across the keys and among participants. As such, we propose three different approaches to further improve the uniform threshold. We show that a carefully selected non-uniform threshold function could be sufficient in delineating typing events on a three-state keyboard. Finally, we conclude our work with lessons learned, suggestion for future improvements, and comparisons with current methods available.

In a consecutive study (n=13), we compared FingerMapper to hand tracking inside a confined space (the front passenger seat of a car). The results showed participants had significantly higher perceived safety and fewer collisions with FingerMapper while preserving a similar degree of presence and enjoyment as hand tracking. Finally, we present three example applications demonstrating how FingerMapper could be applied for locomotion and interaction for VR in confined spaces.

To address the aforementioned challenges, ONYX provides suggestions on how ONYX could handle new NL inputs based on previously learned concepts or user-defined procedures, and poses follow-up questions to clarify ambiguities in user demonstrations, using visual and textual aids to clarify the connections. Our evaluation shows that users provided with ONYX’s new features achieved significantly higher accuracy in teaching new NL inputs (median: 93.3%) in contrast to those without (median: 73.3%).

 Adaptation, or ability and willingness to consider an alternative approach, is a critical component of learning through reflection, especially in educational games, where there are often multiple avenues to success. As a domain, educational games have shown increased interest in using retrospective visualizations to promote and support reflection. Such visualizations, which can facilitate comparison with peer data, may also have an impact on adaptation in educational games. This has, however, not been empirically examined within the domain. In this work, we examine how comparison with other players’ data influenced adaptation, a part of reflection, in the context of a game that teaches parallel programming. Our results indicate that comparison with peers does significantly impact willingness to try a different approach, but suggest that there may also be other ways. We discuss what these results mean for future use of retrospective visualizations in educational games and present opportunities for future work.

GestureExplorer: Immersive Visualisation and Exploration of Gesture Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580678,0,,"
This paper presents the design and evaluation of GestureExplorer, an Immersive Analytics tool that supports the interactive exploration, classification and sensemaking with large sets of 3D temporal gesture data. GestureExplorer features 3D skeletal and trajectory visualisations of gestures combined with abstract visualisations of clustered sets of gestures. By leveraging the large immersive space afforded by a Virtual Reality interface our tool allows free navigation and control of viewing perspective for users to gain a better understanding of gestures.  We explored a selection of classification methods to provide an overview of the dataset that was linked to a detailed view of the data that showed different visualisation modalities. We evaluated GestureExplorer with two user studies and collected feedback from participants with diverse visualisation and analytics backgrounds. Our results demonstrated the promising capability of GestureExplorer for providing a useful and engaging experience in exploring and analysing gesture data.

 We present ChameleonControl, a real-human teleoperation system for scalable remote instruction in hands-on classrooms. In contrast to existing video or AR/VR-based remote hands-on education, ChameleonControl uses a real human as a surrogate of a remote instructor. Building on existing human-based telepresence approaches, we contribute a novel method to teleoperate a human surrogate through synchronized mixed reality hand gestural navigation and verbal communication. By overlaying the remote instructor’s virtual hands in the local user’s MR view, the remote instructor can guide and control the local user as if they were physically present. This allows the local user/surrogate to synchronize their hand movements and gestures with the remote instructor, effectively teleoperating a real human. We deploy and evaluate our system in classrooms of physiotherapy training, as well as other application domains such as mechanical assembly, sign language and cooking lessons. The study results confirm that our approach can increase engagement and the sense of co-presence, showing potential for the future of remote hands-on classrooms.

Seeking Love and Companionship through Streaming: Unpacking Livestreamer-moderated Senior Matchmaking in China,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581195,0,https://hechangyang.com/papers/CHI23_matchmaking.pdf,"
Livestreamer-moderated matchmaking has gained wide popularity among the elderly population in China. Compared to algorithm-mediated online dating, it is characterized by (1) the mediation of matchmakers in a synchronous virtual environment and (2) the natural development of livestreaming-based matchmaking communities. Nonetheless, how these new features influence single seniors’ match-seeking remains unknown. To fill this research gap, we conduct a qualitative study consisting of observations and semi-structured interviews with 6 livestreaming matchmakers and 12 senior match-seekers (age: 50-70). We uncover matchmakers’ mediation roles during and beyond livestreaming to facilitate seniors’ match-seeking, and their additional duties to enhance seniors’ safety in this process. Livestreaming-based matchmaking communities afford multiple important values for single seniors to acquire companionship and help in seeking late-life love. We unpack the perceived benefits and challenges of livestreamer-moderated matchmaking, and discuss how to support single seniors’ match-seeking in an accessible, safe, and convenient manner.

 The development of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) has created a novel job, the safety driver, recruited from experienced drivers to supervise and operate AV in numerous driving missions. Safety drivers usually work with non-perfect AV in high-risk real-world traffic environments for road testing tasks. However, this group of workers is under-explored in the HCI community. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 safety drivers. Our results present how safety drivers cope with defective algorithms and shape and calibrate their perceptions while working with AV. We found that, as front-line workers, safety drivers are forced to take risks accumulated from the AV industry upstream and are also confronting restricted self-development in working for AV development. We contribute the first empirical evidence of the lived experience of safety drivers, the first passengers in the development of AV, and also the grassroots workers for AV, which can shed light on future human-AI interaction research.

 Videos are commonly used to support learning of new skills, to improve existing skills, and as a source of motivation for training. Video self-modelling (VSM) is a learning technique that improves performance and motivation by showing a user a video of themselves performing a skill at a level they have not yet achieved. Traditional VSM is very data and labour intensive: a lot of video footage needs to be collected and manually edited in order to create an effective self-modelling video. We address this by presenting FakeForward – a method which uses deepfakes to create self-modelling videos from videos of other people. FakeForward turns videos of better-performing people into effective, personalised training tools by replacing their face with the user’s. We investigate how FakeForward can be effectively applied and demonstrate its efficacy in rapidly improving performance in physical exercises, as well as confidence and perceived competence in public speaking.

“Together but not together”: Evaluating Typing Indicators for Interaction-Rich Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581248,0,https://zainabiftikhar.com/papers/LiveTyping_CHI23.pdf,"
Messaging is a ubiquitous digital communication medium. It is also a minimal medium of communication because of its inability to convey immediate feedback, tone, facial expressions, hesitations, and pauses, or follow the train of the other person’s thoughts. This paper combines quantitative and qualitative approaches for analyzing richer forms of typing indicators in messaging interfaces, such as showing text as it is typed. By assessing users’ subjective workload and interpreting these findings in the context of users’ experiences, we found that more expressive typing indicators were perceived as “rich in communication”, as they helped people communicate more allowing for closer connections. These indicators also increased users’ perceived co-presence. In addition, our research suggests there may be benefits of designing customized typing indicators for relationship maintenance and task-based communication.

The understanding of multi-level spatial topologies is a difficult and frequent challenge in people with visual impairments daily life, impacting their independent mobility. Using the tools of the “maker” movement, and following an iterative co-design process with Orientation and Mobility instructors, we created an innovative tool (3D printed interactive model of a train station) for teaching complex spatial knowledge. Then, we did a comparative study with end users between the 3D interactive model that we designed and two 2D interactive tactile maps representing the same location. Our results show that the 3D interactive model is useful and usable, provides better satisfaction and is preferred to 2D tactile maps. In addition, complex spatial notions are better understood with the 3D model. Altogether, these results suggest that the “maker movement” may empower special education teachers with adapted and innovative tools.

Whether a programmer with code or a potter with clay, practitioners engage in an ongoing process of working and reasoning with materials. Existing discussions in HCI have provided rich accounts of these practices and processes, which we synthesize into three themes: (1) reciprocal discovery of goals and materials, (2) local knowledge of materials, and (3) annotation for holistic interpretation. We then apply these design principles generatively to the domain of version control to present Quickpose: a version control system for creative coding. In an in-situ, longitudinal study of Quickpose guided by our themes, we collected usage data, version history, and interviews. Our study explored our participants’ material interaction behaviors and the initial promise of our proposed measures for recognizing these behaviors. Quickpose is an exploration of version control as material interaction, using existing discussions to inform domain-specific concepts, measures, and designs for version control systems.

Defining and Identifying Attention Capture Deceptive Designs in Digital Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580729,0,,"
 Many tech companies exploit psychological vulnerabilities to design digital interfaces that maximize the frequency and duration of user visits. Consequently, users often report feeling dissatisfied with time spent on such services. Prior work has developed typologies of damaging design patterns (or dark patterns) that contribute to financial and privacy harms, which has helped designers to resist these patterns and policymakers to regulate them. However, we are missing a collection of similar problematic patterns that lead to attentional harms. To close this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review for what we call ‘attention capture damaging patterns’ (ACDPs). We analyzed 43 papers to identify their characteristics, the psychological vulnerabilities they exploit, and their impact on digital wellbeing. We propose a definition of ACDPs and identify eleven common types, from Time Fog to Infinite Scroll. Our typology offers technologists and policymakers a common reference to advocate, design, and regulate against attentional harms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can cause harm to people. This research examines how individuals react to such harm through the lens of blame. Building upon research suggesting that people blame AI systems, we investigated how several factors influence people’s reactive attitudes towards machines, designers, and users. The results of three studies (N = 1,153) indicate differences in how blame is attributed to these actors. Whether AI systems were explainable did not impact blame directed at them, their developers, and their users. Considerations about fairness and harmfulness increased blame towards designers and users but had little to no effect on judgments of AI systems. Instead, what determined people’s reactive attitudes towards machines was whether people thought blaming them would be a suitable response to algorithmic harm. We discuss implications, such as how future decisions about including AI systems in the social and moral spheres will shape laypeople’s reactions to AI-caused harm.

 Editing (e.g., editing conceptual diagrams) is a typical office task that requires numerous tedious GUI operations, resulting in poor interaction efficiency and user experience, especially on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a new type of human-computer collaborative editing tool (CET) that enables accurate and efficient editing with little interaction effort. CET divides the task into two parts, and the human and the computer focus on their respective specialties: the human describes high-level editing goals with multimodal commands, while the computer calculates, recommends, and performs detailed operations. We conducted a formative study (N = 16) to determine the concrete task division and implemented the tool on Android devices for the specific tasks of editing concept diagrams. The user study (N = 24 + 20) showed that it increased diagram editing speed by 32.75% compared with existing state-of-the-art commercial tools and led to better editing results and user experience.

Grounded in seventeen interviews with blind weavers and sighted instructors, we built Simphony, an audio-tactile system that aims to support blind weavers in creating and perceiving patterns. Findings from eight design exploration sessions at the community studio reveal how blind weavers used Simphony to learn the process of pattern design and generate patterns with sighted instructors. We reflect on collaborative understanding of pattern design among blind and sighted individuals and discuss opportunities for integrating technological augmentations into traditional craftwork.

Automatic Improper Loading Posture Detection and Correction Utilizing Electrical Muscle Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581435,0,,"
 Chronic lower back pain due to improper lifting techniques poses a major workplace safety hazard. The major risk factors for improper loading posture (ILP) include overloading, and improper loading of the lumbar muscles, ligaments, and vertebrae due to repetitive mechanical stresses exerted upon them. The current intervention technology relies on the users’ intent and willingness to self-correct ILP through alert-based feedback or involves wearing bulky lift assist devices to prevent ILP. We address these issues with a physiological feedback system that utilizes IMU sensors for ILP detection and Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for automatic dynamic ILP correction for restoring ideal lifting angles for torso inclination and knee bend. In a user study involving 36 participants, our automatic approach delivered significantly faster correction and outperformed alternative feedback mechanisms (Audio and Vibro-tactile) and was perceived to be interesting, comfortable and a potential commercial product.

 Fingertip force control plays an important role in learning motor skills. Exoskeleton gloves have been developed to assist with fingertip force control, but having the equipment on the fingers interferes with finger motion control and tactile sensation. Thus, we present a system for assisting with voluntary fingertip force control that does not require any devices to be worn on the fingers. In this study, we focused particularly on lateral pinch force, which is grip force achieved with the pad of the thumb and the lateral surface of the index finger to grasp objects. We use active bio-acoustic sensing to estimate voluntary pinch force with piezo elements attached to the back of the hand and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to the forearm to control involuntary pinch force in a closed-loop system. We developed three prototypes and conducted user studies to investigate whether our system can assist with pinch force control under several target forces, from weak to strong. Our user studies showed that the combination of active bio-acoustic sensing and EMS can assist users in maintaining the pinch force closer to the target force.

Do people trust social media? If so, why, in what contexts, and how does that trust impact their lives? Researchers, companies, and journalists alike have increasingly investigated these questions, which are fundamental to understanding social media interactions and their implications for society. However, trust in social media is a complex concept, and there is conflicting evidence about the antecedents and implications of trusting social media content, users, and platforms. More problematic is that we lack basic agreement as to what trust means in the context of social media. Addressing these challenges, we conducted a systematic review to identify themes and challenges in this field. Through our analysis of 70 papers, we contribute a synthesis of how trust in social media is defined, conceptualized, and measured, a summary of trust antecedents in social media, an understanding of how trust in social media impacts behaviors and attitudes, and directions for future work.

A central problem for chatbots in the customer care domain revolves around how people collaborate with the agent to achieve their own situated goals. The majority of the previous research, however, relied on experiments within artificial settings, rather than on observation of real-world interactions. Moreover, such research mostly analyzed users’ responses to communication breakdowns, rather than the wider collaboration strategies utilized during a conversation. In this paper, we qualitatively analyzed 12,477 real-world exchanges with a task-based chatbot using a Grounded Theory approach as a rigorous coding method to analyze the data. We identified two main aspects of collaboration, behavioral and conversational, and for each aspect we highlighted the different strategies that users perform to “work together” with the agent. These strategies may be utilized from the very beginning of the conversation or in response to misunderstandings in the course of ongoing interactions and may show different evolving dynamics.

Technology interactions found their way into public space and present others attend what users are doing. However, in HCI research, the attendant perspective has often been neglected or considered only vaguely in the sense of “social context”. Aiming at a better understanding of different types of attendants and their experiences, we developed a typology of four types based on two differentiating criteria (conspicuousness and voluntariness of attending the user interaction). An experimental vignette study (N = 181) tested the typology and revealed typical experiential patterns (e.g., need fulfillment, emotions, desire to join the technology interaction) related to the four types based on quantitative and qualitative data. Our research provides various contributions to HCI theory and design. For example, the typology can be used analytically in UX research. Moreover, it can be used generatively to design positive technology experiences in public for all stakeholders, namely, users and attendants.

Data visualizations are vital to scientific communication on critical issues such as public health, climate change, and socioeconomic policy. They are often designed not just to inform, but to persuade people to make consequential decisions (e.g., to get vaccinated). Are such visualizations persuasive, especially when audiences have beliefs and attitudes that the data contradict? In this paper we examine the impact of existing attitudes (e.g., positive or negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination) on changes in beliefs about statistical correlations when viewing scatterplot visualizations with different representations of statistical uncertainty. We find that strong prior attitudes are associated with smaller belief changes when presented with data that contradicts existing views, and that visual uncertainty representations may amplify this effect. Finally, even when participants’ beliefs about correlations shifted their attitudes remained unchanged, highlighting the need for further research on whether data visualizations can drive longer-term changes in views and behavior.

In low-and middle-income countries like India, people with severe mental illness (PSMI) rely on their families as a primary source of care, given the lack of support from healthcare systems.

We explore how caregivers in under-resourced settings can be better supported through everyday digital technologies. We conducted interviews with caregivers (from urban and rural India), as well as workshops with professionals from Indian NGOs that work directly with PSMIs. We found that technology has the potential to (1) provide carer-centred support that empowers carers who experience stigma and issues with existing support networks; (2) provide support for carers to overcome barriers and progress in the recovery of the PSMI. We conclude with design considerations, proposing how an online peer community can leverage carers’ expertise to actualise support provision.

 A common research process in visualization is for visualization researchers to collaborate with domain experts to solve particular applied data problems. While there is existing guidance and expertise around how to structure collaborations to strengthen research contributions, there is comparatively little guidance on how to navigate the implications of, and power produced through the socio-technical entanglements of collaborations. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze reflective interviews of past participants of collaborations from multiple perspectives: visualization graduate students, visualization professors, and domain collaborators. We juxtapose the perspectives of these individuals, revealing tensions about the tools that are built and the relationships that are formed — a complex web of competing motivations. Through the lens of matters of care, we interpret this web, concluding with considerations that both trouble and necessitate reformation of current patterns around collaborative work in visualization design studies to promote more equitable, useful, and care-ful outcomes.

 Gestures performed accompanying the voice are essential for voice interaction to convey complementary semantics for interaction purposes such as wake-up state and input modality. In this paper, we investigated voice-accompanying hand-to-face (VAHF) gestures for voice interaction. We targeted on hand-to-face gestures because such gestures relate closely to speech and yield significant acoustic features (e.g., impeding voice propagation). We conducted a user study to explore the design space of VAHF gestures, where we first gathered candidate gestures and then applied a structural analysis to them in different dimensions (e.g., contact position and type), outputting a total of 8 VAHF gestures with good usability and least confusion. To facilitate VAHF gesture recognition, we proposed a novel cross-device sensing method that leverages heterogeneous channels (vocal, ultrasound, and IMU) of data from commodity devices (earbuds, watches, and rings). Our recognition model achieved an accuracy of 97.3% for recognizing 3 gestures and 91.5% for recognizing 8 gestures (excluding the ""empty"" gesture), proving the high applicability. Quantitative analysis also shed light on the recognition capability of each sensor channel and their different combinations. In the end, we illustrated the feasible use cases and their design principles to demonstrate the applicability of our system in various scenarios.

Information asymmetries create extractive, often harmful relationships between platform workers (e.g., Uber or Deliveroo drivers) and their algorithmic managers. Recent HCI studies have put forward more equitable platform designs but leave open questions about the social and technical infrastructures required to support them without the cooperation of platforms. We conducted a participatory design study in which platform workers deconstructed and re-imagined Uber’s schema for driver data. We analyzed the data structures and social institutions participants proposed, focusing on the stakeholders, roles, and strategies for mitigating conflicting interests of privacy, personal agency, and utility. Using critical theory, we reflected on the capability of participatory design to generate bottom-up collective data infrastructures. Based on the plurality of alternative institutions participants produced and their aptitude to navigate data stewardship decisions, we propose user-configurable tools for lightweight data institution building, as an alternative to redesigning existing platforms or delegating control to centralized trusts.

Phone Sleight of Hand: Finger-Based Dexterous Gestures for Physical Interaction with Mobile Phones,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581121,0,http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/~fdmmatul/pubs/CHI2023.pdf,"
We identify and evaluate single-handed “dexterous gestures” to physically manipulate a phone using the fine motor skills of fingers. Four manipulations are defined: shift, spin (yaw axis), rotate (roll axis) and flip (pitch axis), with a formative survey showing all except flip have been performed for various reasons. A controlled experiment examines the speed, behaviour, and preference of manipulations in the form of dexterous gestures, by considering two directions and two movement magnitudes. Results show rotate is rated as easiest and most comfortable, while flip is rated lowest. Using a heuristic recognizer for spin, rotate, and flip, a one-week usability experiment finds increased practice and familiarity improve the speed and comfort of dexterous gestures. Design guidelines are developed to consider comfort, ability, and confidence when mapping dexterous gestures to interactions, and demonstrations show how such gestures can be used in smartphone applications.

Investigating Eyes-away Mid-air Typing in Virtual Reality using Squeeze haptics-based Postural Reinforcement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581467,0,,"
 In this paper, we investigate postural reinforcement haptics for mid-air typing using squeeze actuation on the wrist. We propose and validate eye-tracking based objective metrics that capture the impact of haptics on the user’s experience, which traditional performance metrics like speed and accuracy are not able to capture. To this end, we design four wrist-based haptic feedback conditions: no haptics, vibrations on keypress, squeeze+vibrations on keypress, and squeeze posture reinforcement + vibrations on keypress. We conduct a text input study with 48 participants to compare the four conditions on typing and gaze metrics. Our results show that for expert qwerty users, posture reinforcement haptics significantly benefit typing by reducing the visual attention on the keyboard by up to 44% relative to no haptics, thus enabling eyes-away behaviors.

MathKingdom: Teaching Children Mathematical Language Through Speaking at Home via a Voice-Guided Game,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581043,0,,"
 The amount and quality of mathematical language in the family are positively associated with promoting children’s mathematical abilities. However, mathematical language in many families is poor. Through need-finding investigation, we developed MathKingdom, a voice-agent-based game that helps children aged 4–7 learn and use rich, accurate mathematical language (e.g., mathematical expressions related to measurement, sequence, patterns). The game has four flows, in which users can wake up, transform, decorate, and perform as their avatars, as well as practice basic mathematical vocabulary, mathematical single sentences, coherent mathematical statements, and free expression. We refined the system design through wizard-of-oz testing and then evaluated it with 18 families. The results showed that MathKingdom effectively engaged children, enhanced their mathematical language skills and mathematical abilities, and encouraged parent-child conversations about math.

Escapement: A Tool for Interactive Prototyping with Video via Sensor-Mediated Abstraction of Time,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581115,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581115,"
 We present Escapement, a video prototyping tool that introduces a powerful new concept for prototyping screen-based interfaces by flexibly mapping sensor values to dynamic playback control of videos. This recasts the time dimension of video mock-ups as sensor-mediated interaction.  This abstraction of time as interaction, which we dub video-escapement prototyping, empowers designers to rapidly explore and viscerally experience direct touch or sensor-mediated interactions across one or more device displays. Our system affords cross-device and bidirectional remote (tele-present) experiences via cloud-based state sharing across multiple devices. This makes Escapement especially potent for exploring multi-device, dual-screen, or remote-work interactions for screen-based applications.  We introduce the core concept of sensor-mediated abstraction of time for quickly generating video-based interactive prototypes of screen-based applications, share the results of observations of long-term usage of video-escapement techniques with experienced interaction designers, and articulate design choices for supporting a reflective, iterative, and open-ended creative design process.

 Media architecture exploits interactive technology to encourage passers-by to engage with an architectural environment. Whereas most media architecture installations focus on visual stimulation, we developed a permanent media facade that rhythmically knocks xylophone blocks embedded beneath 11 window sills, according to the human actions constantly traced via an overhead camera. In an attempt to overcome its apparent limitations in engaging passers-by more enduringly and purposefully, our study investigates the impact of feedforward learning, a constructive interaction method that instructs passers-by about the results of their actions. Based on a comparative (n=25) and a one-month in-the-wild (n=1877) study, we propose how feedforward learning could empower passers-by to understand the interaction of more abstract types of media architecture, and how particular quantitative indicators capturing this learning could predict how enduringly and purposefully a passer-might engage. We believe these contributions could inspire more creative integrations of non-visual modalities in future public interactive interventions.

A future goal overarching the initial findings in this paper is to design technologically mediated, physical spaces (DivComp Spaces) within a school context where children meet, experiment and learn the complex dynamics of othering. We report on a series of nine workshops with 48 children. Based on a thematic analysis, we present four themes — Technology as Utility and Authority, Individual and Collective Place-Making, Staged and Emerging Conflicts, Belonging to the Group and Self-Expression — which we use to inform three design directions for developing DivComp Spaces specifically in the context of school. Finally, we critically reflect on our design practice and the difficulties of designing not only for, but also with diversity meaningfully embedded into design processes.

 The scope of Sustainable HCI research is expanding to include the broad sociotechnical and ecological contexts of computing. We examine the intersection of environmental sustainability, technology, and the law. By studying the legal dispute between a platform service that facilitates crowd-sourced waste disposal and the local government’s regulation of waste management, we step through an evolving debate on the meaning of care and responsibility for the environment. When faced with the municipality’s claimed monopoly on responsibility for waste management, the platform argues for the paradigms of individual responsibility, designing for user needs, and personalised and on-demand digital services. In arguing against this framing, the municipality highlights the gap between the law, its interpretation, and the idealistic values of technology-driven environmental care. We contribute to the framing of environmental care within Sustainable HCI as a locally constructed, regulated, and contested aspect of technology design and appropriation.

Survivor-Centered Transformative Justice: An Approach to Designing Alongside Domestic Violence Stakeholders in US Muslim Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580648,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00172,"
 While domestic violence (DV) is prevalent in all socioeconomic settings, identity highly impacts how one experiences and recovers from abuse. This work examines US-based Muslim women’s challenges when seeking help and healing from domestic violence. Through participatory interviews with 23 participants within the DV ecosystem, we find that victim-survivors’ autonomy is compromised throughout the abuse, within their immediate communities, and when involving the criminal justice system. To address such harms, we adapt a survivor-centered transformative justice (SCTJ) approach, a framework to discern individual and systemic harm, to understand how to design alongside victim-survivors, and to focus on victim-survivors’ autonomy. We explain under what conditions an SCTJ approach may be productive for designers. We use insights from our interviews to highlight intervention areas for reducing harm, repairing harm, and promoting healing for victim-survivors. Lastly, we offer guidelines to design for harm reduction, accountability, and systemic change.

For decades, research around emerging technologies has been inspired by science fiction and vice versa. While so far almost only the technologies themselves have been considered, we explore the underlying software development and programming approaches. We therefore conduct a detailed media content analysis of twenty-seven movies that examines the role of software development in science fiction by identifying and investigating new approaches to programming and how software development is conceptualized portrayed within science fiction scenes. With the additional analysis of eighteen design fiction stories exploring the scenario “What if everyone is able to program?”, we envision potential impacts of the democratization of software development on business and society. Our study opens new discussions and perspectives, by investigating the current vision of the future of programming and uncovers new approaches to software development which can serve as a starting point for further research in the HCI community.

Profile pictures can convey rich social signals that are often inaccessible to blind and low vision screen reader users. Although there have been efforts to understand screen reader users’ preferences for alternative (alt) text descriptions when encountering images online, profile pictures evoke distinct information needs. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 screen reader users to understand their preferences for various styles of profile picture image descriptions in different social contexts. We also interviewed seven sighted individuals to explore their thoughts on authoring alt text for profile pictures. Our findings suggest that detailed image descriptions and user narrated alt text can provide screen reader users enjoyable and informative experiences when exploring profile pictures. We also identified mismatches between how sighted individuals would author alt text with what screen reader users prefer to know about profile pictures. We discuss the implications of our findings for social applications that support profile pictures.

Our results show that older adults (1) are motivated to learn practical topics, leading to less consumption of STEM domains than non-older adults, (2) watch videos with less interaction and watch a larger portion of a single video compared to non-older adults, and (3) face various difficulties (e.g., inconvenience arisen due to their unfamiliarity with technologies) that limit their learning through online videos.

Dark patterns are deceptive and malicious properties of user interfaces that lead the end-user to do something different from intended or expected. While now a key topic in critical computing, most work has been conducted in Western contexts. Japan, with its booming app market, is a relatively uncharted context that offers culturally- and linguistically-sensitive differences in design standards, contexts of use, values, and language, all of which could influence the presence and expression of dark patterns. In this work, we analyzed 200 popular mobile apps in the Japanese market. We found that most apps had dark patterns, with an average of 3.9 per app. We also identified a new class of dark pattern: “Linguistic Dead-Ends” in the forms of “Untranslation” and “Alphabet Soup.” We outline the implications for design and research practice, especially for future cross-cultural research on dark patterns.

 Text entry on tablet touchscreens is a basic need nowadays. Tablet keyboards require visual attention for users to locate keys, thus not supporting efficient touch typing. They also take up a large proportion of screen space, which affects the access to information. To solve these problems, we propose ResType, an adaptive and invisible keyboard on three-state touch surfaces (e.g. tablets with unintentional touch prevention). ResType allows users to rest their hands on it and automatically adapts the keyboard to the resting fingers. Thus, users do not need visual attention to locate keys, which supports touch typing. We quantitatively explored users’ resting finger patterns on ResType, based on which we proposed an augmented Bayesian decoding algorithm for ResType, with 96.3% top-1 and 99.0% top-3 accuracies. After a 5-day evaluation, ResType achieved 41.26 WPM, outperforming normal tablet keyboards by 13.5% and reaching 86.7% of physical keyboards. It solves the occlusion problem while maintaining comparable typing speed with current methods on visible tablet keyboards.

Virtual Reality (VR) exergames can increase engagement in and motivation for physical activities. Most VR exergames focus on the upper body because many VR setups only track the users’ heads and hands. To become a serious alternative to existing exercise programs, VR exergames must provide a balanced workout and train the lower limbs, too. To address this issue, we built a VR exergame focused on vertical jump training to explore full-body exercise applications. To create a safe and effective training, nine domain experts participated in our prototype design. Our mixed-methods study confirms that the jump-centered exercises provided a worthy challenge and positive player experience, indicating long-term retention. Based on our findings, we present five design implications to guide future work: avoid an unintended forward drift, consider technical constraints, address safety concerns in full-body VR exergames, incorporate rhythmic elements with fluent movement patterns, adapt difficulty to players’ fitness progression status.

 Gestures drawn on touchscreens have been proposed as an authentication method to secure access to smartphones. They provide good usability and a theoretically large password space. However, recent work has demonstrated that users tend to select simple or similar gestures as their passwords, rendering them susceptible to dictionary based guessing attacks. To improve their security, this paper describes a novel gesture password strength meter that interactively provides security assessments and improvement suggestions based on a scoring algorithm that combines a probabilistic model, a gesture dictionary, and a set of novel stroke heuristics. We evaluate this system in both online and offline settings and show it supports creation of gestures that are significantly more resistant to guessing attacks (by up to 67%) while also maintaining performance on usability metrics such as recall success rate and time. We conclude that gesture password strength meters can help users select more secure gesture passwords.

The Nuanced Nature of Trust and Privacy Control Adoption in the Context of Google,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581387,0,,"
 This paper investigates how trust towards service providers and the adoption of privacy controls belonging to two specific purposes (control over “sharing” vs. “usage” of data) vary based on users’ technical literacy. Towards that, we chose Google as the context and conducted an online survey across 209 Google users. Our results suggest that integrity and benevolence perceptions toward Google are significantly lower among technical participants than non-technical participants. While trust perceptions differ between non-technical adopters and non-adopters of privacy controls, no such difference is found among the technical counterparts. Notably, among the non-technical participants, the direction of trust affecting privacy control adoption is observed to be reversed based on the purpose of the controls. Using qualitative analysis, we extract trust-enhancing and dampening factors contributing to users’ trusting beliefs towards Google’s protection of user privacy. The implications of our findings for the design and promotion of privacy controls are discussed in the paper.

 Online fitness video tutorials are an increasingly popular way to stay fit at home without a personal trainer. However, to keep the screen playing the video in view, users typically disrupt their balance and break the motion flow — two main pillars for the correct execution of yoga poses. While past research partially addressed this problem, these approaches supported only a limited view of the instructor and simple movements. To enable the fluid execution of complex full-body yoga exercises, we propose FlowAR, an augmented reality system for home workouts that shows training video tutorials as always-present virtual static and dynamic overlays around the user. We tested different overlay layouts in a study with 16 participants, using motion capture equipment for baseline performance. Then, we iterated the prototype and tested it in a furnished lab simulating home settings with 12 users. Our results highlight the advantages of different visualizations and the system’s general applicability.

 Challenge is the core element of digital games. The wide spectrum of physical, cognitive, and emotional challenge experiences provided by modern digital games can be evaluated subjectively using a questionnaire, the CORGIS, which allows for a post hoc evaluation of the overall experience that occurred during game play. Measuring this experience dynamically and objectively, however, would allow for a more holistic view of the moment-to-moment experiences of players. This study, therefore, explored the potential of detecting perceived challenge from physiological signals. For this, we collected physiological responses from 32 players who engaged in three typical game scenarios. Using perceived challenge ratings from players and extracted physiological features, we applied multiple machine learning methods and metrics to detect challenge experiences. Results show that most methods achieved a detection accuracy of around 80%. We discuss in-game challenge perception, challenge-related physiological indicators and AI-supported challenge detection to inform future work on challenge evaluation.

In Study II, 40 new users rated pairwise similarities for 14 Tactons representing different metaphors (e.g., heartbeat). They also rated the Tactons’ match to the metaphors. In both studies, the resulting similarities and perceptual spaces strongly correlated in the lab and crowdsourced settings. Furthermore, 60% of the metaphor ratings were statistically equivalent in the two settings. We discuss the results and outline directions for future work on haptic crowdsourcing.

 Presentation slides commonly use visual patterns for structural navigation, such as titles, dividers, and build slides.

Slide Gestalt computes the visual and textual correspondences between slides to generate hierarchical groupings. Readers can navigate the slide deck from the higher-level section overview to the lower-level description of a slide group or individual elements interactively with our UI. We derived side consumption and authoring practices from interviews with BVI readers and sighted creators and an analysis of 100 decks. We performed our pipeline with 50 real-world slide decks and a large dataset. Feedback from eight BVI participants showed that Slide Gestalt helped navigate a slide deck by anchoring content more efficiently, compared to using accessible slides.

Chord and Sankey diagrams are two common techniques for visualizing flows. Chord diagrams use a radial layout with a single circular axis, and Sankey diagrams use a left-to-right layout with two vertical axes. Previous work suggests both strengths and weaknesses of the radial approach, but little is known about the usability and interpretability of these two layout styles for showing flow. We carried out a study where participants answered questions using equivalent Chord and Sankey diagrams. We measured completion time, errors, perceived effort, and preference. Our results show that participants took substantially longer to answer questions with Chord diagrams and made more errors; participants also rated Chord as requiring more effort, and strongly preferred Sankey diagrams. Our study identifies and explains limitations of the popular Chord layout, provides new understanding about radial vs. linear layouts that can help guide visualization designers, and identifies possible design improvements for both visualization types.

Procedural functionality enables visual creators to rapidly edit, explore alternatives, and fine-tune artwork in many domains including illustration, motion graphics, and interactive animation. Symbolic procedural tools, such as textual programming languages, are highly expressive but often limit directly manipulating concrete artwork; whereas direct manipulation tools support some procedural expression but limit creators to pre-defined behaviors and inputs. Inspired by visions of using geometric input to create procedural relationships, we identify an opportunity to use vector geometry from artwork to specify expressive user-defined procedural functions. We present Drawing Transforms (DTs), a technique that enables the use of any drawing to procedurally transform the stylistic, spatial, and temporal properties of target artwork. We apply DTs in a prototype motion graphics system to author continuous and discrete transformations, modify multiple elements in a composition simultaneously, create animations, and control fine-grained procedural instantiation. We discuss how DTs can unify procedural authoring through direct manipulation across visual media domains.

Within participant responses we identified dynamic tensions between denial and speculation, thinking and feeling, interaction and experience, control and independence, and rigidity and spontaneity. These tensions can inform future research into perceptions of machine consciousness and the challenges it represents for HCI. With both empirical and theoretical contributions, this paper emphasises the importance of HCI in an era of machine consciousness, real, perceived or denied.

ParaGlassMenu: Towards Social-Friendly Subtle Interactions in Conversations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581065,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581065,"
Interactions with digital devices during social settings can reduce social engagement and interrupt conversations. To overcome these drawbacks, we designed ParaGlassMenu, a semi-transparent circular menu that can be displayed around a conversation partner’s face on Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display (OHMD) and interacted subtly using a ring mouse. We evaluated ParaGlassMenu with several alternative approaches (Smartphone, Voice assistant, and Linear OHMD menus) by manipulating Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in a simulated conversation setting with a digital partner. Results indicated that the ParaGlassMenu offered the best overall performance in balancing social engagement and digital interaction needs in conversations. To validate these findings, we conducted a second study in a realistic conversation scenario involving commodity IoT devices. Results confirmed the utility and social acceptance of the ParaGlassMenu. Based on the results, we discuss implications for designing attention-maintaining subtle interaction techniques on OHMDs.

PointShopAR: Supporting Environmental Design Prototyping Using Point Cloud in Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580776,0,https://graphics.cs.yale.edu/sites/default/files/chi23-139.pdf,"
 We present PointShopAR, a novel tablet-based system for AR environmental design using point clouds as the underlying representation. It integrates point cloud capture and editing in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in their spatial context. We hypothesize that point clouds are well suited for prototyping, as they can be captured more rapidly than textured meshes and then edited immediately in situ on the capturing device. We based the design of PointShopAR on the practical needs of six architects in a formative study. Our system supports a variety of point cloud editing operations in AR, including selection, transformation, hole filling, drawing, morphing, and animation. We evaluate PointShopAR through a remote study on usability and an in-person study on environmental design support. Participants were able to iterate design rapidly, showing the merits of an integrated capture and editing workflow with point clouds in AR environmental design.

Investigating an Equity-based Participatory Approach to Technology-rich Learning in Community Recreation Centers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581567,0,https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/28032/3544548.3581567.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"
Understanding how to design and implement equity-based approaches to technology-rich learning can lead to increased and diversified participation in computing. Do-it-yourself (DIY) and maker approaches to interactive technology learning have been hailed as potential equalizers of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education for underserved youth, a narrative challenged by scholarship that has shown that if not designed carefully, making can be exclusionary and hegemonic. Equity-based approaches to making have identified the crucial role of community educators to prioritize community assets and learner participation. We studied educators’ strategies and youth outcomes in four afterschool maker programs in urban recreation centers. Community educators used several equity-based strategies to engage youth that included: identifying their interests through direct conversation and indirect signaling, customizing program activities to respond to interests, and encouraging self-expression and authenticity. These strategies led to increased social connections among youth, and increased technology self-efficacy and project ownership.

FeelTheNews: Augmenting Affective Perceptions of News Videos with Thermal and Vibrotactile Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585638,1,,"
Emotion plays a key role in the emerging wave of immersive, multi-sensory audience news engagement experiences. Since emotions can be triggered by somatosensory feedback, in this work we explore how augmenting news video watching with haptics can influence affective perceptions of news. Using a mixed-methods approach, we design and evaluate FeelTheNews, a prototype that combines vibrotactile and thermal stimulation (Matching, 70Hz/20° C, 200Hz/40° C) during news video watching. In a within-subjects study (N=20), we investigate the effects of haptic stimulation and video valence on perceived valence, emotion intensity, comfort, and overall haptic experiences. Findings showed: (a) news valence and emotion intensity ratings were not affected by haptics, (b) no stimulation was more comfortable than including stimulation, (c) attention and engagement with the news can override haptic sensations, and (d) users’ perceived agency over their reactions is critical to avoid distrust. We contribute cautionary insights for haptic augmentation of the news watching experience.

Impacts of the Strength and Conformity of Social Norms on Well-Being: A Mixed-Method Study Among Hybrid Workers in Japan,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581383,0,http://naomi-yamashita.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023jp-02.pdf,"
 Previous studies have suggested that organizational social norms can positively affect employee well-being. However, such social norms have not been well developed during the post-COVID-19 transition to hybrid work, which combines office and remote work, and it is unclear how employees’ perceptions of social norms for hybrid work affect their well-being. In this study, we investigated the impact of social norms for hybrid work on the well-being of hybrid workers living in Japan through a mixed-method approach consisting of an online survey (n = 212) and semi-structured interviews (n = 20). The results indicate that hybrid workers who feel subject to strong social norms have lower well-being. Conversely, those who are more willing to conform to social norms have higher well-being. Given our findings, we discuss implications for the design of systems to help hybrid workers conform to organizational social norms and to improve their well-being.

CoilCAM: Enabling Parametric Design for Clay 3D Printing Through an Action-Oriented Toolpath Programming System,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580745,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580745,"
Clay 3D printing provides the benefits of digital fabrication automation and reconfigurability through a method that evokes manual clay coiling. Existing design technologies for clay 3D printing reflect the general 3D printing workflow in which solid forms are designed in CAD and then converted into a toolpath. In contrast, in hand-coiling, form is determined by the actions taken by the artist’s hands through space in response to the material. We theorized that an action-oriented approach for clay 3D printing could allow creators to design digital fabrication toolpaths that reflect clay material properties. We present CoilCAM, a domain-specific CAM programming system that supports the integrated generation of parametric forms and surface textures through mathematically defined toolpath operations. We developed CoilCAM in collaboration with ceramics professionals and evaluated CoilCAM’s relevance to manual ceramics by reinterpreting hand-made ceramic vessels. This process revealed the importance of iterative variation and embodied experience in action-oriented workflows.

Deimos: A Grammar of Dynamic Embodied Immersive Visualisation Morphs and Transitions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580754,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13655,"
 We present Deimos, a grammar for specifying dynamic embodied immersive visualisation morphs and transitions. A morph is a collection of animated transitions that are dynamically applied to immersive visualisations at runtime and is conceptually modelled as a state machine. It is comprised of state, transition, and signal specifications. States in a morph are used to generate animation keyframes, with transitions connecting two states together. A transition is controlled by signals, which are composable data streams that can be used to enable embodied interaction techniques. Morphs allow immersive representations of data to transform and change shape through user interaction, facilitating the embodied cognition process. We demonstrate the expressivity of Deimos in an example gallery and evaluate its usability in an expert user study of six immersive analytics researchers. Participants found the grammar to be powerful and expressive, and showed interest in drawing upon Deimos’ concepts and ideas in their own research.

Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581342,0,,"
 This paper explores redirection of activity as an intervention strategy for self-regulation online. We conducted an explorative study (N = 19) of the browser extension Aiki, which redirects a user from a self-defined ‘time-wasting’ website to an online platform for learning programming (Sololearn, Codecademy, or Udemy). Based on quantitative measures alone, using Aiki decreased the participants’ time spent on time-wasting websites on average, and increased programming knowledge. However, several users ended up avoiding their time-wasting websites entirely when Aiki was active, or they discontinued the use of the extension after ‘the novelty wore off’. Based on these effects, we qualitatively explored the user experiences and identified four challenges and four opportunities for using redirection of activity as an intervention strategy for self-regulation of time management in a browser. Our results suggest that this intervention strategy is promising, but careful design is necessary to strike an optimal balance between independence and regulation.

 We propose BirdViewAR, a surroundings-aware remote drone-operation system that provides significant spatial awareness to pilots through an augmented third-person view (TPV) from an autopiloted secondary follower drone. The follower drone responds to the main drone’s motions and directions using our optimization-based autopilot, allowing the pilots to clearly observe the main drone and its imminent destination without extra input. To improve their understanding of the spatial relationships between the main drone and its surroundings, the TPV is visually augmented with AR-overlay graphics, where the main drone’s spatial statuses are highlighted: its heading, altitude, ground position, camera field-of-view (FOV), and proximity areas. We discuss BirdViewAR’s design and implement its proof-of-concept prototype using programmable drones. Finally, we conduct a preliminary outdoor user study and find that BirdViewAR effectively increased spatial awareness and piloting performance.

Point of no Undo: Irreversible Interactions as a Design Strategy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581433,0,,"
 Despite irreversibility being omnipresent in the lifeworld, research on interactions making use of irreversibility in computing systems is still in the early stages. User freedom – provided by the undo functionality – is considered to be a pillar of “usable” computer systems, overcoming irreversibility. Within this paper, we set up a thought experiment, challenging the “undo feature” and instead take advantage of irreversibility in the interaction with physical computing systems (tangibles, robots, etc). First, we present three material speculations, each inherently utilizing irreversibility. Second, we elaborate on the concept of irreversible interactions by contextualizing our work with critical HCI discourses and deducing three design strategies. Finally, we discuss irreversibility as a design element for self-reflection, meaningful acting, and a sustainable relationship with technology. While previously individual aspects of irreversibility have been explored, we contribute a comprehensive discussion of irreversible interactions in HCI presenting artifacts, a conceptualization, design strategies, and application purposes.

Beyond Instructions: A Taxonomy of Information Types in How-to Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581126,0,,"
How-to videos are rich in information—they not only give instructions but also provide justifications or descriptions. People seek different information to meet their needs, and identifying different types of information present in the video can improve access to the desired knowledge. Thus, we present a taxonomy of information types in how-to videos. Through an iterative open coding of 4k sentences in 48 videos, 21 information types under 8 categories emerged. The taxonomy represents diverse information types that instructors provide beyond instructions. We first show how our taxonomy can serve as an analytical framework for video navigation systems. Then, we demonstrate through a user study (n=9) how type-based navigation helps participants locate the information they needed. Finally, we discuss how the taxonomy enables a wide range of video-related tasks, such as video authoring, viewing, and analysis. To allow researchers to build upon our taxonomy, we release a dataset of 120 videos containing 9.9k sentences labeled using the taxonomy.

 Crowdsourcing in China is a thriving industry. Among its most interesting structures, we find crowdfarms, in which crowdworkers self-organize as small organizations to tackle macrotasks. Little, however, is known as to which practices these crowdfarms use to tackle the macrotasks, and this goes hand in hand with the current practice of the HCI research community to treat all forms of complex crowdsourcing work as practically the same. However, macrotasks differ substantially regarding structure and decomposability. Treating them under one umbrella term - macrotasking - can lead to an imprecise understanding of the workforce involved. We address this gap by examining the work practices of 31 Chinese crowdfarms on the four main macrotask types, namely: modular, interlaced, wicked, and container macrotasks. Our results confirm essential differences in how these nascent crowd organizations address different macrotasks and shed light on what platforms can do to improve the uptake of such work.

 This paper introduces semi-automatic data tours to aid the exploration of complex networks. Exploring networks requires significant effort and expertise and can be time-consuming and challenging. Distinct from guidance and recommender systems for visual analytics, we provide a set of goal-oriented tours for network overview, ego-network analysis, community exploration, and other tasks. Based on interviews with five network analysts, we developed a user interface (NetworkNarratives) and 10 example tours. The interface allows analysts to navigate an interactive slideshow featuring facts about the network using visualizations and textual annotations. On each slide, an analyst can freely explore the network and specify nodes, links, or subgraphs as seed elements for follow-up tours. Two studies, comprising eight expert and 14 novice analysts, show that data tours reduce exploration effort, support learning about network exploration, and can aid the dissemination of analysis results. NetworkNarratives is available online, together with detailed illustrations for each tour.

 Polarized light mosaics (PLMs) are color-changing structures that alter their appearance based on the orientation of incident polarized light. While a few artists have developed techniques for crafting PLMs by hand, the underlying material properties are difficult to reason about; there exist no tools to bridge the high-level design objectives with the low-level physics knowledge needed to create PLMs. In this paper, we introduce the first system for creating Polagons: machine-made PLMs crafted from cellophane with user-defined color changing behaviors. Our system includes an interface for designing and visualizing Polagons as well as a fabrication process based on laser cutting and welding that requires minimal assembly by the user. We define the design space for Polagons and demonstrate how formalizing the process for creating PLMs can enable new applications in fields such as education, data visualization, and fashion.

 The HCI research community has long centered ethics in HCI research and practice. This interest has persisted as scholars highlight the need for more situated understandings and deeper integration of ethics into HCI. In parallel, HCI scholars and students have become increasingly involved in teaching computing ethics across many different university contexts, bringing in valuable perspectives informed by the connections between HCI and the socio-technical subject matter of computing ethics. Yet explicitly bringing these two threads together – examining the teaching of ethics through an HCI research lens – remains nascent. This paper integrates work in HCI and computing education to focus on the role and experience of computing ethics teaching assistants (CETAs), who are increasingly involved in ethics instruction and whose perspectives are predominantly missing in existing literature spanning HCI and computing education. Drawing on HCI theories and methods, our qualitative study of eleven CETAs at two American universities makes three contributions to the HCI literature. First, we build an understanding of who these TAs are with respect to the unique position of teaching computing ethics. Second, we characterize how CETAs’ teaching and learning is situated and shaped within different communities and institutional contexts. Finally, we suggest several implications for the design of ethics instruction within undergraduate computing programs. More broadly, our work can be viewed as a call to action, encouraging HCI scholars to play a more significant role in studying and designing the teaching and learning of computing ethics.

We see how different factors influence blind participants’ willingness to share study data as they assess risk-benefit tradeoffs. The majority support sharing of their data to improve technology but also express concerns over commercial use, associated metadata, and the lack of transparency about the impact of their data. These insights have implications for the development of responsible practices for stewarding accessibility datasets, and can contribute to broader discussions in this area.

After the pandemic, it is urgently important to explore the special challenges which arise with hybrid work. Through cross-case analyses of published papers, we propose collocated distance as a design challenge uniquely relevant for hybrid cooperative technologies. We identify and conceptualize collocated distance as a design challenge that arises in hybrid work situations, where at least three actors are mutually dependent in their work while being located within fewer contexts than the number of actors. Collocated distance reminds us that when designing hybrid technologies, we must not only focus on creating technologies that support the work across geographical locations but equally pay attention to the relations and possible disconnections which exist locally between collocated actors. When designing cooperative technologies supporting distributed work, often focus is on the boundaries between geographical contexts – however, in hybrid work, we must not forget to pay attention to the collocated boundaries within the same context.

 This paper analyses Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literature reviews to provide a clear conceptual basis for authors, reviewers, and readers. HCI is multidisciplinary and various types of literature reviews exist, from systematic to critical reviews in the style of essays. Yet, there is insufficient consensus of what to expect of literature reviews in HCI. Thus, a shared understanding of literature reviews and clear terminology is needed to plan, evaluate, and use literature reviews, and to further improve review methodology. We analysed 189 literature reviews published at all SIGCHI conferences and ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI) up until August 2022. We report on the main dimensions of variation: (i) contribution types and topics; and (ii) structure and methodologies applied. We identify gaps and trends to inform future meta work in HCI and provide a starting point on how to move towards a more comprehensive terminology system of literature reviews in HCI.

We finally validate our system in a user study (N = 45) that showed that participants can perceive all four stages of approach via the drone movement and that expressive lights provide a more nuanced user experience. We contribute insights into the design of expressive light systems, as a stepping stone towards machine-initiated communication.

 Laser cutting revolutionizes the creation of personal-fabricated prototypes. These objects can have transformable properties by adopting different materials and be interactive by integrating electronic circuits. However, circuits in laser-cut objects always have limited movements, which refrains laser cutting from achieving interactive prototypes with more complex movable functions like mechanisms. We propose MechCircuit, a design and fabrication pipeline for making mechanical-electronical objects with laser cutting. We leverage the neodymium magnet’s natures of magnetism and conductivity to integrate electronics and mechanical structure joints into prototypes. We conduct the evaluation to explore technological parameters and assess the practical feasibility of the fabrication pipeline. And we organized a user-observing workshop for non-expert users. Through the outcoming prototypes, the result demonstrates the feasibility of MechCircuit as a useful and inspiring prototyping method.

A computer vision system using low-resolution image sensors can provide intelligent services (e.g., activity recognition) but preserve unnecessary visual privacy information from the hardware level. However, preserving visual privacy and enabling accurate machine recognition have adversarial needs on image resolution. Modeling the trade-off of privacy preservation and machine recognition performance can guide future privacy-preserving computer vision systems using low-resolution image sensors. In this paper, using the at-home activity of daily livings (ADLs) as the scenario, we first obtained the most important visual privacy features through a user survey. Then we quantified and analyzed the effects of image resolution on human and machine recognition performance in activity recognition and privacy awareness tasks. We also investigated how modern image super-resolution techniques influence these effects. Based on the results, we proposed a method for modeling the trade-off of privacy preservation and activity recognition on low-resolution images.

We then implemented Squeez’In on an off-the-shelf capacitive sensing smartphone, and employed an SVM-GBDT model for recognizing gestures and user-specific behavioral patterns, achieving 99.3% accuracy and 0.93 F1-score when tested on 21 users. A following 14-day study validated the memorability and long-term stability of Squeez’In.

Relative Design Acquisition: A Computational Approach for Creating Visual Interfaces to Steer User Choices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581028,0,,"
 A central objective in computational design is that an optimal design is desired which optimizes a performance metric. We explore a different problem class with a computational approach we call relative design acquisition. As a motivational example, consider a user prompted to make a choice using buttons. One button may have a more visually appealing design and hence is visually optimal to steer users to click it more often than the second button. In such a design case, a relative design is acquired of a certain quality with respect to a reference design to guide a user decision. After mathematically formalizing this problem, we report the results of three experiments that demonstrate the approach’s efficacy in generating relative designs in a visual interface preference setting. The relative designs are controllable by a quality factor, which affects both comparative ratings and human decision time between the reference and relative designs.

Technological progress has often been measured by the extent to which it shields and protects us from the harshness of nature. At the same time, it has long been recognised that our resulting disengagement from nature negatively affects our wellbeing and impedes awareness of our vital dependence on natural environments. To understand how HCI has considered the possibilities that digital technology offers for engaging with nature, we conducted a scoping review encompassing more than 20 years of HCI research on nature engagement. We compare the orientations, motivations, and methodologies of different threads within this growing body of work. We show how HCI research has enabled varied forms of direct and indirect engagement with nature, and we develop a typology of the roles proposed for technology in this work. We highlight promising and under-utilised approaches to designing for nature engagement and discuss directions for future research.

Big Buddy: A Simulated Embodied Moderating System to Mitigate Children's Reaction to Provocative Situations within Social Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585840,1,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/294013/1/294013.pdf,"
 The use of social Virtual Reality (VR) among children is increasing, but with it comes new forms of harassment that can be difficult for parents to monitor. To address this issue, we have developed ""Big Buddy"", a prototype AI-moderator that aims to safeguard children from potential harassment in social VR. We conducted a study in which 43 children (aged 8-16) participated in a simulated social VR classroom, with fictitious competitors disrupting their game. When Big Buddy intervened, the children reported feeling significantly less negative emotions and felt safer. This is the first study to empirically examine the use of an embodied AI-moderator in social VR from the perspective of children, and it provides important insights for designing AI-moderators in social VR.

Multi-point STM: Effects of Drawing Speed and Number of Focal Points on Users' Responses using Ultrasonic Mid-Air Haptics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580641,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580641,"
Spatiotemporal modulation (STM) is used to render tactile patterns with ultrasound arrays. Previous research only explored the effects of single-point STM parameters, such as drawing speed (Vd). Here we explore the effects of multi-point STM on both perceptual (intensity) and emotional (valence/arousal) responses. This introduces a new control parameter for STM - the number of focal points (Nfp) – on top of conventional STM parameter (Vd). Our results from a study with 30 participants showed a negative effect of Nfp on perceived intensity and arousal, but no significant effects on valence. We also found the effects of Vd still aligned with prior results for single-point, even when different Nfp were used, suggesting that effects observed from single-point also apply to multi-point STM. We finally derive recommendations, such as using single-point STM to produce stimuli with higher intensity and/or arousal, or using multi-point STM for milder and more relaxing (less arousing) experiences.

Sparkling Silence: Practices and Challenges of Livestreaming Among Deaf or Hard of Hearing Streamers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581053,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14682,"
Understanding livestream platforms’ accessibility challenges for minority groups, such as people with disabilities, is critical to increasing the diversity and inclusion of those platforms. While prior work investigated the experiences of streamers with vision or motor loss, little is known about the experiences of deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) streamers who must work with livestreaming platforms that heavily depend on audio. We conducted semi-structured interviews with DHH streamers to learn why they livestream, how they navigate livestream platforms and related challenges. Our findings revealed their desire to break the stereotypes towards the DHH groups via livestream and the intense interplay between interaction methods, such as sign language, texts, lip language, background music, and viewer characteristics. Major accessibility challenges include the lack of real-time captioning, the small sign language reading window, and misinterpretation of sign language. We present design considerations for improving the accessibility of the livestream platforms.

We present a novel intercorporeal experience – an intersubjective haptic voice. Through an autobiographical design inquiry, based on singing techniques from the classical opera tradition, we created Corsetto, a kinesthetic garment for transferring somatic reminiscents of vocal experience from an expert singer to a listener. We then composed haptic gestures enacted in the Corsetto, emulating upper-body movements of the live singer performing a piece by Morton Feldman named Three Voices. The gestures in the Corsetto added a haptics-based ‘fourth voice’ to the immersive opera performance. Finally, we invited audiences who were asked to wear Corsetto during live performances. Afterwards they engaged in micro-phenomenological interviews. The analysis revealed how the Corsetto managed to bridge inner and outer bodily sensations, creating a feeling of a shared intercorporeal experience, dissolving boundaries between listener, singer and performance. We propose that ‘intersubjective haptics’ can be a generative medium not only for singing performances, but other possible intersubjective experiences.

Potential and Challenges of DIY Smart Homes with an ML-intensive Camera Sensor,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581462,0,,"
 Sensors and actuators are crucial components of a do-it-yourself (DIY) smart home system that enables users to construct smart home features successfully. In addition, machine learning (ML) (e.g., ML-intensive camera sensors) can be applied to sensor technology to increase its accuracy. Although camera sensors are often utilized in homes, research on user experiences with DIY smart home systems employing camera sensors is still in its infancy. This research investigates novel user experiences while constructing DIY smart home features using an ML-intensive camera sensor in contrast to commonly used IoT sensors. Thus, we conducted a seven-day field diary study with 12 families who were given a DIY smart home kit. Here, we assess the five characteristics of the camera sensor as well as the potential and challenges of utilizing the camera sensor in the DIY smart home and discuss the opportunities to address existing DIY smart home issues.

Affective Profile Pictures: Exploring the Effects of Changing Facial Expressions in Profile Pictures on Text-Based Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581061,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581061,"
 When receiving text messages from unacquainted colleagues in fully remote workplaces, insufficient mutual understanding and limited social cues can lead people to misinterpret the tone of the message and further influence their impression of remote colleagues. Emojis have been commonly used for supporting expressive communication; however, people seldom use emojis before they become acquainted with each other. Hence, we explored how changing facial expressions in profile pictures could be an alternative channel to communicate socio-emotional cues. By conducting an online controlled experiment with 186 participants, we established that changing facial expressions of profile pictures can influence the impression of the message receivers toward the sender and the message valence when receiving neutral messages. Furthermore, presenting incongruent profile pictures to positive messages negatively affected the interpretation of the message valence, but did not have much effect on negative messages. We discuss the implications of affective profile pictures in supporting text-based communication.

Vergence Matching: Inferring Attention to Objects in 3D Environments for Gaze-Assisted Selection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580685,0,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/188253/1/chi23b_sub5012_cam_i16.pdf,"
Gaze pointing is the de facto standard to infer attention and interact in 3D environments but is limited by motor and sensor limitations. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a vergence-based motion correlation method to detect visual attention toward very small targets. Smooth depth movements relative to the user are induced on 3D objects, which cause slow vergence eye movements when looked upon. Using the principle of motion correlation, the depth movements of the object and vergence eye movements are matched to determine which object the user is focussing on. In two user studies, we demonstrate how the technique can reliably infer gaze attention on very small targets, systematically explore how different stimulus motions affect attention detection, and show how the technique can be extended to multi-target selection. Finally, we provide example applications using the concept and design guidelines for small target and accuracy-independent attention detection in 3D environments.

A Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding User Trust after Voice Assistant Failures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581152,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581152,"
Despite huge gains in performance in natural language understanding via large language models in recent years, voice assistants still often fail to meet user expectations. In this study, we conducted a mixed-methods analysis of how voice assistant failures affect users’ trust in their voice assistants. To illustrate how users have experienced these failures, we contribute a crowdsourced dataset of 199 voice assistant failures, categorized across 12 failure sources. Relying on interview and survey data, we find that certain failures, such as those due to overcapturing users’ input, derail user trust more than others. We additionally examine how failures impact users’ willingness to rely on voice assistants for future tasks. Users often stop using their voice assistants for specific tasks that result in failures for a short period of time before resuming similar usage. We demonstrate the importance of low stakes tasks, such as playing music, towards building trust after failures.

Stuck in the Permissions With You: Developer & End-User Perspectives on App Permissions & Their Privacy Ramifications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581060,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06534,"
 While the literature on permissions from the end-user perspective is rich, there is a lack of empirical research on why developers request permissions, their conceptualization of permissions, and how their perspectives compare with end-users’ perspectives. Our study aims to address these gaps using a mixed-methods approach.  Through interviews with 19 app developers and a survey of 309 Android and iOS end-users, we found that both groups shared similar concerns about unnecessary permissions breaking trust, damaging the app’s reputation, and potentially allowing access to sensitive data. We also found that developer participants sometimes requested multiple permissions due to confusion about the scope of certain permissions or third-party library requirements. Additionally, most end-user participants believed they were responsible for granting a permission request, and it was their choice to do so, a belief shared by many developer participants. Our findings have implications for improving the permission ecosystem for both developers and end-users.

 With face-to-face music collaboration being severely limited during the recent pandemic, mixed reality technologies and their potential to provide musicians a feeling of ""being there"" with their musical partner can offer tremendous opportunities. In order to assess this potential, we conducted a laboratory study in which musicians made music together in real-time while simultaneously seeing their jamming partner’s mixed reality point cloud via a head-mounted display and compared mental effects such as flow, affect, and co-presence to an audio-only baseline. In addition, we tracked the musicians’ physiological signals and evaluated their features during times of self-reported flow. For users jamming in mixed reality, we observed a significant increase in co-presence. Regardless of the condition (mixed reality or audio-only), we observed an increase in positive affect after jamming remotely. Furthermore, we identified heart rate and HF/LF as promising features for classifying the flow state musicians experienced while making music together.

While it is widely assumed that games can engage patients in therapy through their inherent ‘motivational pull’, relatively little attention has been paid to what HCI games research can learn from strategies employed by therapists. We address this gap by leveraging Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and its mini-theories Basic Psychological Needs Theory and Organismic Integration Theory as a theoretical lens on physical therapy for children and adolescents. Results from in-depth interviews with twelve therapists show that they carefully adjust sessions to allow patients to experience competence, making more comprehensive adjustments than currently offered by games. Additionally, we highlight how therapists leverage their relationship with patients to support motivation, but struggle to reconcile meaningful experiences of autonomy with therapeutic goals. On this basis, we reflect on implications for researchers and designers who create games for physical therapy, and the potential of SDT to provide a foundation for game design and therapeutic practice.

 This paper presents a Shape-Adaptive Ternary-Gaussian model for describing endpoint uncertainty when pointing at moving targets of arbitrary shapes. The basic idea of the model is to combine the uncertainty related to the target shape with the uncertainty caused by the target motion. First, we proposed a model to predict endpoint distribution on static targets based on a Dual-Space Decomposition (DUDE) algorithm. Then, we linearly combined a 2D Ternary-Gaussian model with the newly proposed DUDE-based model to make the 2D Ternary-Gaussian model adaptable to moving targets with random shapes. To verify the performance of our model, we compared it with the original 2D Ternary-Gaussian model and a recent proposed Inscribed Circle model in predicting endpoint distribution. The results show that the proposed model outperformed the two baseline models while maintaining good robustness across different shapes and moving speeds.

 Mixed Reality allows for distributed meetings where people’s local physical spaces are virtually aligned into blended interaction spaces. In many cases, people’s physical rooms are dissimilar, making it challenging to design a coherent blended space. We introduce the concept of Partially Blended Realities (PBR) — using Mixed Reality to support remote collaborators in partially aligning their physical spaces. As physical surfaces are central in collaborative work, PBR supports users in transitioning between different configurations of tables and whiteboard surfaces. In this paper, we 1) describe the design space of PBR, 2) present RealityBlender to explore interaction techniques for how users may configure and transition between blended spaces, and 3) provide insights from a study on how users experience transitions in a remote collaboration task. With this work, we demonstrate new potential for using partial solutions to tackle the alignment problem of dissimilar spaces in distributed Mixed Reality meetings.

Observing users in remote settings is unfavorable because it adds filters altering the information that underlie judgement. Still, the COVID pandemic led to an unprecedented popularity of remote user experience tests. In this work, we revisited the question, which information is most important for evaluators to assess users’ emotions successfully and efficiently. In an online study, we asked N=55 participants to assess users’ emotions from short videos of 30 interaction situations. As independent variable, we manipulated the combination of the information channels video of users, video of the interactive technology, and audio within subjects. Our findings indicate that empathic accuracy is highest and mental effort is lowest when all stimuli are present. Surprisingly, empathic accuracy was lowest and mental effort highest, when only video of users was available. We discuss these findings in the light of emotion literature focusing on persons’ facial expressions and derive practical implications for remote observations.

 Finger gesture recognition is gaining great research interest for wearable device interactions such as smartwatches and AR/VR headsets.

We propose a set of natural, inconspicuous and effortless micro finger gestures that can be reliably detected from the complementary signals from both sensors. We design a multi-modal CNN-Transformer model for fast gesture recognition (flick/pinch/tap), and a finger swipe contact detection model to enable fine-grained swipe gesture tracking. We built a prototype which achieves an overall accuracy of 94.83% in detecting fast gestures and enables fine-grained continuous swipe gestures tracking. AO-Finger is practical for use as a wearable device and ready to be integrated into existing wrist-worn devices such as smartwatches.

Collaboration with Conversational AI Assistants for UX Evaluation: Questions and How to Ask them (Voice vs. Text),https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581247,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03638,"
 AI is promising in assisting UX evaluators with analyzing usability tests, but its judgments are typically presented as non-interactive visualizations. Evaluators may have questions about test recordings, but have no way of asking them. Interactive conversational assistants provide a Q&A dynamic that may improve analysis efficiency and evaluator autonomy. To understand the full range of analysis-related questions, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz design probe study with 20 participants who interacted with simulated AI assistants via text or voice. We found that participants asked for five categories of information: user actions, user mental model, help from the AI assistant, product and task information, and user demographics. Those who used the text assistant asked more questions, but the question lengths were similar. The text assistant was perceived as significantly more efficient, but both were rated equally in satisfaction and trust. We also provide design considerations for future conversational AI assistants for UX evaluation.

We have conducted an experiment with 22 participants given the task to recognize digits 0 to 9 drawn on their palms using a mid-air haptic device under two conditions - with and without prior mindfulness meditation. Results show that for frequencies targeting both Meissner (40 Hz) and Pacinian (200 Hz) receptors, meditation significantly improves performance of the participants, as well as increases their confidence. This suggests that including a short meditation step in haptic user interfaces could lead to improved system performance and user satisfaction.

We contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 51 participants exploring our concept in a between-subjects design. For this, we built a prototype of a simple non-humanoid robot that can bend to follow human movements and vary the movement synchronization patterns. We found that synchronized movements lead to significantly higher ratings in an established questionnaire on trust between people and automation but did not influence the willingness to spend money in a trust game.

Being able to assess dog personality can be used to, for example, match shelter dogs with future owners, and personalize dog activities.

To tackle that challenge, we built a device called “Patchkeeper” that can be strapped on the pet’s chest and measures activity through an accelerometer and a gyroscope. In an in-the-wild deployment involving 12 healthy dogs, we collected 1300 hours of sensor activity data and dog personality test results from two validated questionnaires. By matching these two datasets, we trained ten machine learning classifiers that predicted dog personality from activity data, achieving AUCs in [0.63-0.90], suggesting the value of tracking psychological signals of pets using wearable technologies.

 Visualization grammars, often based on the Grammar of Graphics (GoG), have much potential for augmenting data analysis in a programming environment. However, we do not know how analysts conceptualize grammar abstractions, or how a visualization grammar works with data analysis in practice. Therefore, we qualitatively analyzed how experienced analysts (N = 6) from TidyTuesday, a social data project, wrangled and visualized data using GoG-based ggplot2 without given tasks in R Markdown. Though participants’ analysis and customization needs could mismatch with GoG component design, their analysis processes aligned with the goal of GoG to expedite visualization iteration. We also found a feedback loop and tight coupling between visualization and data transformation code, explaining both participants’ productivity and their errors. From these results, we discuss how future visualization grammars can become more practical for analysts and how visualization grammar and analysis tools can better integrate within a programming (i.e., computational notebook) environment.

Soft (compliant) curvature-changing UIs provide haptic feedback through changes in softness and curvature. Different softness can impact the deformation of UIs when worn and touched, and thus impact the users’ perception of the curvature. To investigate how softness impacts users’ perception of curvature, we measured participants’ curvature perception accuracy and precision in different softness conditions. We found that participants perceived the curviest surfaces with similar precision in all different softness conditions. Participants lost half the precision of the rigid material when touching the flattest surfaces with the softest material. Participants perceived all curvatures with similar accuracy in all softness conditions. The results of our experiment lay the foundation for soft curvature perception and provide guidelines for the future design of curvature- and softness-changing UIs.

To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with nine older adults, aged between 61 and 69 years old, to understand their perceptions regarding several smart ring models representative of rings, ring-like, and ring-ready finger-augmentation devices. We also elicited our participants’ preferences for using smart rings in their everyday life, such as for controlling various home appliances and electronic devices. Our results show an overall positive experience and openness toward adopting smart rings, which were perceived useful to assist with various activities. Based on our findings and following the aging research agenda in HCI, we propose future work opportunities for designing smart ring technology tailored to the needs and preferences of older adults.

Imagine That! Imaginative Suggestibility Affects Presence in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581212,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581212,"
 Personality characteristics can affect how much presence an individual experiences in virtual reality, and researchers have explored how it may be possible to prime users to increase their sense of presence. A personality characteristic that has yet to be explored in the VR literature is imaginative suggestibility, the ability of an individual to successfully experience an imaginary scenario as if it were real. In this paper, we explore how suggestibility and priming affect presence when consulting an ancient oracle in VR as part of an educational experience – a common VR application. We show for the first time how imaginative suggestibility is a major factor which affects presence and emotions experienced in VR, while priming cues have no effect on participants’ (n=128) user experience, contrasting results from prior work. We consider the impacts of these findings for VR design and provide guidelines based on our results.

Characterizing the Technology Needs of Vulnerable Populations for Participation in Research and Design by Adopting Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581221,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581221,"
 While various frameworks and heuristics exist within the HCI community to guide research and design for vulnerable populations, most are centered on the researcher’s involvement. In this work, we developed a conceptual framework for supporting the participation of vulnerable populations in the research and design of technologies. Building upon Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, we synthesized 84 research articles that focus on vulnerable populations and technology to develop our framework. This framework conceptualizes both the barriers, such as lack of technology access and digital literacy, and assets, like social relationships, that impact effective participation in research and design. Using our framework can guide researchers in identifying and fulfilling the technology-related needs of vulnerable populations, leading to more empowering research participation for these groups. The framework’s guiding questions offer researchers the opportunity to reflect on their approach prior to and during their collaboration with vulnerable populations in technology research and design.

Social Virtual Reality as a Mental Health Tool: How People Use VRChat to Support Social Connectedness and Wellbeing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581103,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581103,"
Social virtual reality (VR) platforms have increased in popularity with many people turning to these platforms to experience social connection, including a rapid influx of users during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is limited understanding of how people appropriate and use emerging social VR applications to actively support their mental health and wellbeing in daily life. Through an online questionnaire and exploratory interviews conducted within the social VR app VRChat during the COVID-19 pandemic, we document how social VR is being used explicitly as a mental health support tool. Participants reported positive wellbeing benefits, mostly attributed to the anonymity provided by avatars and perceived safety within digital worlds and communities of practice. We also report how people use social VR to practice social interaction, reduce negative thoughts and form strong social bonds and connections with others.

A Review and Collation of Graphical Perception Knowledge for Visualization Recommendation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581349,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581349,"
Selecting appropriate visual encodings is critical to designing effective visualization recommendation systems, yet few findings from graphical perception are typically applied within these systems. We observe two significant limitations in translating graphical perception knowledge into actionable visualization recommendation rules/constraints: inconsistent reporting of findings and a lack of shared data across studies. How can we translate the graphical perception literature into a knowledge base for visualization recommendation? We present a review of 59 papers that study user perception and performance across ten visual analysis tasks. Through this study, we contribute a JSON dataset that collates existing theoretical and experimental knowledge and summarizes key study outcomes in graphical perception. We illustrate how this dataset can inform automated encoding decisions with three representative visualization recommendation systems. Based on our findings, we highlight open challenges and opportunities for the community in collating graphical perception knowledge for a range of visualization recommendation scenarios.

 To support efficient, balanced news consumption, merging articles from diverse sources into one, potentially through crowdsourcing, could alleviate some hurdles. However, the merging process could also impact annotators’ attitudes towards the content. To test this theory, we propose comparative news annotation; that is, annotating similarities and differences between a pair of articles. By developing and deploying NewsComp—a prototype system—we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 109) to examine how users’ annotations compare to experts’, and how comparative annotation affects users’ perceptions of article credibility and quality. We found that comparative annotation can marginally impact users’ credibility perceptions in certain cases; it did not impact perceptions of quality. While users’ annotations were not on par with experts’, they showed greater precision in finding similarities than in identifying disparate important statements. The comparison process also led users to notice differences in information placement and depth, degree of factuality/opinion, and empathetic/inflammatory language use. We discuss implications for the design of future comparative annotation tasks.

Upvotes? Downvotes? No Votes? Understanding the relationship between reaction mechanisms and political discourse on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580644,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09540,"
 A significant share of political discourse occurs online on social media platforms. Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes, downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users’ style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First, despite being “ideal constructs of political rhetoric,” we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship between social media interface design and respectful political discussion among users.1

 Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely deployed in smartphone photography; and prompt-based image synthesis models have rapidly become commonplace. In this paper, we describe a Research-through-Design (RtD) project which explores this shift in the means and modes of image production via the creation and use of the Entoptic Field Camera. Entoptic phenomena usually refer to perceptions of floaters or bright blue dots stemming from the physiological interplay of the eye and brain. We use the term entoptic as a metaphor to investigate how the material interplay of data and models in AI technologies shapes human experiences of reality. Through our case study using first-person design and a field study, we offer implications for critical, reflective, more-than-human and ludic design to engage AI technologies; the conceptualisation of an RtD research space which contributes to AI literacy discourses; and outline a research trajectory concerning materiality and design affordances of AI technologies.

To explore the state of SSHD use by PwD, we collected 114,871 amazon.com reviews for popular SSHDs and created a data set of reviews pertaining to PwD. We performed a broad analysis of the reviews in this data set and found that the presence of SSHDs empowered PwD to secure their domiciles independently. Further, caregivers used SSHDs to monitor PwD, ostensibly for the latter’s safety, albeit without explicit consent. Moreover, we also found that SSHDs have several drawbacks that impose various barriers of use on PwD. We analyze the significance of these findings and suggest five future research opportunities for SSHD design.

Using Research through Design, we develop and deploy Kaleidoscope, an online tool for documenting design process, in an upper-level HCI class during the COVID-19 pandemic, iteratively developing it in response to student feedback and needs. We discuss key themes from the real-world deployment of Kaleidoscope, including: tensions between documentation and creation; effects of centralizing discussion; privacy and visibility in shared spaces; balancing evidence of achievement with feelings of overwhelm; and the effects of initial perceptions and incentives on tool usage. These successes and challenges provide insights to guide future tools for design documentation and HCI education that scaffold learning process as an equal partner to execution.

When designing an AI-assisted decision-making system, there is often a tradeoff between precision and recall in the AI’s recommendations. We argue that careful exploitation of this tradeoff can harness the complementary strengths in the human-AI collaboration to significantly improve team performance. We investigate a real-world video anonymization task for which recall is paramount and more costly to improve. We analyze the performance of 78 professional annotators working with a) no AI assistance, b) a high-precision ""restrained"" AI, and c) a high-recall ""zealous"" AI in over 3,466 person-hours of annotation work. In comparison, the zealous AI helps human teammates achieve significantly shorter task completion time and higher recall. In a follow-up study, we remove AI assistance for everyone and find negative training effects on annotators trained with the restrained AI. These findings and our analysis point to important implications for the design of AI assistance in recall-demanding scenarios.

Evaluating the Extension of Wall Displays with AR for Collaborative Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580752,0,https://hal.science/hal-04010673/document,"
 Wall displays are well suited for collaborative work and are often placed in rooms with ample space in front of them that remains largely unused. Augmented Reality (AR) headsets can seamlessly extend the collaboration space around the Wall. Nevertheless, it is unclear if extending Walls with AR is effective and how it may affect collaboration. We first present a prototype combining a Wall and AR headsets to extend the Wall workspace. We then use this prototype to study how users utilize the virtual space created in AR. In an experiment with 24 participants, we compare how pairs solve collaborative tasks with the Wall alone and with Wall+AR. Our qualitative and quantitative results highlight that with Wall+AR, participants use the physical space in front and around the Wall extensively, and while this creates interaction overhead, it does not impact performance and improves the user experience.

Live and pre-recorded video tutorials are an effective means for teaching physical skills such as cooking or prototyping electronics. A dedicated cameraperson following an instructor’s activities can improve production quality. However, instructors who do not have access to a cameraperson’s help often have to work within the constraints of static cameras. We present Stargazer, a novel approach for assisting with tutorial content creation with a camera robot that autonomously tracks regions of interest based on instructor actions to capture dynamic shots. Instructors can adjust the camera behaviors of Stargazer with subtle cues, including gestures and speech, allowing them to fluidly integrate camera control commands into instructional activities. Our user study with six instructors, each teaching a distinct skill, showed that participants could create dynamic tutorial videos with a diverse range of subjects, camera framing, and camera angle combinations using Stargazer.

Gaming for Post-Work Recovery: The Role of Immersion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581510,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581510,"
Playing digital games can be an effective means of recovering from daily work strain. However, limited research has examined which player experiences contribute to this process, limiting the ability of players to select games and play them in a manner which helps them recover effectively. Hence, this paper reports a mixed-methods survey study investigating how a recent post-work recovery episode was impacted by immersion: a player experience which has been implicated in theoretical accounts relating games and recovery. We found that particular dimensions of immersion, such as cognitive involvement, support specific post-work recovery needs. Moreover, participants report not only experiencing benefits in a passive manner, but actively optimising their levels of immersion to achieve recovery. This study extends previous research by improving our understanding of how digital games support post-work recovery and by demonstrating that immersion is key in determining the restorative potential of digital games.

Visual content must be labeled to facilitate navigation and retrieval, or provide ground truth data for supervised machine learning approaches. The efficiency of labeling techniques is crucial to produce numerous qualitative labels, but existing techniques remain sparsely evaluated. We systematically evaluate the efficiency of tagging and browsing tasks in relation to the number of images displayed, interaction modes, and the image visual complexity. Tagging consists in focusing on a single image to assign multiple labels (image-oriented strategy), and browsing in focusing on a single label to assign to multiple images (label-oriented strategy). In a first experiment, we focus on the nudges inducing participants to adopt one of the strategies (n=18). In a second experiment, we evaluate the efficiency of the strategies (n=24). Results suggest an image-oriented strategy (tagging task) leads to shorter annotation times, especially for complex images, and participants tend to adopt it regardless of the conditions they face.

 Electromyography (EMG) has been explored as an HCI input modality following a long history of success for prosthesis control. While EMG has the potential to address a range of hands-free interaction needs, it has yet to be widely accepted outside of prosthetics due to a perceived lack of robustness and intuitiveness. To understand how EMG input systems can be better designed, we sampled the ACM digital library to identify limitations in the approaches taken. Leveraging these works in combination with our research group’s extensive interdisciplinary experience in this field, four themes emerged (1) interaction design, (2) model design, (3) system evaluation, and (4) reproducibility. Using these themes, we provide a step-by-step framework for designing EMG-based input systems to strengthen the foundation on which EMG-based interactions are built. Additionally, we provide a call-to-action for researchers to unlock the hidden potential of EMG as a widely applicable and highly usable input modality.

Perspective and Geometry Approaches to Mouse Cursor Control in Spatial Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580849,0,,"
Spatial augmented reality (SAR) can extend desktop computing out of the monitor and into our surroundings, but extending the standard style of mouse input is challenging due to real-world geometry irregularity, gaps, and occlusion. We identify two general approaches for controlling a mouse cursor in SAR: perspective-based approaches based on raycasting, such as Nacenta et. al’s Perspective Cursor, and geometry-based approaches that closely associate cursor movement with surface topology. For the latter, we introduce Everywhere Cursor, a geometry-based approach for indirect mouse cursor control for complex 3D surface geometry in SAR. A controlled experiment compares approaches. Results show the geometry-based Everywhere Cursor improves accuracy and precision by 29% to 60% on average in a tracing task, but when traversing long distances, the perspective-based Perspective Cursor and Raycasting techniques are 22% to 49% faster, albeit with 4% to 10% higher error rates.

Videos are convenient resources for asynchronous learning, but they lack interpersonal interactions found in synchronous classrooms. Due to missed social connectedness, the isolated video-based learners experience low emotional, behavioral, and cognitive engagement. This work presents ""Scripted Vicarious Dialogues"" (SVD), a technique for engaging students in a pseudo-social experience of witnessing scripted dialogues between virtual characters (teaching assistants and students) around a video. We conducted a participatory design study to derive design guidelines for SVD. The findings indicate the need to distinguish the virtual components and to give students control of the dialogue’s pace. We then implemented an interactive prototype of SVD and evaluated it (N=40) against a non-social, direct-learning baseline. The results show that the preference for SVD versus the baseline is polarized (25 of 40 preferred SVD; no neutral preferences), and those who preferred SVD had significantly higher emotional and behavioral engagement with SVD compared to the baseline.

In recent years, growing research has been made on supporting children to become more autonomous in the digital environment around them. However, there has been little consensus regarding the conceptualisation of digital autonomy for children in the HCI community and how best they can be supported. Through a systematic review of autonomy-supportive designs within HCI research, this paper makes three contributions: a landscape overview of the existing conceptualisation of Digital Autonomy for children within HCI; a framework of 12 distinct design mechanisms for supporting children’s digital autonomy, clustered into 5 categories by their common mechanisms; and an identification of 5 critical design considerations for future support of children’s digital autonomy. Our findings provide a critical understanding of current support for children’s digital autonomy in HCI. We highlight the importance of considering children’s digital autonomy from multi-perspectives and suggest critical factors and gaps to be considered for future autonomy-supportive designs.

 Deformable interfaces provide unique interaction potential for force input, for example, when users physically push into a soft display surface.

In this paper, we explore how people correspond surface stiffness to colours, graphical shapes, and physical shapes. We conducted a cross-modal correspondence (CC) study, where 30 participants associated different surface stiffnesses with colours and shapes. Our findings evidence the CCs between stiffness levels for a subset of the 2D/3D shapes and colours used in the study. We distil our findings in three design recommendations: (1) lighter colours should be used to indicate soft surfaces, and darker colours should indicate stiff surfaces; (2) rounded shapes should be used to indicate soft surfaces, while less-curved shapes should be used to indicate stiffer surfaces, and; (3) longer 2D drop-shadows should be used to indicate softer surfaces, while shorter drop-shadows should be used to indicate stiffer surfaces.

Misinformation has become a regular occurrence in our lives with many different approaches being sought to address it. One effective way to combat misinformation is for trusted individuals (e.g., family members) to challenge the misinformed person. However, less is known about how these conversations between trusted individuals occur, and how they may impact on relationships. We look to address this gap by conducting semi-structured interviews with family members in the UK who have experienced misinformation within their family networks. We identify several barriers individuals face when challenging misinformed family members, such as the misinformed person’s personality and the extent that pre-conceptions influence beliefs. We also find individuals developing strategies to overcome these barriers, and to cope with difficulties that arise through these conversations. Despite technology being the main driver for misinformation spread, we find it has limitations when used to facilitate or mediate conversations for challenging misinformation between family members.

 Object detection, while being an attractive interaction method for Augmented Reality (AR), is fundamentally error-prone due to the probabilistic nature of the underlying AI models, resulting in sub-optimal user experiences. In this paper, we explore the effect of three game design concepts, Ambiguity, Transparency, and Controllability, to provide better gameplay experiences in AR games that use error-prone object detection-based interaction modalities. First, we developed a base AR pet breeding game, called Bubbleu that uses object detection as a key interaction method. We then implemented three different variants, each according to the three concepts, to investigate the impact of each design concept on the overall user experience. Our user study results show that each design has its own strengths and can improve player experiences in different ways such as decreasing perceived errors (Ambiguity), explaining the system (Transparency), and enabling users to control the rate of uncertainties (Controllability).

When living apart, grandparents and grandchildren often use audio-visual communication approaches to stay connected. However, these approaches seldom provide sufficient companionship and intimacy due to a lack of co-presence and spatial interaction, which can be fulfilled by immersive virtual reality (VR). To understand how grandparents and grandchildren might leverage VR to facilitate their remote communication and better inform future design, we conducted a user-centered participatory design study with twelve pairs of grandparents and grandchildren. Results show that VR affords casual and equal communication by reducing the generational gap, and promotes conversation by offering shared activities as bridges for connection. Participants preferred resemblant appearances on avatars for conveying well-being but created ideal selves for gaining playfulness. Based on the results, we contribute eight design implications that inform future VR-based grandparent-grandchild communications.

From carrying grocery bags to holding onto handles on the bus, there are a variety of situations where one or both hands are busy, hindering the vision of ubiquitous interaction with technology. Voice commands, as a popular hands-free alternative, struggle with ambient noise and privacy issues. As an alternative approach, research explored movements of various body parts (e.g., head, arms) as input modalities, with foot-based techniques proving particularly suitable for hands-free interaction. Whereas previous research only considered the movement of the foot as a whole, in this work, we argue that our toes offer further degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for interaction. To explore the viability of toe-based interaction, we contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 18 participants assessing the impact of five factors on the accuracy, efficiency and user experience of such interfaces. Based on the findings, we provide design recommendations for future toe-based interfaces.

SurfAirs: Surface+ Mid-air Input for Large Vertical Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580877,0,https://hal.science/hal-04009207/file/main.pdf,"
Large vertical surfaces such as wall displays allow users to work with a very large and high-resolution workspace. Such displays promote physical navigation: users can step close to the display to see details, but also move away to get a wider view of the workspace. In terms of input, current solutions usually combine direct touch on the wall with input on a handheld device, disconnecting close and distant input rather than treating it as a continuum. We present SurfAirs, which are physical controllers that users can manipulate on screen (surface input), in the air (mid-air input), and transition from the surface to the air during a single manipulation (hybrid input). We report on two user studies that compare SurfAirs’ performance with bare-hand input for both mid-air and hybrid input. Participants prefer and perform better with SurfAirs.

Save A Tree or 6 kg of CO2? Understanding Effective Carbon Footprint Interventions for Eco-Friendly Vehicular Choices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580675,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580675,"
 From ride-hailing to car rentals, consumers are often presented with eco-friendly options. Beyond highlighting a “green” vehicle and CO2 emissions, CO2 equivalencies have been designed to provide understandable amounts; we ask which equivalencies will lead to eco-friendly decisions. We conducted five ride-hailing scenario surveys where participants picked between regular and eco-friendly options, testing equivalencies, social features, and valence-based interventions. Further, we tested a car-rental embodiment to gauge how an individual (needing a car for several days) might behave versus the immediate ride-hailing context. We find that participants are more likely to choose green rides when presented with additional information about emissions; CO2 by weight was found to be the most effective. Further, we found that information framing—be it individual or collective footprint, positive or negative valence—had an impact on participants’ choices. Finally, we discuss how our findings inform the design of effective interventions for reducing car-based carbon-emissions.

We conducted a three-phase study utilizing mixed-methods to investigate performance on visual and text representations of data between domains. Our findings evidenced how math & computer scientists are proficient utilizing text representations of data while artists benefit more from visual chart representations. Finally, we present perspectives from artists to gain an understanding of their approach to visual and mathematical tasks. Our findings indicate that artists are especially adept at statistical visual tasks and that development of cognitive skills could be fostered by individuals to potentially benefit visualization task performance.

 Ill-structured problems demand that people adopt sophisticated strategies for planning, seeking support, and using available resources along their work process. These practices involve a challenging monitoring and strategizing process that existing tools cannot support since they largely lack an understanding of an organization’s processes, social structures, venues, and tools. We introduce workplace programming for situationally-aware systems–an approach for encoding work situations using computational abstractions of an organization’s ways of working and surfacing support strategies at appropriate times and settings. With this approach, we implement Orchestration Scripts, a system that supports various situated work activities in a socio-technical organization. Through a case study and field study, we show how our approach encodes different aspects of working effectively and helps people identify situations to enact effective strategies using the available support opportunities. Our results show how a programmable technology can provide situated support in today’s workplaces.

 Forensic practitioners analyse intrinsic 3D data daily on 2D screens. We explore novel immersive visualisation techniques that enable digital autopsy through analysis of 3D imagery. We employ a user-centred design process involving four rounds of user feedback: (1) formative interviews eliciting opportunities and requirements for mixed-reality digital autopsies; (2) a larger workshop identifying our prototype’s limitations and further use-cases and interaction ideas; (3+4) two rounds of qualitative user validation of successive prototypes of novel interaction techniques for pathologist sensemaking. Overall, we find MR holds great potential to enable digital autopsy, initially to supplement physical autopsy, but ultimately to replace it. We found that experts were able to use our tool to perform basic virtual autopsy tasks, MR setup promotes exploration and sense making of cause of death, and subject to limitations of current MR technology, the proposed system is a valid option for digital autopsies, according to experts’ feedback.  – Warning: This paper contains sensitive images which are 3D visualisation of deceased people.

Living with Light Touch: An Autoethnography of a Simple Communication Device in Long-Term Use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580807,0,,"
We are a mother and son who have been using a pair of simple, self-build communication devices to maintain a feeling of connection while separated by over 5,000 miles. The devices, called Light Touch, only allow us to send one another slowly-fading, coloured lights, yet we have been surprised by how much our ongoing interaction with them means to us. This paper contributes an autoethnographical account of our experiences over the last two years, including our initial experiences with the devices, and focusing on various aspects of our day-to-day use. Based on our observations, we discuss the features that have proven important in mediating our feelings of connection. We point out, however, that their success is contingent on our context of use and the nature of our bond, and suggest that simple systems like Light Touch may support emotional communication, but only if they are well-matched to settings and relationships.

Challenges and Opportunities for Interactive Technology to Support Parents of HIV-Positive Children in Ethiopia in the Disclosure Process,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580756,0,,"
Fearing stigma, parents often hide their children's HIV diagnosis from them, and postpone disclosure, in turn negatively impacting children's well-being. Our work explores whether interactive technology can support disclosure. In the first study, we examine disclosure experiences and the role of interactive technology from the perspective of HIV-positive children and parents. Through Thematic Analysis, we highlight how disclosure is linked with parents’ own experience of HIV, and that disclosure needs to be viewed as a process. On this basis, we contribute an experience prototype that guides parents through an incremental disclosure process using interactive storytelling. In a second study, we evaluate the prototype through interviews with six parents. Leveraging Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, we show that the prototype has potential to transform how parents understand and approach disclosure. Based on our results, we present further design directions, and discuss the (limitations of the) role that technology can play in this context.

 We propose an algorithm that generates a vibration, an impact, or a vibration+impact haptic effect by processing a sound signal in real time. Our algorithm is selective in that it matches the most appropriate type of haptic effects to the sound using a machine-learning classifier (random forest) that is built on expert-labeled datasets. Our algorithm is tailored to enhance user experiences for video game play, and we present two examples for the RPG (role-playing game) and FPS (first-person shooter) genres. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by a user study in comparison to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for the same cross-modal conversion. Our system elicits better multisensory user experiences than the SOTA algorithms for both game genres.

Effective 2D Stroke-based Gesture Augmentation for RNNs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581358,0,https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~jjl/pubs/Mykola-CHI23.pdf,"
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) require large training datasets from which they learn new class models. This limitation prohibits their use in custom gesture applications where only one or two end user samples are given per gesture class. One common way to enhance sparse datasets is to use data augmentation to synthesize new samples. Although there are numerous known techniques, they are often treated as standalone approaches when in reality they are often complementary. We show that by intelligently chaining augmentation techniques together that simulate different gesture production variability types, such as those affecting the temporal and spatial qualities of a gesture, we can significantly increase RNN accuracy without sacrificing training time. Through experimentation on four public stroke-based 2D gesture datasets, we show that RNNs trained with our data augmentation chaining technique achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy in both writer-dependent and writer-independent test scenarios.

The experience of what we eat depends not only on the taste of the food, but also on other modalities of sensory feedback. Perceptual research has shown the potential of altering visual, olfactory, and textural food cues to affect flavor, texture, and satiety. Recently, the HCI community has leveraged such research to encourage healthy eating, but the resulting tools often require specialised and/or invasive devices. Ubiquitous and unobtrusive, audio feedback-based tools could alleviate those drawbacks, but research in this area has been limited to food texture. We expand on prior psychology research by exploring a wide range of auditory feedback styles to modify not only flavor attributes but also appetite-related measures. We present Auditory Seasoning, a mobile app that offers various curated audio modes to alter chewing sounds. In a Pringles-tasting experiment (N=37), this tool significantly influenced food perception and eating behavior beyond texture alone. Based on these results, we discuss design implications to create custom real-world flavor/satiety-enhancing tools.

 Sharing breathing signals has the capacity to provide insights into hidden experiences and enhance interpersonal communication. However, it remains unclear how the modality of breath signals (visual, haptic) is socially interpreted during collaborative tasks. In this mixed-methods study, we design and evaluate BreatheWithMe, a prototype for real-time sharing and receiving of breathing signals through visual, vibrotactile, or visual-vibrotactile modalities. In a within-subjects study (15 pairs), we investigated the effects of modality on breathing synchrony, social presence, and overall user experience. Key findings showed: (a) there were no significant effects of visualization modality on breathing synchrony, only on deliberate music-driven synchronization; (b) visual modality was preferred over vibrotactile feedback, despite no differences across social presence dimensions; (c) BreatheWithMe was perceived to be an insightful window into others, however included data exposure and social acceptability concerns. We contribute insights into the design of multi-modal real-time breathing visualization systems for colocated, collaborative tasks.

 Peer-support has long been recognized as valuable for mental health, and has been commonly practiced online over the Internet. However, it is often reported that peer exchange online can have harmful effects, and there has been limited research on how to ensure its effectiveness and safety. Our ethnographic study of formalized mental health peer-support practices in Scotland uncovers the infrastructural work involved when setting up and managing conditions upon which peer-support can take place in an effective and safe way. We illustrate that peer-support for mental health is not only about bringing peers together to interact with each other, but also about ensuring availability, timeliness, proactive care, positivity and safety of peer-support as a service, by weaving various social, spatial and technical elements together and managing groups and their boundaries. Our findings illuminate the work behind these peer-support practices, and suggest design implications.

 Trauma-informed design is an important yet challenging area due to required expertise for careful engagement with the vulnerable and traumatized person, particularly with children. While technologies have the potential to generate value for the person with experience of trauma, the risk of exposing them to additional trauma due to research and design has ethical implications. We explore this space by engaging with therapists and social workers as dyads of proxies for parents and children with a history of trauma. We conducted a study as a participatory workshop with proxies to understand how technology could support parents in coaching social-emotional learning during episodes of high intensity emotion and difficult behavior by the child. Our findings identified design qualities to embed in SEL technology, and three roles that parents can play in implementing SEL strategies at home. We contribute a set of seven methodological guidelines for dyadic trauma-informed participatory design with proxies.

Bystanders (i.e., visiting friends, visiting family members, or domestic workers) are often not aware of the data practices in other people’s (i.e., owners’) smart homes, exposing them to privacy risks. One solution to avoid violating bystanders’ privacy is to increase the data practice transparency and facilitate negotiation. In this paper, we designed a negotiation interaction study to explore the behaviors of owners (n1=238 participants assigned with the owner role) and bystanders (n2=222 participants assigned with the bystander role) when negotiating about smart home data practices with the corresponding bystander and owner digital agents. We also asked questions to explore factors that may potentially correlate with or affect the observed negotiation behaviors and outcomes. We found that owner and bystander participants differ in behaviors regarding numbers of rounds of negotiation, final reached preferences, and total number of agreements. We analyzed the correlating factors and predictability of reaching agreements.

 Crowd feedback overcomes scalability issues of feedback collection on interactive website designs. However, collecting feedback on crowdsourcing platforms decouples the feedback provider from the context of use. This creates more effort for crowdworkers to immerse into such context in crowdsourcing tasks. In this paper, we present CrowdSurfer, a browser extension that seamlessly integrates design feedback collection in crowdworkers’ everyday internet surfing. This enables the scalable collection of in situ feedback and, in parallel, allows crowdworkers to flexibly integrate their work into their daily activities. In a field study, we compare the CrowdSurfer against traditional feedback collection. Our qualitative and quantitative results reveal that, while in situ feedback with the CrowdSurfer is not necessarily better, crowdworkers appreciate the effortless, enjoyable, and innovative method to conduct feedback tasks. We contribute with our findings on in situ feedback collection and provide recommendations for the integration of crowdworking tasks in everyday internet surfing.

 Recent studies have explored how users of immersive visualisation systems arrange data representations in the space around them. Generally, these have focused on placement centred at eye-level in absolute room coordinates. However, work in HCI exploring full-body interaction has identified zones relative to the user’s body with different roles. We encapsulate the possibilities for visualisation view management into a design space (called “DataDancing”). From this design space we extrapolate a variety of view management prototypes, each demonstrating a different combination of interaction techniques and space use. The prototypes are enabled by a full-body tracking system including novel devices for torso and foot interaction. We explore four of these prototypes, encompassing standard wall and table-style interaction as well as novel foot interaction, in depth through a qualitative user study. Learning from the results, we improve the interaction techniques and propose two hybrid interfaces that demonstrate interaction possibilities of the design space.

We report the design space with six animation primitives and two modification effects, and we demonstrate the design and fabrication workflow with a customized software platform for design and simulation. A range of applications is shown leveraging the objects’ dynamic displays both visually and thermally, including dynamic artifacts, teaching aids, and ambient displays.

 Phishing attacks are a main threat to organizations and individuals. Current widespread defenses based on spam filters and domain blacklisting are unfortunately insufficient. Prior work identifies phishing reporting as a key, largely untapped resource to mitigate phishing threats. Yet, its practice suffers from very low reporting rates and generally too low an uptake from users. Whereas it is known that phishing reporting behavior is affected by a number of ‘human factors’, a comprehensive view of the different theories and their effects on (intent to) report is not yet developed. To address this gap, we evaluate theories and factors analyzed in the extant literature, build a cohesive theoretical view of their effects and constructs, and develop, model, and empirically evaluate (by means of an online questionnaire, n=284) the resulting hypothesis structure. We discuss both theoretical implications of our findings and research directions for practice at a research and organizational level.

 Head movement is widely used as a uniform type of input for human-computer interaction. However, there are fundamental differences between head movements coupled with gaze in support of our visual system, and head movements performed as gestural expression. Both Head-Gaze and Head Gestures are of utility for interaction but differ in their affordances. To facilitate the treatment of Head-Gaze and Head Gestures as separate types of input, we developed HeadBoost as a novel classifier, achieving high accuracy in classifying gaze-driven versus gestural head movement (F1-Score: 0.89). We demonstrate the utility of the classifier with three applications: gestural input while avoiding unintentional input by Head-Gaze; target selection with Head-Gaze while avoiding Midas Touch by head gestures; and switching of cursor control between Head-Gaze for fast positioning and Head Gesture for refinement. The classification of Head-Gaze and Head Gesture allows for seamless head-based interaction while avoiding false activation.

 Given the high attentional demand in aircraft cockpits, tactons can be used to deliver information without overloading the visual and auditory channels. However, aircraft are subject to turbulence that interfere with vibrotactile feedback. To investigate the impact of turbulence on tacton identification, 18 participants tried to identify 9 tactons with varying intensity and rhythm, while experiencing uncomfortable and very uncomfortable levels of mechanical vibration defined in ISO 2631-1. The results show that the effectiveness of tactile communication decreases with the rhythm identification performance as the level of turbulence increases. In our study, an RMS acceleration delta of 0.70 Grms between two consecutive tactons guaranteed near zero confusion. Based on their experience performing the study, participants built tactons that included 4 pulses, lasted for at least 350 ms and vibrated at no less than 1.25 Grms to be comfortably perceived. Our results will support practitioners for designing tactons that can be more resilient to turbulence.

The paradigm of Privacy by Design aims to integrate privacy early in the product development life cycle. One element of this is to conduct threat modeling with developers to identify privacy threats that engender from the architecture design of the product. In this paper, we propose a systematic lightweight privacy threat modeling framework (MAP) based on attacker personas that is both easy to operationalize and scale. MAP leverages existing privacy threat frameworks to provide an operational roadmap based on relevant threat actors, associated threats, and resulting harm to individuals as well as organizations. We implement MAP as a persona picker tool that threat modelers can use as a menu select to identify, investigate, and remediate relevant threats based on product developer’s scope of privacy risk. We conclude by testing the framework using a repository of 207 privacy breaches extracted from the VERIS Community Database.

Building from a workshop with non-normative sleepers, we reframe sleep tracking to be about understanding and manipulating body rhythms. We explore these rhythms through the RtD process of designing the Awari alertness-forecast and scheduling application in four iterations. This resulted in three non-exclusive categories of rhythmic influence: Slow & Cyclical, Pressure & Release, and Anchored. Through a better understanding of how they interact, their inertia, and their material properties for interaction we encourage the design of technology to shape, and be shaped, by the complex rhythms of life. We discuss ways in which this can democratise medical-models, and make actionable complex bodily processes.

We conducted a scoping review and conceptual analysis with a design lens, identifying 110 papers from the last decade in 11 ACM and IEEE venues that regularly attract AHSD work. Our analysis identified 38 dimensions within 8 facets: demographic, theoretical grounding, impact, system specification, usage specification, ethical consideration, technology, and evaluation. We visualize trends, disciplinary mixing, and topical focus over time, and highlight major advances while pinning down crucial gaps that can be addressed in the future.

Playing with Power Tools: Design Toolkits and the Framing of Equity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581490,0,,"
 Design toolkits that aim to to promote equity offer designers simplified approaches to creating more equitable technology. However, it is important to understand how equity is conceptualized in practice. As a curated collection of methods, toolkits signal how equity is imagined in design. In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis of 17 design toolkits related to equity. We explore alternative design approaches that address inequity in design. We evaluate whether equity toolkits align with calls for changes to design practice, as well as Nancy Fraser’s dimensions of justice. Finally, we find that design toolkits focus on the ‘digital divide’ rather than redistributing world-building power, and thus continue to keep design power with professional designers. We also find that ‘design thinking’ continues to influence design toolkits. Furthermore, the simplicity of toolkits does not engage with the complexities that shape equity in practice. We conclude with suggestions to help researchers and designers rethink design toolkits.

Action Translate: Supporting Students in Translation Volunteering,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581129,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581129,"
University students are well known for volunteering within non-governmental organisations (NGOs). A significant part of NGO practice is the production of documents that communicate their work to local communities and international stakeholders. However, organisations often struggle to resource translations of these documents, resulting in the exclusion of the very same communities that they want to reach. Although many students are multilingual and are willing to volunteer their time and language skills, there are few structured opportunities configured for such non-professional translation of content in the short-term mode that would fit into the student pattern of availability. We developed Action Translate to specifically support these motivated, non-professional translators within the volunteering constraints of university life. Action Translate leverages machine translation post-editing to support teams of volunteers working on NGO translation projects online. Through analysis of a real-world deployment, we discuss how digital systems can be developed to better support student volunteer translators, specifically in building collegiate interaction and identity as translators for a cause.

Supporting Collaborative Discussions In Surgical Teleconsulting Through Augmented Reality Head Mounted Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580714,0,https://hal.science/hal-04017042/file/Maria%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Supporting%20Collaborative%20Discussions%20In%20Surgical%20T.pdf,"
 Although Augmented Reality (AR) has been touted as the future of surgery, its contribution to distributed collaboration such as in surgical teleconsulting has not been articulated. We propose AR-Head Mounted Displays (AR-HMD) to tackle two previously-identified challenges: operating surgeons needing to view and interact with imaging systems that reside away from the operative field, and, their lack of gesturing tools to point and annotate on the shared images and physical environment. We report on a controlled lab experiment where 12 expert gynecology surgeons perform a tumor localisation task guided by a remote radiologist (confederate) via an AR-HMD. We find that bringing the shared images to the place of work reduces the need for clarifications and provides opportunistic access to information when required, and, that pointing and annotating provides opportunities to further support verbal instruction in deictic communication. Our results inform the design of intraoperative AR-HMD systems for surgical telecollaboration.

Soliloquy: Fostering Poetry Comprehension Using an Interactive Think-aloud Visualization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581374,0,,"
 Complex texts like poetry are distinct from informative texts, requiring additional subprocesses to decode and interpret. Approaching a poem without knowledge of these cognitive strategies can result in confusion and frustration—rather than comprehension. In this work, we explore how interfaces can surface and demonstrate these cognitive processes to novice readers. We introduce Soliloquy, an interface that visualizes the thoughts of an expert as they read and interpret a poem by using animations of text and pop-up tooltips. We evaluate the interface in a five-condition Mechanical Turk study (n=254) by varying the detail of thoughts, including audio, and substituting a static text control. Our study detected a significant difference in comprehension between the detail of thoughts, but not between the Soliloquy interface and static text control. We further investigate this finding in a think-aloud study (n=13), revealing the impact individual differences, experience, and cognitive load could have on Soliloquy’s effectiveness.

 Selecting relevant data subsets from large, unfamiliar datasets can be difficult. We address this challenge by modeling and visualizing two kinds of auxiliary information: (1) quality – the validity and appropriateness of data required to perform certain analytical tasks; and (2) usage – the historical utilization characteristics of data across multiple users. Through a design study with 14 data workers, we integrate this information into a visual data preparation and analysis tool, DataPilot. DataPilot presents visual cues about “the good, the bad, and the ugly” aspects of data and provides graphical user interface controls as interaction affordances, guiding users to perform subset selection. Through a study with 36 participants, we investigate how DataPilot helps users navigate a large, unfamiliar tabular dataset, prepare a relevant subset, and build a visualization dashboard. We find that users selected smaller, effective subsets with higher quality and usage, and with greater success and confidence.

While VR, through decades of research, has shown to successfully improve young children's lives, more research needs to examine the appropriateness of VR for children, including its design. The type of character in combination with the perceptual realism of virtual reality (VR) may influence children's perceptions of VR experiences. A within-participant experiment examined 5- to 9-year-old children's (N = 25) perceptions of three different character types in VR (i.e., human, animal, and anthropomorphized creature) based on their level of social realism. Results showed that character type impacted children's (a) social-emotional descriptions of the VR experience, (b) if VR's realism was an asset or a hindrance, and (c) primed thoughts about fantasy versus reality. However, children experienced the embodiment and personification of the characters similarly across all character types. Finally, children recalled the salient aspects of the characters they remembered and identified elements to improve the VR characters’ design.

Societal implications of technology are often considered after public deployment. However, broader impacts ought to be considered during the onset and throughout development to reduce potential for harmful uses, biases, and exclusions. There is a need for tools and frameworks that help technologists become more aware of broader contexts of their work and engage in more responsible and inclusive practices. In this paper, we introduce an online card tool containing questions to scaffold critical reflection about projects’ impacts on society, business, and research. We present the iterative design of the Responsible & Inclusive Cards and findings from five workshops (n=21 participants) with teams distributed across a multinational technology corporation, as well as interviews with people with disabilities to assess gameplay and mental models. We found the tool promoted discussions about challenging topics, reduced power gaps through democratized turn-taking, and enabled participants to identify concrete areas to improve their practice.

 Learning to read Braille is crucial to academic success for people with blindness or severe visual impairment. In our work, we investigate how we can support early learning of Braille with tangible computing. In a human-centered inclusive design process with interviews, six design iterations with prototypes, and feedback from experts, students, and teachers, we created BrailleBuddy. BrailleBuddy is a tangible user interface supporting children with visual impairments in learning Braille. We evaluated BrailleBuddy in a user study with children with blindness. Our results show that BrailleBuddy provides intrinsic motivation for learning Braille and can be used by children without supervision. BrailleBuddy complements the educational program as it allows children to play with and explore Braille characters at their own pace, thus lowering the challenge of learning to read Braille. In addition, an open-source toolkit is provided to enable educators and researchers to support individual requirements.

 Video-sharing platforms (VSPs) such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch attract millions of users and have become influential information sources, especially among the young generation. Video creators and live streamers make videos to engage viewers and form online communities. VSP celebrities obtain monetary benefits through monetization programs and affiliated markets. However, there is a growing concern that user-generated videos are becoming a vehicle for spreading misinformation and controversial content. Creators may make inappropriate content for attention and financial benefits. Some other creators also face harassment and attack. This workshop seeks to bring together a group of HCI scholars to brainstorm technical and design solutions to improve the credibility, trust, and safety of VSPs. We aim to discuss and identify research directions for technology design, policy-making, and platform services for video-sharing platforms.

IntimaSea: Exploring Shared Stress Display in Close Relationships,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581000,1,,"
 Automatic stress tracking has become increasingly available on wearable devices. Research has investigated its use for individual stress management, largely within the traditional data-as-care framing. However, its use for stress sharing in social relationships, particularly close relationships, is still under explored. Inspired by the idea of “caring-through-data”, which focuses on mediating the social and emotional experiences of the collective “us” with data, this paper presents a design study with a prototype called IntimaSea, a display featuring illustrative stress data in collective forms to be shared among close relationships. The field trials with nine groups of intimately-connected users (N=19) highlight its potential on stress awareness, interpretation and management, as well as intimacy promotion. We end by discussing sharing stress for social ways of stress management, stress data as a meaningful social cue mediating relationships, as well as design implications for caring-through-data.

Optical see-through head-mounted displays (OHMDs) can provide just-in-time digital assistance to users while they are engaged in ongoing tasks. However, given users’ limited attentional resources when multitasking, there is a need to concisely and accurately present information in OHMDs. Existing approaches for digital information presentation involve using either text or pictograms. While pictograms have enabled rapid recognition and easier use in warning messages and traffic signs, most studies using pictograms for digital notifications have exhibited unfavorable results. We thus conducted a series of four iterative studies to understand how we can support effective notification presentation on OHMDs during multitasking scenarios. We find that while icon-augmented notifications can outperform text-only notifications, their effectiveness depends on icon familiarity, encoding density, and environmental brightness. We reveal design implications when using icon-augmented notifications in OHMDs and present plausible reasons for the observed disparity in literature.

 Should fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) be designed inclusively and accessibly, independence will be transformed for millions of people experiencing transportation-limiting disabilities worldwide. Although FAVs hold promise to improve efficient transportation without intervention, a truly accessible experience must enable user input, for all people, in many driving scenarios (e.g., to alter a route or pull over during an emergency). Therefore, this paper explores desires for control in FAVs among (n=23) people who are blind and visually impaired. Results indicate strong support for control across a battery of driving tasks, as well as the need for multimodal information. These findings inspired the design and evaluation of a novel multisensory interface leveraging mid-air gestures, audio, and haptics. All participants successfully navigated driving scenarios using our gestural-audio interface, reporting high ease-of-use. Contributions include the first inclusively designed gesture set for FAV control and insight regarding supplemental haptic and audio cues.

 Graphs are common charts used to represent the topological relationship between nodes. It is a powerful tool for data analysis and information retrieval tasks involve asking questions about graphs. In formative study, we found that questions for graphs are not only about the relationship of nodes but also about the properties of graph elements. We propose a pipeline to answer natural language questions about graph visualizations and generate visual answers. We first extract the data from graphs and convert them into GML format. We design data structures to encode graph information and convert them into an knowledge base. We then extract topic entities from questions. We feed questions, entities and knowledge bases into our question-answer model to obtain the SPARQL queries for textual answers. Finally, we design a module to present the answers visually. A user study demonstrates that these visual and textual answers are useful, credible and and transparent.

Initiating conversations with new people at work is often intimidating because of uncertainty about their interests. People worry others may reject their attempts to initiate conversation or that others may not enjoy the conversation. We introduce a new system, Nooks, built on Slack, that reduces fear of social evaluation by enabling individuals to initiate any conversation as a nook—a conversation room that identifies its topic, but not its creator. Automatically convening others interested in the nook, Nooks further reduces fears of social evaluation by guaranteeing individuals in advance that others they are about to interact with are interested in the conversation. In a multi-month deployment with participants in a summer research program, Nooks provided participants with non-threatening and inclusive interaction opportunities, and ambient awareness, leading to new interactions online and offline. Our results demonstrate how intentionally designed social spaces can reduce fears of social evaluation and catalyze new workplace connections.

Generating Haptic Motion Effects for Multiple Articulated Bodies for Improved 4D Experiences: A Camera Space Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580727,0,,"
 Motion effects are indispensable for improving 4D experiences in highly interactive applications, such as amusement parks, 4D theaters, and virtual reality games. Their recent emergence calls for effective algorithms generating motion effects synchronized with audiovisual content. This paper presents an automatic algorithm for synthesizing the object-based motion effects that express the movements of multiple articulated bodies inclusively when the objects’ motion trajectories are available in the 3D camera space. By taking the visual velocities and sizes of all object parts, our method computes a motion proxy that represents the objects’ movements by one point and converts the motion proxy to a motion command through a motion cueing algorithm. The motion proxy is determined by linearly combining the velocities, and its best combination was selected from several candidates by user studies. The results of user studies indicate that our algorithm can produce compelling object-based motion effects that enhance the multisensory experience.

 Persuasive tactics intend to encourage users to open advertising emails. However, these tactics can overwhelm users, which makes them frustrated and leads to lower open rates. This paper intends to understand which persuasive tactics are used and how they are perceived by users. We first developed a categorization of inbox-level persuasive tactics in permission-based advertising emails. We then asked participants to interact with an email inbox prototype, combined with interviews (N=32), to investigate their opinions towards advertising emails and underlying persuasive tactics. Our qualitative findings reveal poor user experience with advertising emails, which was related to feeling surveilled by companies, forced subscription, high prior knowledge about persuasive tactics, and a desire for more agency. We also found that using certain persuasive tactics on the inbox level is perceived as ethically inappropriate. Based on these insights, we provide design recommendations to improve advertising communication and make such emails more valuable to users.

In video meetings, individuals may wish to share various physical objects with remote participants, such as physical documents, design prototypes, and personal belongings. However, our formative study discovered that this poses several challenges, including difficulties in referencing a remote user’s physical objects, the limited visibility of the object, and the friction of properly framing and orienting an object to the camera. To address these challenges, we propose ThingShare, a video-conferencing system designed to facilitate the sharing of physical objects during remote meetings. With ThingShare, users can quickly create digital copies of physical objects in the video feeds, which can then be magnified on a separate panel for focused viewing, overlaid on the user’s video feed for sharing in context, and stored in the object drawer for reviews. Our user study demonstrated that ThingShare made initiating object-centric conversations more efficient and provided a more stable and comprehensive view of shared objects.

Following a pilot experiment and expert survey, we ran a three-month study with 18 pet birds to evaluate the potential value and usability of a parrot-parrot video-calling system. We assessed the system in terms of perception, agency, engagement, and overall perceived benefits. With 147 bird-triggered calls, our results show that 1) every bird used the system, 2) most birds exhibited high motivation and intentionality, and 3) all caretakers reported perceived benefits, some arguably life-transformative, such as learning to forage or even to fly by watching others. We report on individual insights and propose considerations regarding ethics and the potential of parrot video-calling for enrichment.

Love on the Spectrum: Toward Inclusive Online Dating Experience of Autistic Individuals,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581341,0,,"
Online dating is a space where autistic individuals can find romantic partners with reduced social demands. Autistic individuals are often expected to adapt their behaviors to the social norms underlying the online dating platform to appear as desirable romantic partners. However, given that their autistic traits can lead them to different expectations of dating, it is uncertain whether conforming their behaviors to the norm will guide them to the person they truly want. In this paper, we explored the perceptions and expectations of autistic adults in online dating through interviews and workshops. We found that autistic people desired to know whether they behaved according to the platform’s norms. Still, they expected to keep their unique characteristics rather than unconditionally conform to the norm. We conclude by providing suggestions for designing inclusive online dating experiences that could foster self-guided decisions of autistic users and embrace their unique characteristics.

 Humans can play a decisive role in detecting and mitigating cyber attacks if they possess sufficient cybersecurity skills and knowledge. Realizing this potential requires effective cybersecurity training. Cyber range exercises (CRXs) represent a novel form of cybersecurity training in which trainees can experience realistic cyber attacks in authentic environments. Although evaluation is undeniably essential for any learning environment, it has been widely neglected in CRX research. Addressing this issue, we propose a taxonomy-based framework to facilitate a comprehensive and structured evaluation of CRXs. To demonstrate the applicability and potential of the framework, we instantiate it to evaluate Iceberg CRX, a training we recently developed to improve cybersecurity education at our university. For this matter, we conducted a user study with 50 students to identify both strengths and weaknesses of the CRX.

In this paper, we propose a computational model that can simulate blind users’ menu selection performance and strategies, including the way they use techniques like swiping, gliding, and direct touch. We assume that selection behavior emerges as an adaptation to the user’s memory of item positions based on experience and feedback from the screen reader. A key aspect of our model is a model of long-term memory, predicting how a user recalls and forgets item position based on previous menu selections. We compare simulation results predicted by our model against data obtained in an empirical study with ten blind users. The model correctly simulated the effect of the menu length and menu arrangement on selection time, the action composition, and the menu selection strategy of the users.

 Transitional Interfaces are a yet underexplored, emerging class of cross-reality user interfaces that enable users to freely move along the reality-virtuality continuum during collaboration. To analyze and understand how such collaboration unfolds, we propose four analytical lenses derived from an exploratory study of transitional collaboration with 15 dyads. While solving a complex spatial optimization task, participants could freely switch between three contexts, each with different displays (desktop screens, tablet-based augmented reality, head-mounted virtual reality), input techniques (mouse, touch, handheld controllers), and visual representations (monoscopic and allocentric 2D/3D maps, stereoscopic egocentric views). Using the rich qualitative and quantitative data from our study, we evaluated participants’ perceptions of transitional collaboration and identified commonalities and differences between dyads. We then derived four lenses including metrics and visualizations to analyze key aspects of transitional collaboration: (1) place and distance, (2) temporal patterns, (3) group use of contexts, (4) individual use of contexts.

The documentation practice for machine-learned (ML) models often falls short of established practices for traditional software, which impedes model accountability and inadvertently abets inappropriate or misuse of models. Recently, model cards, a proposal for model documentation, have attracted notable attention, but their impact on the actual practice is unclear. In this work, we systematically study the model documentation in the field and investigate how to encourage more responsible and accountable documentation practice. Our analysis of publicly available model cards reveals a substantial gap between the proposal and the practice. We then design a tool named DocML aiming to (1) nudge the data scientists to comply with the model cards proposal during the model development, especially the sections related to ethics, and (2) assess and manage the documentation quality. A lab study reveals the benefit of our tool towards long-term documentation quality and accountability.

Are You Human? Investigating the Perceptions and Evaluations of Virtual Versus Human Instagram Influencers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580943,0,,"
 Virtual influencers (VI) are on the rise on Instagram, and companies increasingly cooperate with them for marketing campaigns. This has motivated an increasing number of studies, which investigate our perceptions of these influencers. Most studies propose that VI are often rated lower in perceived trust and higher in uncanniness. Yet, we still lack a deeper understanding as to why this is the case. We conduct 2 studies: 1) a questionnaire with 150 participants to get the general perception for the included influencers, and 2) an electroencephalography (EEG) study to get insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of influencer perception. Our results support findings from related works regarding lower trust and higher uncanniness associated with VI. Interestingly, the EEG components N400 and LPP did not modulate perceived trust, but rather perceived humanness, uncanniness, and intentions to follow recommendations. This provides a fruitful beginning for future research on virtual humans.

In this paper, I argue that scale is an important quality of research products [32] and reflect upon the lessons learnt from designing and producing research products at scales ranging from one-offs to those reproduced in thousands. I describe details from a body of research completed by our studio over twenty years by examining four research projects that were designed, developed, and manufactured at four distinct levels of scale. I draw out details from these projects that have not previously been reported and discuss the methodological implications of growth not just for design and production, but also for strategies for engaging with participants. In addition, I discuss particular features of research products produced at the four levels of scale and describe the benefits and trade-offs of producing research products at different scales.

What's That Shape? Investigating Eyes-Free Recognition of Textile Icons,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580920,0,,"
 Textile surfaces, such as on sofas, cushions, and clothes, offer promising alternative locations to place controls for digital devices. Textiles are a natural, even abundant part of living spaces, and support unobtrusive input. While there is solid work on technical implementations of textile interfaces, there is little guidance regarding their design—especially their haptic cues, which are essential for eyes-free use. In particular, icons easily communicate information visually in a compact fashion, but it is unclear how to adapt them to the haptics-centric textile interface experience. Therefore, we investigated the recognizability of 84 haptic icons on fabrics. Each combines a shape, height profile (raised, recessed, or flat), and affected area (filled or outline). Our participants clearly preferred raised icons, and identified them with the highest accuracy and at competitive speeds. We also provide insights into icons that look very different, but are hard to distinguish via touch alone.

 Mobile text entry is difficult for people with motor impairments due to limited access to smartphones and the need for precise target selection on touchscreens. Text entry on smartwatches, on the other hand, has not been well explored for the population. Crownboard enables people with limited dexterity enter text on a smartwatch using its crown. It uses an alphabetical layout divided into eight zones around the bezel. The zones are scanned either automatically or manually by rotating the crown, then selected by pressing the crown. Crownboard decodes zone sequences into words and displays word suggestions. We validated its design in multiple studies. First, a comparison between manual and automated scanning revealed that manual scanning is faster and more accurate. Second, a comparison between clockwise and shortest-path scanning identified the former to be faster and more accurate. In the final study with representative users, only 30% participants could use the default Qwerty. They were 9% and 23% faster with manual and automated Crownboard, respectively. All participants were able to use both variants of Crownboard.

Responsible Innovation of Touchless Haptics: A Prospective Design Exploration in Social Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581228,0,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10168794/1/chi23b-sub1828-cam-i16.pdf,"
 The rapid development of touchless systems has introduced many innovations in social interaction scenarios in recent years. People now can interact with touchless systems in social applications that are aimed to be used in everyday situations in the future. This accelerated development makes us ask, what will the next generation of touchless systems be like? How can we responsibly develop new touchless technologies in the future? To answer the first question, we brought together 20 experts to ideate, speculate, and evaluate possible touchless applications for social interactions. A total of 48 ideas were generated from two consecutive workshops. Then, to answer the second question, we critically analyzed those ideas through a thematic analysis using a responsible innovation (RI) framework, and identified key ethical considerations to guide developers, practitioners when designing future touchless systems. We argue that the social scenarios described, and the RI framework proposed in this paper are a useful starting point for responsibly designing the next generation of touchless systems.

DAPIE: Interactive Step-by-Step Explanatory Dialogues to Answer Children's Why and How Questions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581369,0,https://kixlab.github.io/website-files/2023/chi2023-childQA-paper.pdf,"
 Children acquire an understanding of the world by asking “why” and “how” questions. Conversational agents (CAs) like smart speakers or voice assistants can be promising respondents to children’s questions as they are more readily available than parents or teachers. However, CAs’ answers to “why” and “how” questions are not designed for children, as they can be difficult to understand and provide little interactivity to engage the child. In this work, we propose design guidelines for creating interactive dialogues that promote children’s engagement and help them understand explanations. Applying these guidelines, we propose DAPIE, a system that answers children’s questions through interactive dialogue by employing an AI-based pipeline that automatically transforms existing long-form answers from online sources into such dialogues. A user study (N=16) showed that, with DAPIE, children performed better in an immediate understanding assessment while also reporting higher enjoyment than when explanations were presented sentence-by-sentence.

CatAlyst: Domain-Extensible Intervention for Preventing Task Procrastination Using Large Generative Models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581133,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581133,"
CatAlyst uses generative models to help workers’ progress by influencing their task engagement instead of directly contributing to their task outputs. It prompts distracted workers to resume their tasks by generating a continuation of their work and presenting it as an intervention that is more context-aware than conventional (predetermined) feedback. The prompt can function by drawing their interest and lowering the hurdle for resumption even when the generated continuation is insufficient to substitute their work, while recent human-AI collaboration research aiming at work substitution depends on a stable high accuracy. This frees CatAlyst from domain-specific model-tuning and makes it applicable to various tasks. Our studies involving writing and slide-editing tasks demonstrated CatAlyst’s effectiveness in helping workers swiftly resume tasks with a lowered cognitive load. The results suggest a new form of human-AI collaboration where large generative models publicly available but imperfect for each individual domain can contribute to workers’ digital well-being.

Memory Tracer & Memory Compass: Investigating Personal Location Histories as a Design Material for Everyday Reminiscence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581426,0,,"
With the massive adoption of smartphones, location trackers, and GPS-based applications, data is being generated that captures people's geographic locations in more precise detail than ever before. Personal location history archives offer a potentially valuable and overlooked resource for supporting reminiscence and recollection of the past. Yet, little design research has explored how location histories can be used as a material in designing such experiences. To investigate this space, we engaged in a practice-based design research process that resulted in two design artifacts. Memory Tracer is a tangible device that occasionally, yet perpetually surfaces locations from the past bound to today's date. Memory Compass is a smartwatch application that uses a ‘casting’ interaction enabling a user to retrieve and explore locations from their past, across space and time. We unpack and reflect on key decisions in our design process and conclude with opportunities for future HCI research and practice.

Graphical Perception of Saliency-based Model Explanations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581320,0,,"
 In recent years, considerable work has been devoted to explaining predictive, deep learning-based models, and in turn how to evaluate explanations. An important class of evaluation methods are ones that are human-centered, which typically require the communication of explanations through visualizations. And while visualization plays a critical role in perceiving and understanding model explanations, how visualization design impacts human perception of explanations remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the graphical perception of model explanations, specifically, saliency-based explanations for visual recognition models. We propose an experimental design to investigate how human perception is influenced by visualization design, wherein we study the task of alignment assessment, or whether a saliency map aligns with an object in an image. Our findings show that factors related to visualization design decisions, the type of alignment, and qualities of the saliency map all play important roles in how humans perceive saliency-based visual explanations.

Designing Virtual Environments for Social Engagement in Older Adults: A Qualitative Multi-site Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581262,0,,"
 Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as a platform for social interaction, including as a means for elders to maintain engagement. However, not many empirical studies have been conducted to examine features of social VR that are most relevant to elders’ experiences. The current study qualitatively analyzed the behavior of older adults in a collaborative VR environment and evaluated aspects of design that affected their engagement outcomes. We paired 36 participants over the age of 60 from three diverse geographic locations to interact in collaborative VR modules. Video-based observation methods and thematic analyses were used to study their interactions. The results indicated a strong link between conversations about personal lives in VR and social engagement, highlighting the need for social VR to encourage users to create their own stories and share their life experiences. The study provides new insights into design guidelines that could improve social VR for older adults.

When users reach their arms to different locations in physical space, they often adapt how they move (i.e., kinematic properties of their reaches) depending on the: (1) direction they move, (2) hand they use, and (3) side of the body where the movement occurs. However, it is not yet clear if and how these three properties of reaching tasks may interact to influence users’ behavior when they reach to objects in VR. To address this question, we had users perform virtual hand reaches in five different directions, on both sides of their bodies, using both their dominant and non-dominant hands. The results revealed that users adapted their virtual hand reaching movements in response to changes in all three properties. The findings provide practitioners insights on how to measure and interpret users’ movements, which has applicability in emerging contexts that include detecting VR usability issues and using VR for stroke rehabilitation.

Whilst the use of smart home systems has shown promise in recent years supporting older people's activities at home, there is more evidence needed to understand how these systems impact the type and the amount of shared care in the home. It is important to understand care recipients and caregivers' labour is changed with the introduction of a smart home system to efficiently and effectively support an increasingly aging population with technology. Five older households (8 participants) were interviewed before, immediately after and three months after receiving a Smart Home Health System (SHHS). We provide an identification and documentation of critical incidents and barriers that increased inter-household care work and prevented the SHHS from being successfully accepted within homes. Findings are framed within the growing body of work on smart homes for health and care, and we provide implications for designing future systems for shared home care needs.

Constraints and Workarounds to Support Clinical Consultations in Synchronous Text-based Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581014,0,,"
Medical consultations over synchronous text-based platforms are becoming increasingly popular for virtual care, yet little is known about how physicians translate their training to this healthcare medium. We report the constraints, workarounds, and opportunities highlighted by eight primary care physicians who used such a platform in simulated medical scenarios with standardized patients. We found that due to the perceived inefficiency of communicating over text, the physicians made subconscious use of double-barreled questions and action multiplexing to streamline the conversation. In addition, the physicians overcame the lack of missing verbal and visual cues by adding explicit messages to convey empathy and active listening. We also identify several affordances of text-based platforms, such as the ability for users to reference the conversation history and for patients to feel a sense of privacy during sensitive disclosure. From these findings, we propose design opportunities for how future synchronous text-based platforms can better support medical consultations.

 Blind and low vision (BLV) users often rely on alt text to understand what a digital image is showing. However, recent research has investigated how touch-based image exploration on touchscreens can supplement alt text. Touchscreen-based image exploration systems allow BLV users to deeply understand images while granting a strong sense of agency. Yet, prior work has found that these systems require a lot of effort to use, and little work has been done to explore these systems’ bottlenecks on a deeper level and propose solutions to these issues. To address this, we present ImageAssist, a set of three tools that assist BLV users through the process of exploring images by touch — scaffolding the exploration process. We perform a series of studies with BLV users to design and evaluate ImageAssist, and our findings reveal several implications for image exploration tools for BLV users.

Being a little more careful about the sound that people produce is difficult in shared houses because individuals can generate several unintended living noises and sounds. We designed Tunee to help each housemate better understand the others’ context and desired noise-level. It is an interactive speaker that allows people to share noise-level preferences through the position change of nodes. Our three-week in-field study with four groups of participants revealed that expressing noise-level preference through nodes reduced the burden of verbally delivering issues about the trivial noises of everyday life, and the intentions of the lowered preference were referred to and deemed significant. We also identified how participants figured out what behavior was acceptable for others according to each noise-level. Our findings imply considerations in designing interfaces to support coordinating behaviors and awareness of social contexts in shared spaces.

 Video-sharing platforms (VSPs) such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch have grown rapidly in recent years and attracted millions of users. Research topics such as online communities, video interactions, and recommendation algorithms have drawn increasing attention. Group and community dynamics were also examined with live streaming and short-form videos. However, HCI literature lacks a holistic picture of video-sharing research themes, methods, and findings that summarizes the diverse topics on interaction modalities and communities. Prior reviews on VSPs were about a particular platform or reviewed as a part of social media. This paper contributes a scoping review of 106 articles on video-sharing published in HCI literature from 2012 to June 2022. We identified six research themes through grounded theory analysis and encoded five HCI research methods in VSP studies. We concluded a framework with five components to structure findings in video-sharing research, with which we reflect on future directions on this topic.

We present a visuo-haptic crossmodal model of shape perception designed for shape-changing handheld controllers. The model uses the inertia tensor of an object to bridge the two senses. The model was constructed from the results of three perceptual experiments. In the first two experiments, we validate that the primary moment and product of inertia (MOI and POI) in the inertia tensor have critical effects on the haptic perception of object length and asymmetry. Then, we estimate a haptic-to-visual shape matching model using MOI and POI as two link variables from the results of the third experiment for crossmodal magnitude production. Finally, we validate in a summative user study that the inverse of the shape matching model is effective for pairing a perceptually-congruent haptic object from a virtual object—the functionality we need for shape-changing handheld interfaces to afford perceptually-fulfilling sensory experiences in virtual reality.

 Mutual awareness of visual attention is crucial for successful collaboration. Previous research has explored various ways to represent visual attention, such as field-of-view visualizations and cursor visualizations based on eye-tracking, but these methods have limitations. Verbal communication is often utilized as a complementary strategy to overcome such disadvantages. This paper proposes a novel method that combines verbal communication with the Cone of Vision to improve gaze inference and mutual awareness in VR. We conducted a within-group study with pairs of participants who performed a collaborative analysis of data visualizations in VR. We found that our proposed method provides a better approximation of eye gaze than the approximation provided by head direction. Furthermore, we release the first collaborative head, eyes, and verbal behaviour dataset. The results of this study provide a foundation for investigating the potential of verbal communication as a tool for enhancing visual cues for joint attention.

 Social media platforms use short, highly engaging videos to catch users’ attention. While the short-form video feeds popularized by TikTok are rapidly spreading to other platforms, we do not yet understand their impact on cognitive functions. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 60) investigating the impact of engaging with TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube while performing a Prospective Memory task (i.e., executing a previously planned action). The study required participants to remember intentions over interruptions. We found that the TikTok condition significantly degraded the users’ performance in this task. As none of the other conditions (Twitter, YouTube, no activity) had a similar effect, our results indicate that the combination of short videos and rapid context-switching impairs intention recall and execution. We contribute a quantified understanding of the effect of social media feed format on Prospective Memory and outline consequences for media technology designers to not harm the users’ memory and wellbeing.

 High-tech augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices can offer vital communication support for those with complex communication needs (CCNs). Unfortunately, these devices are rarely adopted. Abandonment has been linked to many factors – commonly, stigma resulting from the visibility of the device and its intrusion into other essential modes of communication like body language. However, visible AAC is strategically useful for setting conversational expectations. In this work, we explore how we might envision AAC to address these tensions directly. We conduct user-centred design activities to build three high-fidelity AAC prototypes with different communities with CCNs, specialists and stakeholders. The prototypes demonstrate different form factors, visibility and modes of input/output. Subsequently, we conduct two qualitative focus groups using convergent and divergent co-design methods with people with the language impairment aphasia – supporting ideation of seven discreet and wearable low-fidelity AAC prototypes and critique of the three high-fidelity prototypes.

With the expanding popularity of Location-Based Games and the rise of advertising therein, there exists a need to comprehend the impact of Location-Based Game Advertising (LGA). This paper seeks to identify what makes positively affective LGA, leveraging Pokémon GO as a probe. Researchers conducted twenty-seven (n=27) semi-structured interviews with Pokémon GO players to reveal lived experiences regarding LGA. Our findings highlight the following direct implications for LGA: (1) LGA act as a digital billboard, conveying qualitative alongside locative information, and (2) well-received LGA enhances the player’s agency. We additionally identify findings that have auxiliary implications to LGA: (3) positive memorability occurs when points of interest match physical reality, and (4) ludic engagement is a mediating factor in the memorability of locations. This research demonstrates that LGA in Location-Based Games is surprisingly well-received. However, developers must provide extra consideration to the player’s agency for such techniques to be effective.

Digital technologies can conduct an important role in preserving intangible cultural heritage (ICH). Nonetheless, existing work tends to be limited to digital storage, presentation, dissemination, and education, with comparatively little concentrating on production and reproduction of the craft, the key to revitalizing ICH.

Taking Hairy Monkey craftsmanship as an instance, we conducted a workshop with 15 groups of makers, teaching them the traditional Hairy Monkey craft and subsequently enabling them to create innovative works with digital technologies in their own time. As revealed by our interviews with these participants, ICH brings cultural inspiration to digital making, and digital making rejuvenates ICH through innovative art forms and its positive influence on participants. As demonstrated in this paper, digital technologies can be deeply integrated with ICH through making to revitalize ICH from the core through living transmission.

Our participants describe a temporal mismatch, whereby digital literacy requires time-consuming processes that cannot be accelerated, but institutional and societal pressures demand speed. We also describe strategies that participants envisaged to cope with this mismatch. This leads us to discuss how the HCI community can better engage with the temporal aspects of digital literacy work, with a view toward expanding the range of solutions we can design to address the misinformation crisis.

Through interviews and focus group discussions with 36 participants, we identified that people’s daily schedules and affective states were dominant factors that shape their messaging preferences. We developed two messaging dialogues centered around these factors, which we deployed to 42 participants to test and extend our initial understanding of users’ needs. Across both studies, participants provided diverse opinions of how they could be best supported by messages, particularly around when to engage users in more passive versus active ways. They also proposed ways of adjusting message length and content during periods of low mood.

In this paper, we aim to establish acceptance, needs, and concerns regarding a preemptive assessment and intervention system to support longitudinal BD management. We interviewed 10 individuals living with BD. To ground the findings in lived experiences, we used a hypothetical assessment and intervention system focusing on online behaviors. Based on the data, we have identified requirements for effective behavioral monitoring across illness episodes. We have also established design recommendations to support dynamic, longitudinal interventions that can address the evolving user needs for life-long BD management.

We present Surch, a system that enables structural search and comparison of surgical procedures. Surch supports video search based on procedural graphs generated by our clustering workflow capturing latent patterns within surgical procedures. We used vectorization and weighting schemes that characterize the features of procedures, such as recursive structures and unique paths. Surch enhances cross-video comparison by providing video navigation synchronized by surgical steps. Evaluation of the workflow demonstrates the effectiveness and interpretability (Silhouette score = 0.82) of our clustering for surgical learning. A user study with 11 residents shows that our system significantly improves the learning experience and task efficiency of video search and comparison, especially benefiting junior residents.

Results from user studies show that the system is effective and efficient at recognizing five or ten facial expressions with an accuracy of around , using a personalized classifier trained with only six data points per expression. The system’s performance is stable across the use sessions and further improves when more data points are collected. We further developed two LiveEmoji applications for facilitating online and face-to-face communication of facemask wearers, demonstrated them in user interviews, and obtained positive participant feedback. Based on the results and findings of the study, we discuss implications and future research directions for facilitating emotional communication between facemask wearers and others.

CoArgue: Fostering Lurkers' Contribution to Collective Arguments in Community-based QA Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580932,0,,"
In Community-Based Question Answering (CQA) platforms, people can participate in discussions about non-factoid topics by marking their stances, providing premises, or arguing for the opinions they support, which forms “collective arguments”. The sustainable development of collective arguments relies on a big contributor base, yet most of the frequent CQA users are lurkers who seldom speak out. With a formative study, we identified detailed obstacles preventing lurkers from contributing to collective arguments. We consequently designed a processing pipeline for extracting and summarizing augmentative elements from question threads. Based on this we built CoArgue, a tool with navigation and chatbot features to support CQA lurkers’ motivation and ability in making contributions.

Co-designing Community-based Sharing of Smarthome Devices for the Purpose of Co-monitoring In-home Emergencies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581239,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06652,"
 We conducted 26 co-design interviews with 50 smarthome device owners to understand the perceived benefits, drawbacks, and design considerations for developing a smarthome system that facilitates co-monitoring with emergency contacts who live outside of one’s home. Participants felt that such a system would help ensure their personal safety, safeguard from material loss, and give them peace of mind by ensuring quick response and verifying potential threats. However, they also expressed concerns regarding privacy, overburdening others, and other potential threats, such as unauthorized access and security breaches. To alleviate these concerns, participants designed flexible and granular access control and fail-safe back-up features. Our study reveals why peer-based co-monitoring of smarthomes for emergencies may be beneficial but also difficult to implement. Based on the insights gained from our study, we provide recommendations for designing technologies that facilitate such co-monitoring while mitigating its risks.

 Large crowds in public transit stations and vehicles introduce obstacles for wayfinding, hygiene, and physical distancing. Public displays that currently provide on-site transit information could also provide critical crowdedness information. Therefore, we examined people’s crowd perceptions and information preferences before and during the pandemic, and designs for visualizing crowdedness to passengers. We first report survey results with public transit users (n = 303), including the usability results of three crowdedness visualization concepts. Then, we present two animated crowd simulations on public displays that we evaluated in a field study (n = 44). We found that passengers react very positively to crowding information, especially before boarding a vehicle. Visualizing the exact physical spaces occupied on transit vehicles was most useful for avoiding crowded areas. However, visualizing the overall fullness of vehicles was the easiest to understand. We discuss design implications for communicating crowding information to support decision-making and promote a sense of safety.

Independence for Whom? A Critical Discourse Analysis of Onboarding a Home Health Monitoring System for Older Adult Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580733,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580733,"
 Home health monitoring systems (HHMS) are presented as a cost-effective solution that will assist with collaborative care of older adults. However, instead of care recipients feeling like collaborators, such systems often disempower them. In this paper, we examine the dissemination, onboarding, and initial use of an HHMS to see how the discourse used by developers and participants affects users’ collaborative care efforts. We found that the textual information provided often contrasted with how our participants managed their care. Instead of providing participants with ‘independence,’ ‘safety,’ and ‘peace of mind,’ care recipients were placed in a more dependent, less proactive role, and care providers were pressured to take on more responsibilities. We position HHMS, as they are currently marketed and onboarded, as normalizing pseudo-institutionalization. As an alternative we advocate that the discourse and design of such systems should reflect and re-enforce the varied roles care recipients take in managing their care.

 In this paper, we investigate browsing clutter, which refers to cluttered experiences of users due to buildup of disorganized browser elements and information. We studied what users experience as clutter, what behaviors and factors contribute to the clutter, and what users do when they experience clutter through an interview study (N = 16) and an online survey study (N = 400). Based on our studies, browsing clutter includes the amount of tabs and windows, content of the web pages and interactive elements, navigation, and search process. We identified sources of browsing clutter from task characteristics, such as importance and complexity, to user habits, such as multitasking and tab closing. To reveal the dynamics of browsing clutter, we modeled how browsing clutter is predicted by specific browsing habits and coping strategies. Our model demonstrates how individual forms of clutter are interrelated and altered by behavior. We discuss how browsing clutter relates to information overload.

Cultural Differences in Friendship Network Behaviors: A Snapchat Case Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581074,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13801,"
 Culture shapes people’s behavior, both online and offline. Surprisingly, there is sparse research on how cultural context affects network formation and content consumption on social media. We analyzed the friendship networks and dyadic relations between content producers and consumers across 73 countries through a cultural lens in a closed-network setting. Closed networks allow for intimate bonds and self-expression, providing a natural setting to study cultural differences in behavior. We studied three theoretical frameworks of culture - individualism, relational mobility, and tightness. We found that friendship networks formed across different cultures differ in egocentricity, meaning the connectedness between a user’s friends. Individualism, mobility, and looseness also significantly negatively impact how tie strength affects content consumption. Our findings show how culture affects social media behavior, and we outline how researchers can incorporate this in their work. Our work has implications for content recommendations and can improve content engagement.

 Many tools are designed to support users in maintaining or developing strong time management practices. Abandonment of these specialized tools is common, in favor of returning to a more general-purpose unstructured tool. How can designs leverage the familiarity of general-purpose tools and the advantages of specialized ones? We explore if applying a time-management-specific understanding of conventions and interactions within unstructured plaintext can be a successful approach to designing support for these tasks. We report the results of two field deployments (combined n=29) of “Plan” - a mobile application with a notes-application-based interface designed to support the practice of Time Management Planning. We show that modest, domain-specific modifications of general-purpose designs can facilitate users’ pre-existing workflows and nudge them towards better practices while leaving interfaces familiar and flexible.

Enhancing Blind Visitor's Autonomy in a Science Museum Using an Autonomous Navigation Robot,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581220,0,https://wotipati.github.io/projects/CHI2023_MuseumTour/paper/CHI'23_MuseumTour_preprint.pdf,"
 Enabling blind visitors to explore museum floors while feeling the facility’s atmosphere and increasing their autonomy and enjoyment are imperative for giving them a high-quality museum experience. We designed a science museum exploration system for blind visitors using an autonomous navigation robot. Blind users can control the robot to navigate them toward desired exhibits while playing short audio descriptions along the route. They can also browse detailed explanations on their smartphones and call museum staff if interactive support is needed. Our real-world user study at a science museum during its opening hour revealed that blind participants could explore the museum safely and independently at their own pace. The study also showed that the sighted visitors who saw the participants walking with the robot accepted the assistive robot well. We finally conducted focus group sessions with the blind participants and discussed further requirements toward a more independent museum experience.

 Audio production is a skilled practice that requires mastery in highly complex software and hardware tools. Blind audio producers face a steep learning curve where they must learn multiple inaccessible audio production tools in conjunction with workarounds for screen reader support. Learning audio production is made even more challenging due to a scarcity of educational resources geared towards blind people. Grounded in formative interviews and observations with seven blind audio production instructors, we developed Tutoria11y, an extension for GarageBand to support blind audio producers in creating accessible, interactive tutorials that screen reader users can follow to receive step-by-step guidance and confirmation of their actions. Findings from design exploration sessions with five blind instructors highlight how Tutoria11y can support tutorial creation and augment tutorial playback for blind audio producers. We discuss how we can rethink technology’s role as a means to amplify, rather than replace, the knowledge of disabled experts.

 Existing research on human-AI collaborative decision-making focuses mainly on the interaction between AI and individual decision-makers. There is a limited understanding of how AI may perform in group decision-making. This paper presents a wizard-of-oz study in which two participants and an AI form a committee to rank three English essays. One novelty of our study is that we adopt a speculative design by endowing AI equal power to humans in group decision-making. We enable the AI to discuss and vote equally with other human members. We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still plays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics of the discussion and make progressive contributions. Moreover, the divergent opinions of our participants regarding an “equal AI” shed light on the possible future of human-AI relations.

Sound zone technology enables multiple people to have personal and shared listening experiences without disturbing each other. Methods for constructing sound zones have now matured enough to allow installations outside of experimental laboratories, making it essential for further development to conduct empirical studies about how people adopt, use, and interact with sound zones in, e.g., domestic settings. To that end, we conducted a four-week field study with a sound zone system in five households. Through an inductive reflexive thematic analysis, we identify three themes relating to 1) experiencing sound zones in everyday life, 2) sound zone usage patterns in households, and 3) interacting with sound zones. Based on these themes, we discuss how sound zones can be used to manage sound in homes in new ways to allow for better social coexistence and listening experiences. We present four directions for future HCI research and interaction design to comply with user needs and considerations when using this novel technology.

Head-worn augmented reality (AR) is a hotly pursued and increasingly feasible contender paradigm for replacing or complementing smartphones and watches for continual information consumption. Here, we compare three different AR navigation aids (on-screen compass, on-screen radar and in-world vertical arrows) in a wide-area outdoor user study (n=24) where participants search for hidden virtual target items amongst physical and virtual objects. We analyzed participants’ search task performance, movements, eye-gaze, survey responses and object recall. There were two key findings. First, all navigational aids enhanced search performance relative to a control condition, with some benefit and strongest user preference for in-world arrows. Second, users recalled fewer physical objects than virtual objects in the environment, suggesting reduced awareness of the physical environment. Together, these findings suggest that while navigational aids presented in AR can enhance search task performance, users may pay less attention to the physical environment, which could have undesirable side-effects.

""" I Am a Mirror Dweller"": Probing the Unique Strategies Users Take to Communicate in the Context of Mirrors in Social Virtual Reality",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581464,0,,"
 Increasingly popular social virtual reality (VR) platforms like VRChat created new ways for people to interact with each other, generating dedicated user communities with unique idioms of socializing in an alternative world. In VRChat, users frequently gather in front of mirrors en masse during online interactions. Understanding how user communities deal with the mirror’s unique interactions can generate insights for supporting communication in social VR. In this study, we investigated the mirror’s synergistic effect with avatars on behaviors and dedicated user conversational performance. Qualitative findings indicate that avatar-mediated communication through mirrors provides functions like ensuring synchronization of incarnations, increasing immersion, and enhancing idealized embodiment to express bolder behaviors anonymously. Quantitative studies show that while mirrors improve self-perception, it has a potentially adverse effect on conversational performance, similar to the role of self-viewing in video conferencing. Studying how users interact with mirrors in an immersive environment allows us to explore how digital environments affect spatialized interactions when transported from physical to digital domains.

 Quantified smart buildings increasingly utilise data-rich technologies (such as embedded sensors and personal wearables). Research and development however, rarely addresses occupants’ experiences and expectations in such environments, which is critical for designing ethical and occupant-centred workspaces. To support the design of human-centred smart buildings, a series of 4 workshops was conducted with a total of 27 participants, over 2 months, with occupants of a smart office building. Workshops used discursive (focus group) and projective (design fiction) techniques to qualitatively explore occupants’ perceptions of and concerns around the collection, processing and use of data within the building. Workshop data was thematically analysed, resulting in design implications for improving occupant experience in current smart workplaces, while also contributing implications for increasing the perceivability, accessibility and usability of data in such buildings. Contributing to discourses around Human-Building Interaction the paper concludes with discussion of future research challenges for occupant-centred development of quantified buildings.

In typical experiments to evaluate novel pointing-facilitation techniques, participants are asked to perform a task as rapidly and accurately as possible. However, the balance can differ among participants, and the techniques’ effectiveness would change if the majority of participants give weight to either speed or accuracy. We investigated the effects of three subjective biases (emphasizing speed, neutral, and emphasizing accuracy) on the evaluation results of pointing-facilitation techniques, namely Bubble Cursor and Bayesian Touch Criterion (BTC). The results indicate that Bubble Cursor outperformed the baseline in terms of movement time and error rate under all bias conditions, while BTC underperformed a simpler target-prediction technique, which was an inconsistent outcome to the original study. Examining multiple biases enables researchers to discuss the (dis)advantages of novel or existing techniques more precisely, which can be beneficial to reach a more reliable conclusion.

Impressions and Strategies of Academic Advisors When Using a Grade Prediction Tool During Term Planning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581575,0,https://inria.hal.science/hal-04132566/file/CHI_2023_Revised.pdf,"
Academic advising brings numerous benefits to the mission of Higher Education Institutions. One central and challenging duty of advisors is course recommendation for term planning. This task requires both knowledge of the study programs as well as a thorough analysis of the students’ unique circumstances. Limited time and a large student population make this task overwhelming. As a result, an important body of research has sought to expedite term planning via data-oriented decision-support tools. The impact of such tools on students has been extensively studied. However, the advisors’ perspective remains largely unexplored. We contribute to redressing this gap by studying how a grade prediction tool shapes academic advisors’ approach to course recommendation. We found that while the advisors’ usual strategies tend to prevail, their recommendations largely depend on the advisee’s historical performance. That said, advisors also acknowledge the limitations of grades as a measure of academic success.

 Robotic avatars can help disabled people extend their reach in interacting with the world. Technological advances make it possible for individuals to embody multiple avatars simultaneously. However, existing studies have been limited to laboratory conditions and did not involve disabled participants. In this paper, we present a real-world implementation of a parallel control system allowing disabled workers in a café to embody multiple robotic avatars at the same time to carry out different tasks. Our data corpus comprises semi-structured interviews with workers, customer surveys, and videos of café operations. Results indicate that the system increases workers’ agency, enabling them to better manage customer journeys. Parallel embodiment and transitions between avatars create multiple interaction loops where the links between disabled workers and customers remain consistent, but the intermediary avatar changes. Based on our observations, we theorize that disabled individuals possess specific competencies that increase their ability to manage multiple avatar bodies.

Error rates (ERs) in target-pointing tasks are typically modelled in two steps: predicting the click-point variability (σ) based on target sizes and then computing the probability that a click falls outside a target. This is an indirect approach if the researcher’s purpose is to achieve the accurate prediction of ERs because the model coefficients are optimized to predict σ accurately in the first step. We compared the prediction accuracies of this method with a more direct technique in which the coefficients used for σ are determined in such a way as to optimize the closeness between observed and predicted ERs. Our re-analysis of eight datasets from mouse- and touch-based pointing studies showed that the latter approach consistently outperforms the conventional one if the starting values for the parameter search are appropriate (which can be achieved by hyperparameter optimization), thus enabling the interface configuration on the basis of accurately predicted ERs.

In the past few years, the widespread use of 3D printing technology enables the growth of the market of 3D printed products. On Esty, a website focused on handmade items, hundreds of individual entrepreneurs are selling their 3D printed products. Inspired by the positive effects of machine-readable tags, like barcodes, on daily product marketing, we propose AnisoTag, a novel tagging method to encode data on the 2D surface of 3D printed objects based on reflection anisotropy. AnisoTag has an unobtrusive appearance and much lower extraction computational complexity, contributing to a lightweight low-cost tagging system for individual entrepreneurs. On AnisoTag, data are encoded by the proposed tool as reflective anisotropic microstructures, which would reflect distinct illumination patterns when irradiating by collimated laser. Based on it, we implement a real-time detection prototype with inexpensive hardware to determine the reflected illumination pattern and decode data according to their mapping. We evaluate AnisoTag with various 3D printer brands, filaments, and printing parameters, demonstrating its superior usability, accessibility, and reliability for practical usage.

Grounded in the theory of distributed cognition and motivational theories, our study examined how learning happens in each condition from students’ learning outcomes, behaviors, and perceptions. Our result indicates that VR facilitates students’ long-term retention to learn by cultivating their longer visual attention and fostering a higher sense of immersion, though students’ short-term retention remains the same across all conditions.

transPAF: Rendering Omnidirectional Impact Feedback with Dynamic Point of Application of Force All Round a Controller,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581092,0,,"
 Impact force is common haptic feedback on virtual reality (VR) controllers, such as hitting objects with weapons or rackets. It applies to different points of application of force (PAFs) and directions in varied scenarios. For example, using weapons with different shapes, e.g., a sword and a pickaxe, using a weapon in different ways, e.g., stabbing and slashing with a sword, or a ball flying and hitting a racket in different directions cause different PAFs and/or force directions. Therefore, to achieve realistic VR experiences, rendering dynamic PAF and force direction is essential. Although previous works have proposed the concept of dynamic PAF, the PAF is only in a limited space and without dynamic force direction. Therefore, we propose a controller, transPAF, to render omnidirectional impact feedback with dynamic PAF all round the controller for versatile VR scenarios. transPAF consists of a controller, a semicircular track, a linear track, and an impactor, which are all rotatable. The impactor can move to any position in a sphere, which means the whole 3D space all round the controller, and rotate in any direction. Therefore, dynamic PAF and force direction are achieved and independent to each other. We conducted a just-noticeable difference (JND) study to understand users’ distinguishability in position and direction, separately. A VR experience study was further performed to verify that feedback from transPAF with dynamic PAF and force direction enhances the VR experiences and demonstrate some applications for transPAF.

 Technology, especially the smartphone, is villainized for taking meaning and time away from in-person interactions and secluding people into “digital bubbles”. We believe this is not an intrinsic property of digital gadgets, but evidence of a lack of imagination in technology design. Leveraging augmented reality (AR) toward this end allows us to create experiences for multiple people, their pets, and their environments. In this work, we explore the design of AR technology that “piggybacks” on everyday leisure to foster co-located interactions among close ties (with other people and pets). We designed, developed, and deployed three such AR applications, and evaluated them through a 41-participant and 19-pet user study. We gained key insights about the ability of AR to spur and enrich interaction in new channels, the importance of customization, and the challenges of designing for the physical aspects of AR devices (e.g., holding smartphones). These insights guide design implications for the novel research space of co-located AR.

Menstruation and fertility tracking applications are of increasing concern in HCI research, as their use becomes more widespread. Methods are needed to understand how such applications become entangled in everyday practices. While these apps promise increased self-knowledge of reproductive potential by collecting intimate data about reproductive bodies, they also restrict the knowledge produced about users’ bodies and embed normative understandings of reproduction and gender. In this paper, we scrutinize the normativities of reproductive bodies by deploying the “walkthrough method” to uncover sociotechnical entanglements of the menstruation and fertility apps Clue, Tilly, and Drip. We discuss how the walkthrough method contributes to HCI's methodological repertoire for studying intimate bodily tracking apps and unpacking their normativities.

No Pie in the (Digital) Sky: Co-Imagining the Food Metaverse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581305,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581305,"
 Human behaviour and habits co-evolve with technology, and the metaverse is poised to become a key player in reshaping how we live our everyday life. Given the importance of food in our daily lives, we ask: how will our relationships with food be transformed by the metaverse, and what are the promises and pitfalls of this technology? To answer this, we propose a co-design study that reveals the important elements people value in their daily interactions with food. We then present a speculative catalogue of novel metaverse food experiences, and insights from discussing these ideas with food designers, anthropologists and metaverse experts. Our work aims to provide designers with inspirations for building a metaverse that: provides inclusive opportunities for the future of food; helps re-discover the forgotten or lost knowledge about food; facilitates the exploration, excitement and joy of eating; and reinvigorates the ways that food can soothe and heal.

"On Selective, Mutable and Dialogic XAI: a Review of What Users Say about Different Types of Interactive Explanations",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581314,0,https://hal.science/hal-04115961/document,"
 Explainability (XAI) has matured in recent years to provide more human-centered explanations of AI-based decision systems. While static explanations remain predominant, interactive XAI has gathered momentum to support the human cognitive process of explaining. However, the evidence regarding the benefits of interactive explanations is unclear. In this paper, we map existing findings by conducting a detailed scoping review of 48 empirical studies in which interactive explanations are evaluated with human users. We also create a classification of interactive techniques specific to XAI and group the resulting categories according to their role in the cognitive process of explanation: ""selective"", ""mutable"" or ""dialogic"". We identify the effects of interactivity on several user-based metrics. We find that interactive explanations improve perceived usefulness and performance of the human+AI team but take longer. We highlight conflicting results regarding cognitive load and overconfidence. Lastly, we describe underexplored areas including measuring curiosity or learning or perturbing outcomes.

Manifesting Breath: Empirical Evidence for the Integration of Shape-changing Biofeedback-based Artefacts within Digital Mental Health Interventions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581188,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581188,"
 Digital interventions are often used to support people with mental health conditions, but low engagement frequently reduces their effectiveness. We investigate the use of a Physical Artefact for Well-being Support (PAWS) to improve engagement and effectiveness of an audio-only guided well-being intervention. Through our handheld shape-changing biofeedback-based PAWS, users can synchronously feel their breath via kinaesthetic haptic feedback. By evaluating our device in a randomised-controlled experimental paradigm (N=58), we demonstrate significant reductions in physiological and subjective (self-reported) anxiety compared to an audio-only control. Our findings conclude that synchronous interactions with one‘s own physiological data via the PAWS, improves engagement and effectiveness of an intervention.

 Despite decades long establishment of effective tutoring principles, no adaptive tutoring system has been developed and open-sourced to the research community. The absence of such a system inhibits researchers from replicating adaptive learning studies and extending and experimenting with various tutoring system design directions. For this reason, adaptive learning research is primarily conducted on a small number of proprietary platforms. In this work, we aim to democratize adaptive learning research with the introduction of the first open-source adaptive tutoring system based on Intelligent Tutoring System principles. The system, we call Open Adaptive Tutor (OATutor), has been iteratively developed over three years with field trials in classrooms drawing feedback from students, teachers, and researchers. The MIT-licensed source code includes three creative commons (CC BY) textbooks worth of algebra problems, with tutoring supports authored by the OATutor project. Knowledge Tracing, an A/B testing framework, and LTI support are included.

We designed DuoRhythmo specifically to be utilized for eye tracking and optimized it for head- and computer mouse interaction, as well using a user-centered design approach. Together with five PALS, we completed a mixed-methods evaluation to assess the accessibility of DuoRhythmo. Participants described the CADMI using the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit (MDT) as fun, empowering, accessible, easy to use, engaging, and stimulating and gave an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 79.5.

Identifying Multimodal Context Awareness Requirements for Supporting User Interaction with Procedural Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581006,0,,"
 Following along how-to videos requires alternating focus between understanding procedural video instructions and performing them. Examining how to support these continuous context switches for the user has been largely unexplored. In this paper, we describe a user study with thirty participants who performed an hour-long cooking task while interacting with a wizard-of-oz hands-free interactive system that is aware of both their cooking progress and environment contexts. Through analysis of the session scripts, we identify a dichotomy between participant query differences and workflow alignment similarities, under-studied interactions that require AI functionality beyond video navigation alone, and queries that call for multimodal sensing of a user’s environment. By understanding the assistant experience through the participants’ interactions, we identify design implications for a smart assistant that can discern a user’s task completion flow and personal characteristics, accommodate requests within and external to the task domain, and support nonvoice-based queries.

Factors of Haptic Experience across Multiple Haptic Modalities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581514,0,https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/18947/Anwar_Ahmed.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y,"
 Haptic Experience (HX) is a proposed set of quality criteria useful to haptics, with prior evidence for a 5-factor model with vibrotactile feedback. We report on an ongoing process of scale development to measure HX, and explore whether these criteria hold when applied to more diverse devices, including vibrotactile, force feedback, surface haptics, and mid-air haptics. From an in-person user study with 430 participants, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), we extract an 11-item and 4-factor model (Realism, Harmony, Involvement, Expressivity) with only a partial overlap to the previous model. We compare this model to the previous vibrotactile model, finding that the new 4-factor model is more generalized and can guide attributes or applications of new haptic systems. Our findings suggest that HX may vary depending on the modalities used in an application, but these four factors are general constructs that might overlap with modality-specific concepts of HX. These factors can inform designers about the right quality criteria to use when designing or evaluating haptic experiences for multiple modalities.

 Geospatial data is playing an increasingly critical role in the work of Earth and climate scientists, social scientists, and data journalists exploring spatiotemporal change in our environment and societies. However, existing software and programming tools for geospatial analysis and visualization are challenging to learn and difficult to use. The aim of this work is to identify the unmet computing needs of the diverse and expanding community of geospatial data users. We conducted a contextual inquiry study (n = 25) with domain experts using geospatial data in their current work. Through a thematic analysis, we found that participants struggled to (1) find and transform geospatial data to satisfy spatiotemporal constraints, (2) understand the behavior of geospatial operators, (3) track geospatial data provenance, and (4) explore the cartographic design space. These findings suggest design opportunities for developers and designers of geospatial analysis and visualization systems.

 Remote conferencing systems are increasingly used to supplement or even replace in-person teaching. However, prevailing conferencing systems restrict the teacher’s representation to a webcam live-stream, hamper the teacher’s use of body-language, and result in students’ decreased sense of co-presence and participation. While Virtual Reality (VR) systems may increase student engagement, the teacher may not have the time or expertise to conduct the lecture in VR. To address this issue and bridge the requirements between students and teachers, we have developed Tutor In-sight, a Mixed Reality (MR) avatar augmented into the student’s workspace based on four design requirements derived from the existing literature, namely: integrated virtual with physical space, improved teacher’s co-presence through avatar, direct attention with auto-generated body language, and usable workflow for teachers. Two user studies were conducted from the perspectives of students and teachers to determine the advantages of Tutor In-sight in comparison to two existing conferencing systems, Zoom (video-based) and Mozilla Hubs (VR-based). The participants of both studies favoured Tutor In-sight. Among others, this main finding indicates that Tutor In-sight satisfied the needs of both teachers and students. In addition, the participants’ feedback was used to empirically determine the four main teacher requirements and the four main student requirements in order to improve the future design of MR educational tools.

Furthermore, the new gestures elicited in our replication present different articulation characteristics in terms of their structure, complexity, symmetry, and locale, compared to the gestures from the original study. Our results have implications for the theory and practice of gesture elicitation studies, for which we provide several recommendations for researchers and practitioners.

Despite the common use of rule-based tools for online content moderation, human moderators still spend a lot of time monitoring them to ensure they work as intended. Based on surveys and interviews with Reddit moderators who use AutoModerator, we identified the main challenges in reducing false positives and false negatives of automated rules: not being able to estimate the actual effect of a rule in advance and having difficulty figuring out how the rules should be updated. To address these issues, we built ModSandbox, a novel virtual sandbox system that detects possible false positives and false negatives of a rule and visualizes which part of the rule is causing issues. We conducted a comparative, between-subject study with online content moderators to evaluate the effect of ModSandbox in improving automated rules. Results show that ModSandbox can support quickly finding possible false positives and false negatives of automated rules and guide moderators to improve them to reduce future errors.

School refusal is a complex issue which typically develops in adolescence, often in the context of anxiety and depressive disorders. While parents and educators play a critical role in supporting these adolescents, they need guidance to work together to overcome the problem. Our study explores how technology can be designed to help parents and educators work together in supporting adolescents who refuse school. We first conducted 14 interviews with parents which highlighted that empathic understanding and communication between parents and the educators is key to supporting adolescents with school refusal. Subsequently, we conducted co-design workshops with three parents, three adolescents and five educators. Our workshop findings show that reactive and problem-focused communication can undermine trust-building and progress towards supporting the adolescent. Drawing on these findings, we formulate design implications that can enable empathic parent-adolescent-educator partnerships, provide holistic support for parents, and facilitate individual tailoring for diverse parent-adolescent journeys.

Enhancing Older Adults' Gesture Typing Experience Using the T9 Keyboard on Small Touchscreen Devices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581105,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03626,"
 Older adults increasingly adopt small-screen devices, but limited motor dexterity hinders their ability to type effectively. While a 9-key (T9) keyboard allocates larger space to each key, it is shared by multiple consecutive letters. Consequently, users must interrupt their gestures when typing consecutive letters, leading to inefficiencies and poor user experience. Thus, we proposed a novel keyboard that leverages the currently unused key 1 to duplicate letters from the previous key, allowing the entry of consecutive letters without interruptions. A user study with 12 older adults showed that it significantly outperformed the T9 with wiggle gesture in typing speed, KSPC, insertion errors, and deletes per word while achieving comparable performance as the conventional T9. Repeating the typing tasks with 12 young adults found that the advantages of the novel T9 were consistent or enhanced. We also provide error analysis and design considerations for improving gesture typing on T9 for older adults.

Through thematic analysis of qualitative data, we identify seven challenges our participants experienced when using social media, and a set of imagined features that represent their vision of how design could better support their social media use. We discuss how mainstream social media platforms are primarily designed to address neurotypical sensitivities, and fail autistic adults through lack of user control, inadequate mechanisms for expressing tone and intention, and an orientation towards phatic interactions. To close, we outline how autistic sociality can inspire the design of kinder and more considerate social media platforms.

Exam Eustress: Designing Brief Online Interventions for Helping Students Identify Positive Aspects of Stress,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581368,0,,"
Stress reappraisal interventions try to shift students’ negative perceptions towards eustress, stress that can be beneficial, and help them perform better. However, it is less clear how to present them to users as online interventions that are brief, voluntary, and scale well in real-world contexts. We explore the design of online exam eustress interventions by generating six design factors (D1-6) that reinforce a core reappraisal message (D0), and evaluate them through: (i) user interviews (N = 20) revealing six findings (F1-6) on the importance of elaboration, layout, modality, and source of intervention content; (ii) a field experiment (N = 1283) showing a significant positive effect on exam scores (p = 0.003). Subgroup analyses indicate a significant effect for first-year but not for upper-year students, and no detectable gender differences. Our work offers insight into how students interact with online mindset interventions and design considerations for incorporating them into large courses.

 As we become increasingly entangled with digital technologies, the boundary between human and machine is progressively blurring. Adopting a performative, posthumanist perspective resolves this ambiguity by proposing that such boundaries are not predetermined, rather they are enacted within a certain material configuration. Using this approach, dubbed ‘Entanglement HCI’, this paper presents Message Ritual – a novel, integrated AI system that encourages the re-framing of memory through machine generated poetics. Embodied within a domestic table lamp, the system listens in on conversations occurring within the home, drawing out key topics and phrases of the day and reconstituting them through machine generated poetry, delivered to household members via SMS upon waking each morning. Participants across four households were asked to live with the lamp over a two week period. We present a diffractive analysis exploring how the lamp becomes with participants and discuss the implications of this method for future HCI research.

 Hand-drawn sketches and sketch colourization are the most laborious but necessary steps for fashion designers to design exquisite clothes, especially when the fashion design requires distinctive and personal characteristics from designer style. This paper presents an artificial intelligent aided fashion design system, namely StyleMe, to support the automatic generation of clothing sketches with designer style. Given the clothing pictures specified by the designer, StyleMe can use deep learning based generative model to generate clothing sketches that are consistent with the designer style. The system also supports intelligent colourization on clothing sketch by style transfer, according to specified styles from the real fashion images. Through a series of performance evaluations and user studies, we found that our system can generate effective clothing sketches as good as fashion designers’ human work, and significantly improve the efficiency of fashion design with its sketch colourization method.

Interactive Context-Preserving Color Highlighting for Multiclass Scatterplots,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580734,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05368,"
Color is one of the main visual channels used for highlighting elements of interest in visualization. However, in multi-class scatterplots, color highlighting often comes at the expense of degraded color discriminability. In this paper, we argue for context-preserving highlighting during the interactive exploration of multi-class scatterplots to achieve desired pop-out effects, while maintaining good perceptual separability among all classes and consistent color mapping schemes under varying points of interest. We do this by first generating two contrastive color mapping schemes with large and small contrasts to the background. Both schemes maintain good perceptual separability among all classes and ensure that when colors from the two palettes are assigned to the same class, they have a high color consistency in color names. We then interactively combine these two schemes to create a dynamic color mapping for highlighting different points of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness through crowd-sourced experiments and case studies.

Fact-checking messages are shared or ignored subjectively. Users tend to seek like-minded information and ignore information that conflicts with their preexisting beliefs, leaving like-minded misinformation uncontrolled on the Internet. To understand the factors that distract fact-checking engagement, we investigated the psychological characteristics associated with users’ selective avoidance of clicking uncongenial facts. In a pre-registered experiment, we measured participants’ (N = 506) preexisting beliefs about COVID-19-related news stimuli. We then examined whether they clicked on fact-checking links to false news that they believed to be accurate. We proposed an index that divided participants into fact-avoidance and fact-exposure groups using a mathematical baseline. The results indicated that 43% of participants selectively avoided clicking on uncongenial facts, keeping 93% of their false beliefs intact. Reflexiveness is the psychological characteristic that predicts selective avoidance. We discuss susceptibility to click bias that prevents users from utilizing fact-checking websites and the implications for future design.

Designing for Uncontrollability: Drawing Inspiration from the Blessing Companion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581421,1,,"
 This paper presents an inspirational concept for companion technology design, uncontrollability, and a corresponding artefact, the Blessing Companion. Both originated from a research through design project exploring companion technologies for blessing rituals. We established an exchange with Protestant theologians, explored believers’ experiences of blessings, co-speculated on potential technologies, and refined the resulting ideas through ideation, prototyping, and testing. Inspired by believers’ descriptions of blessing experiences as not plannable, predictable, controllable, or enforceable, we adopted the concept of uncontrollability, explored how it might be implemented in companion technologies, and designed the Blessing Companion. The Blessing Companion embodies uncontrollability through its ambiguous appearance and (partly) uncontrollable behaviour. It thus stands in contrast to the prevailing on-demand and user-driven interaction paradigms. We discuss how uncontrollability can be reflected in content, form, and interaction, highlight respective possibilities for companion technologies, and reflect on the Blessing Companion as an example of designing for religious rituals.

Competence Assessment by Chunk Hierarchy Evaluation with Transcription-tasks (CACHET) was proposed by Cheng [14]. It analyses micro-behaviors captured during cycles of stimulus viewing and copying in order to probe chunk structures in memory. This study extends CACHET by applying it to the domain of graphs and charts. Since drawing strategies are diverse, a new interactive stimulus presentation method is introduced: Transcription with Incremental Presentation of the Stimulus (TIPS). TIPS aims to reduce strategy variations that mask the chunking signal by giving users manual element-by-element control over the display of the stimulus. The potential of TIPS, is shown by the analysis of six participants transcriptions of stimuli of different levels of familiarity and complexity that reveal clear signals of chunking. To understand how the chunk size and individual differences drive TIPS measurements, a CPM-GOMS model was constructed to formalize the cognitive process involved in stimulus comprehension and chunk creation.

We observed themes framing the queer community’s understanding of queer expression, wearable technology, and wearable technology for queer users. Providing design considerations and discussions on the potential of our methods, our work enables the creation of wearable technologies that offer meaningful user experiences for the queer community.

Accounting for technologies’ unintended consequences—whether they are misinformation on social media or issues of sustainability and social justice—increasingly requires HCI to consider technology design at a societal-level scale. At this scale, public and corporate policies play a critical role in shaping technologies and user behaviors. However, the research and practices around tech and policy design have largely been held separate. How can technology design and policies better inform and coordinate with each other in generating safe new technologies? What new solutions might emerge when HCI practitioners design technology and its policies simultaneously to account for its societal impacts? This workshop addresses these questions. It will 1) identify disciplines and areas of expertise needed for a tighter, more proactive technology-and-policy-design integration, 2) launch a community of researchers, educators, and designers interested in this integration, 3) identify and publish an HCI research and education agenda towards designing technologies and technology policies simultaneously.

Defining Patterns for a Conversational Web,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581145,0,,"
 Conversational agents are emerging as channels for a natural and accessible interaction with digital services. Their benefits span across a wide range of usage scenarios and address visual impairments and any situational impairments that may take advantage of voice-based interactions. A few works highlighted the potential and the feasibility of adopting conversational agents for making the Web truly accessible for everyone. Yet, there is still a lack of concrete guidance in designing conversational experiences for browsing the Web. This paper illustrates a human-centered process that involved 26 blind and visually impaired people to investigate their difficulties when using assistive technology for accessing the Web, and their attitudes and preferences on adopting conversational agents. In response to the identified challenges, the paper introduces patterns for conversational Web browsing.

 The rich detail generated by qualitative research is essential for understanding workplace contexts and processes for organizational development. This can be a highly involved and extensive process, thus limiting the number of people who can normally be allowed to fully participate. This is especially problematic when it comes to workplace collaboration and development, as it means that a large number of voices are not considered and heard. In this paper, we provide and implement a novel semi-automated approach that enables large-scale qualitative research. This was done within the context of developing a new organizational strategy for a large and diverse multi-lingual international development organization. We included over 150 different stakeholders whilst enabling their views to be collected and analyzed in depth. This case study demonstrates how to effectively implement qualitative interview research at scale with an application to the employee voice setting, contributing the tools and means to achieve this.

PunchPrint: Creating Composite Fiber-Filament Craft Artifacts by Integrating Punch Needle Embroidery and 3D Printing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581298,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581298,"
New printing strategies have enabled 3D-printed materials that imitate traditional textiles. These filament-based textiles are easy to fabricate but lack the look and feel of fiber textiles. We seek to augment 3D-printed textiles with needlecraft to produce composite materials that integrate the programmability of additive fabrication with the richness of traditional textile craft. We present PunchPrint: a technique for integrating fiber and filament in a textile by combining punch needle embroidery and 3D printing. Using a toolpath that imitates textile weave structure, we print a flexible fabric that provides a substrate for punch needle production. We evaluate our material’s robustness through tensile strength and needle compatibility tests. We integrate our technique into a parametric design tool and produce functional artifacts that show how PunchPrint broadens punch needle craft by reducing labor in small, detailed artifacts, enabling the integration of openings and multiple yarn weights, and scaffolding soft 3D structures.

 Robots are entering our lives and workplaces as companions and teammates. Though much research has been done on how to interact with robots, teach robots and improve task performance, an open frontier for HCI/HRI research is how to establish a working relationship with a robot in the first place. Studies that explore the early stages of human-robot interaction are an emerging area of research. Simultaneously, there is resurging interest in how human-animal interaction could inform human-robot interaction. We present a first examination of early stage human-horse interaction through the lens of human-robot interaction, thus connecting these two areas. Following Strauss’ approach, we conduct a thematic analysis of data from three sources gathered over a year of field work: observations, interviews and journal entries. We contribute design guidelines based on our analyses and findings.

Steering Stories: Confronting Narratives of Driving Automation through Contestational Artifacts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581194,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581194,"
 In this paper, we problematize popular narratives of driving automation. Whether positive or negative, these propagate simplistic assumptions about human abilities and reinforce technocratic approaches to mobility innovation. We build on narrative approaches to participatory research and adversarial design, to explore how design-led confrontation can create opportunities for reflection on implicit assumptions and narratives that stakeholders may refer to when discussing and making decisions about automated driving technologies. Specifically, we discuss the results of four focus groups where we used contestational artifacts to promote critical discussions and confront taken-for-granted beliefs among stakeholders. We reflect on the results to distill methodological insight and design recommendations for conducting adversarial participatory design research as a way towards confronting dominant narratives. Together with the methodological approach, the main contribution of this work, we also provide a set of narrative tensions that can be used to question common beliefs surrounding automated driving futures.

 The ubiquity of devices connected to the internet raises concerns about the security and privacy of smart homes. The effectiveness of interventions to support secure user behaviors is limited by a lack of validated instruments to measure relevant psychological constructs, such as self-efficacy – the belief that one is able to perform certain behaviors. We developed and validated the Cybersecurity Self-Efficacy in Smart Homes (CySESH) scale, a 12-item unidimensional measure of domain-specific self-efficacy beliefs, across five studies (N = 1247). Three pilot studies generated and refined an item pool. We report evidence from one initial and one major, preregistered validation study for (1) excellent reliability (α = 0.90), (2) convergent validity with self-efficacy in information security (rSEIS = 0.64, p < .001), and (3) discriminant validity with outcome expectations (rOE = 0.26, p < .001), self-esteem (rRSE = 0.17, p < .001), and optimism (rLOT-R = 0.18, p < .001). We discuss CySESH’s potential to advance future HCI research on cybersecurity, practitioner user assessments, and implications for consumer protection policy.

Keep it Real: Investigating Driver-Cyclist Interaction in Real-World Traffic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581049,0,,"
Cyclists encounter drivers in many traffic scenarios; good communication is key to avoiding collisions. Little is known about everyday driver-cyclist interaction and communication. This is important in designing Automated Vehicles (AVs) that must drive safely around cyclists. We explored driver-cyclist interaction across diverse scenarios through in-the-wild observations (N = 414) and a naturalistic study involving cyclists wearing eye-trackers (N = 12). Results showed cyclists attended to road markings and traffic signs in controlled traffic scenarios but to vehicle sides and windows in uncontrolled encounters. Interactions were unlikely at controlled intersections, but various techniques were used to negotiate right-of-way in uncontrolled scenarios, e.g. cyclists used arm gestures and shoulder checks to communicate their intent and awareness when lane merging. Drivers communicated these through on-vehicle signals and head movements at roundabouts. We discuss the implications of driver-cyclist interaction behaviour on AV interaction design and offer insights into system requirements to support cyclists riding in traffic.

 User models play an important role in interaction design, supporting automation of interaction design choices. In order to do so, model parameters must be estimated from user data. While very large amounts of user data are sometimes required, recent research has shown how experiments can be designed so as to gather data and infer parameters as efficiently as possible, thereby minimising the data requirement. In the current article, we investigate a variant of these methods that amortises the computational cost of designing experiments by training a policy for choosing experimental designs with simulated participants. Our solution learns which experiments provide the most useful data for parameter estimation by interacting with in-silico agents sampled from the model space thereby using synthetic data rather than vast amounts of human data. The approach is demonstrated for three progressively complex models of pointing.

Social Support for Mobile Security: Comparing Close Connections and Community Volunteers in a Field Experiment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581183,0,,"
People regularly rely on social support from family, friends, and the public when mitigating security and privacy risks, even if mainstream technologies hardly support these interactions. In this paper, we evaluated Meerkat, a mobile application that allows users to receive support through screenshot capturing, marking, and messaging. In a field experiment (n = 65), we tested how Meerkat helps users face phishing attempts and examined it by receiving help from close social connections and community volunteers. Our findings show that while users could learn from both types of helpers, they were significantly more willing to rely on advice from close connections. We evaluate several criteria for successful support interactions, showing that learning is significantly correlated with specific properties of the support interaction, such as the length of the messages. We conclude the paper by discussing how our findings can be used to design community-based applications.

 Inclusive workplaces require mutual efforts between neurotypical (NT) and neurodivergent (ND) employees to understand one another’s viewpoints and experiences. Currently, the majority of inclusivity training places the burden of change on NDs to conform to NT social-behavioral standards. Our research examines moving toward a more equal effort distribution by exploring virtual reality (VR) design opportunities to build NTs’ understanding of ND workplace experiences. Using participatory design, including generative toolkits and design meetings, we surfaced two main themes that could bridge gaps in understanding: (1) NTs’ recognition of NDs’ strengths and efforts at work, and (2) NTs’ understanding of NDs’ differences. We present a strengths-based assessment of ND traits in the workplace, focusing on how workplaces can support NDs’ success. Finally, we propose VR simulation designs that communicate these themes to represent ND experiences, emphasizing their strengths and viewpoints so that NT co-workers can better empathize and accommodate them.

We present Thought Bubbles as an approach for eliciting mental models and an avenue for understanding players’ mental model development in interactive virtual environments. We demonstrate the use of Thought Bubbles in two experimental studies involving 250 participants playing a supply chain game. In our analyses, we rely on Situation Awareness (SA) levels, including perception, comprehension, and projection, and show how experimental manipulations such as disruptions and information sharing shape players’ mental models and drive their decisions depending on their behavioral profile. Our results provide evidence for the use of thought bubbles in uncovering cognitive aspects of behavior by indicating how disruption location and availability of information affect people’s mental model development and influence their decisions.

Challenging but Connective: Large-Scale Characteristics of Synchronous Collaboration Across Time Zones,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581141,0,,"
 Organizations are becoming increasingly distributed and many need to collaborate synchronously over great geographical distances. Despite a rich body of literature on spatially-distanced meetings, gaps remain in our understanding of temporally-distanced meetings. Here, we characterize cross time zone collaborations by analyzing 20 million meetings scheduled at a multinational corporation, Microsoft, supported by a survey on how 130 employees perceive their scheduling needs. We find that cross time zone meetings are closely associated with scheduling patterns around early morning and late evening hours, which are challenging and discordant with employees’ stated temporal preferences. Additionally, the burdens of meeting across time boundaries are asymmetrically distributed among workers at different levels of the organization and different geolocations. Nonetheless, we further observe evidence that cross time zone attendees are organizationally distant and diverse, suggesting that addressing these challenges by limiting meetings would disafford employees the opportunities to connect. We conclude by sharing opportunities for facilitating cross time zone meetings that foster healthier global collaborations.

Our findings showed potential challenges to engage at-risk students in the agenda of Computational Empowerment. We propose three recommendations and future directions to scaffold at-risk students’ learning about intelligent technologies in remote contexts: (1) support the development of agency through the engagement of contexts-for-action; (2) reduce the complexity of remote communication through creative and bodily engagement; (3) reflect upon forces that marginalize oneself in a digitized society.

ExpresSense has been tested on different users in lab-scaled and large-scale studies for both posed as well as natural expressions. By achieving a classification accuracy of over various basic expressions, we discuss the potential of a standalone smartphone to sense expressions through acoustic sensing.

"Bits are Cheap, Atoms are Expensive: Critiquing the Turn Towards Tangibility in HCI",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3582744,1,,"
Ever since the introduction of the desktop interface, HCI has strived to develop alternatives that make interacting with computers more physical, embodied and ubiquitous. In particular, the vision of tangible user interfaces (TUI) has had a large impact and inspired an extensive body of research over the last 25 years. However, despite strong interest from the research community, commercial success has been limited. We argue that the reason is that whereas graphical user interfaces are inherently cheap, physical interfaces are expensive: to create; to control; to modify; to maintain; and to mass-produce and distribute. This also leads to TUIs being highly problematic from a sustainability viewpoint. Finally, as a way to combine the best of both worlds, we introduce a vision of liberated pixels, which are visual output elements that are perceivable, addressable, and persistent in the physical world.

 Stuttering is a speech disorder influencing over 70 million people worldwide, including 13 million in China. It causes low self-esteem among other detrimental effects on people who stutter (PwS). Although prior work has explored approaches to assist PwS, they primarily focused on western contexts. In our formative study, we found unique practices and challenges among Chinese PwS. We then iteratively designed an online tool, CoPracTter, to support Chinese PwS practicing speaking fluency with 1) targeted stress-inducing practice scenarios, 2) real-time speech indicators, and 3) personalized timely feedback from the community. We further conducted a seven-day deployment study (N=11) to understand how participants utilized these key features. To our knowledge, it is the first time such a prototype was designed and tested for a long time with multiple PwS participants online simultaneously. Results indicate that personalized practice with targeted scenarios and timely feedback from a supportive community assisted PwS in speaking fluently, staying positive, and facing similar real-life circumstances.

Revived interest in lunar exploration is heralding a new generation of design solutions in support of human operations on the Moon. While space system design has traditionally been guided by prototype deployments in analogue studies, the resource-intensive nature of this approach has largely precluded application of proficient user-centered design (UCD) methods from human-computer interaction (HCI). This paper explores possible use of Virtual Reality (VR) to simulate analogue studies in lab settings and thereby bring to bear UCD in this otherwise engineering-dominated field. Drawing on the ongoing development of the European Large Logistics Lander, we have recreated a prospective lunar operational scenario in VR and evaluated it with a group of astronauts and space experts (n=20). Our qualitative findings demonstrate the efficacy of VR in facilitating UCD, enabling efficient contextual inquiries and improving project team coordination. We conclude by proposing future directions to further exploit VR in lunar systems design.

ReadingQuizMaker enables instructors to decide when and which NLP models to use, select the input to the models, and edit the outcomes. In an evaluation study, instructors found the resulting questions to be comparable to their previously designed quizzes. Instructors praised ReadingQuizMaker for its ease of use, and considered the NLP suggestions to be satisfying and helpful. We compared ReadingQuizMaker with a control condition where instructors were given automatically generated questions to edit. Instructors showed a strong preference for the human-AI teaming approach provided by ReadingQuizMaker. Our findings suggest the importance of giving users control and showing an immediate preview of AI outcomes when providing AI support.

'Specially For You'–Examining the Barnum Effect's Influence on the Perceived Quality of System Recommendations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580656,0,,"
 The ‘Barnum effect’ is a psychological phenomenon under which people assign higher quality ratings to personality descriptions developed ‘specially for you’ than the same descriptions described as ‘generally true of people.’ This effect suggests that recommender interfaces could elevate the perceived quality of recommendations simply by indicating that they are explicitly personalised. We therefore conducted a crowd-sourced experiment (n=492) that examined the perceived quality of personalised versus non-personalised movie recommendations for good and bad movies – importantly, the actual recommendations were identical, and were merely presented as being either personalised or not. Contrary to the Barnum effect, results showed numerically lower mean quality scores for personalised recommendations, but with no significant difference. Our findings suggest that Barnum-like effects of personalisation have at most a small influence on perceived quality, and that designers should not rely on this effect to improve user experience (despite online design guidance suggesting the opposite).

The toolkit consists of a survey template with embedded JavaScript, a JavaScript library embedded in the HTML web pages, and scripts to analyze the collected data. No special programming skills are required to set up a study or match survey data and user interaction data after data collection. We empirically validated the software in a laboratory and a field study. We conclude that this extension, even in its preliminary version, has the potential to make online user interaction studies (e.g., with crowdsourced participants) accessible to a broader range of researchers.

We investigated the effect of prolonged HWD use on the experience of the supervising anesthesiologists and their co-workers using interviews and repeated observations. A reflexive thematic analysis showed (1) interaction and mindset changes over time, (2) information on the HWD is more than numbers, (3) the HWD affects co-workers' collaboration with supervisors, and (4) distraction depends on the point of view. Using activity theory, we discuss the fact that HWD use develops and changes over time and that even a single-user HWD influences the collaboration with co-workers.

We conducted a study about how people create their mental models from a dataset. Rather than presenting tabular data, we presented each participant with one of three datasets in paragraph form, to avoid biasing the data abstraction and mental model. We observed various mental models, data abstractions, and depictions from the same dataset, and how these concepts are influenced by communication and purpose-seeking. Our results have implications for visualization design, especially during the discovery and data collection phase.

 Implementing structure into our daily lives is critical for maintaining health, productivity, and social and emotional well-being. New norms for routine management have emerged during the current pandemic, and in particular, individuals with autism find it difficult to adapt to those norms. While much research has focused on the use of computer technology to support individuals with autism, little is known about ways of helping them establish and maintain “self-directed” routine structures. In this paper, we identify design requirements for an app that support four key routine components (i.e., physical activity, diet, mindfulness, and sleep) through a formative study and develop RoutineAid, a gamified smartphone app that reflects the design requirements. The results of a two-month field study on design feasibility highlight two affordances of RoutineAid—the establishment of daily routines by facilitating micro-planning and the maintenance of daily routines through celebratory interactions. We discuss salient design considerations for the future development of daily routine management tools for individuals with autism.

Drone operations such as power line inspection, automated deliveries, or crowd control are becoming more widespread.

These preparation tasks are complex and time-consuming but few previous works addressed them. We interviewed 14 professional drone operators, safety study consultants, and 2 regulators to better understand the needs for these tasks. The result is a workable model of the tasks which includes defining the concept of operation, assessing operational risks, and negotiating for authorization. We devised 9 recommendations to inform the design of future mission preparation tools, and consolidated them with a follow-up questionnaire. The recommendations include systematically describing a mission with operational parameters, showing their estimated impact on mission safety, or enabling awareness of the application’s status among all stakeholders. We conclude with design concerns and opportunities to inform future research.

Understanding tensions in music accessibility through song signing for and with d/Deaf and Non-d/Deaf persons,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581287,0,,"
 Song signing is a method practiced by people who are d/Deaf and non-d/Deaf individuals to visually represent music and make music accessible through sign language and body movements. Although there is growing interest in song signing, there is a lack of understanding on what d/Deaf people value about song signing and how to make song signing productions that they would consider acceptable.

We then interviewed 14 song signers to understand their experiences and processes in creating song signing performances. From this study, we identify three complex, interrelated layers of the song signing creation process and discuss how they can be supported and completed to potentially bridge the cultural divide between the d/Deaf and non-d/Deaf audiences and guide more culturally responsive creation of music.

Layout Generation for Various Scenarios in Mobile Shopping Applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581446,0,,"
 Layout is essential for the product listing pages (PLPs) in mobile shopping applications. To clearly convey the information that consumers require and to achieve specific functions, PLPs layouts often have many variations driven by scenarios. In this work, we study the PLPs layout design for different scenarios and propose a design space to guide the large-scale creation of PLPs. We propose LayoutVQ-VAE, a novel model specialized in generating layouts with internal and external constraints. LayoutVQ-VAE differs from previous methods as it learns a discrete latent representation of layout and can model the relationship between layout representation and scenarios without applying heuristics.

Designing Resource Allocation Tools to Promote Fair Allocation: Do Visualization and Information Framing Matter?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580739,0,https://inria.hal.science/hal-04074164/document,"
 Studies on human decision-making focused on humanitarian aid have found that cognitive biases can hinder the fair allocation of resources. However, few HCI and Information Visualization studies have explored ways to overcome those cognitive biases. This work investigates whether the design of interactive resource allocation tools can help to promote allocation fairness. We specifically study the effect of presentation format (using text or visualization) and a specific framing strategy (showing resources allocated to groups or individuals). In our three crowdsourced experiments, we provided different tool designs to split money between two fictional programs that benefit two distinct communities. Our main finding indicates that individual-framed visualizations and text may be able to curb unfair allocations caused by group-framed designs. This work opens new perspectives that can motivate research on how interactive tools and visualizations can be engineered to combat cognitive biases that lead to inequitable decisions.

Cognition-oriented Facilitation and Guidelines for Collaborative Problem-solving Online and Face-to-face: An in-depth examination of format and facilitation influence …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581112,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581112,"
During the Covid-19 pandemic, more guidelines were created to teach people how to facilitate meetings online, but few were designed from a cognition-oriented perspective. Additionally, solving complex problems is essential in many occupations. However, the influence of online and face-to-face discussion formats on the performance in complex problem-solving tasks is unclear, even though remote working has become common over the past several few years. Hence, this study aims to answer two research questions: (a) Does problem-solving performance differ between online and face-to-face meetings? and (b) Does facilitation improve problem-solving performance when different formats are used? We conducted experiments with 40 groups using a 2 × 2 factorial design, which were controlled for both facilitation and format. Each group comprised two randomly selected participants, and each problem-solving discussion lasted between 1.5–2 h. The obtained evidence showed that format can influence the performance of balancing intercorrelated factors in a complex scenario, but it does not affect the performance of achieving a predefined goal. Instead, it we found that facilitation is helpful for achieving a predefined goal. Based on the results obtained, we propose future design directions for problem-solving centric computer-supported cooperative work systems from a cognition-oriented perspective.

What is Sensitive About (Sensitive) Data? Characterizing Sensitivity and Intimacy with Google Assistant Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581164,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581164,"
 Digital technologies have increasingly integrated into people’s lives, continuously capturing their behavior through potentially sensitive data. In the context of voice assistants, there is a misalignment between experts, regulators, and users on whether and what data is ‘sensitive’, partly due to how data is presented to users; as single interactions. We investigate users’ perspectives on the sensitivity and intimacy of their Google Assistant speech records, introduced comprehensively as single interactions, patterns, and inferences. We collect speech records through data donation and explore them in collaboration with 17 users during interviews based on predefined data-sharing scenarios. Our results indicate a tipping point in perceived sensitivity and intimacy as participants delve deeper into their data and the information derived from it. We propose a conceptualization of sensitivity and intimacy that accounts for the fuzzy nature of data and must disentangle from it. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide recommendations.

"Accessibility Barriers, Conflicts, and Repairs: Understanding the Experience of Professionals with Disabilities in Hybrid Meetings",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581541,0,,"
 Workplaces around the globe are beginning to rapidly adopt hybrid meetings to conduct, plan, and organize their work. While previous literature explores the benefits and drawbacks of hybrid meetings, the experiences of professionals with disabilities are largely missing. With an orientation towards an accessible future of work, we interviewed 21 professionals with disabilities to unpack the accessibility barriers, opportunities, and conflicts of hybrid meetings. We highlight the creative ways professionals with disabilities developed workarounds and repairs to these accessibility tensions. Our paper expands the understanding of accessibility in hybrid meetings by identifying how the visibility of access labor may be affected by being in the room together with other colleagues or joining remotely. We also observed how hybrid configurations can require navigating accessibility conflicts specific to the location site of each participant. Building from our analysis, we offer practical suggestions and design directions to make hybrid meetings accessible.

Negotiating Experience and Communicating Information Through Abstract Metaphor,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580700,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580700,"
An implicit assumption in metaphor use is that it requires grounding in a familiar concept, prominently seen in the popular Desktop Metaphor. In human-to-human communication, however, abstract metaphors, without such grounding, are often used with great success. To understand when and why metaphors work, we present a case study of metaphor use in voice teaching. Voice educators must teach about subjective, sensory experiences and rely on abstract metaphor to express information about unseen and intangible processes inside the body. We present a thematic analysis of metaphor use by 12 voice teachers. We found that metaphor works not because of strong grounding in the familiar, but because of its ambiguity and flexibility, allowing shared understanding between individual lived experiences. We summarise our findings in a model of metaphor-based communication. This model can be used as an analysis tool within the existing taxonomies of metaphor in user interaction for better understanding why metaphor works in HCI. It can also be used as a design resource for thinking about metaphor use and abstracting metaphor strategies from both novel and existing designs.

A Case Study on Student Experiences of Social VR in a Remote STEM Classroom,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573852,1,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16_Hp-jfzGzRj-7oztVCUSYGilfwbemxo/view,"
 Extended reality (XR) technologies continue gaining traction in multiple higher education contexts. As XR becomes more commercially accessible to students and universities, its convenience for educational purposes presents a renewed potential for exploration. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, there is also a growing interest in cross-platform, socially orientated software for remote educational practices. However, the precise role of XR technologies and how they contribute to student experiences of remote learning, particularly the unique affordances of social virtual reality (VR) for evoking an embodied sense of presence, is relatively unknown. Based on real-world experiences, we present a case study on a social VR intervention in a remote higher education classroom to inspire Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers to investigate further the issues that arise from our practice-based research. Our motivations were to report, analyze, and summarize everyday virtual learning environment (VLE) challenges, identify design considerations for VLE technologies, and comment on social VR’s utility in delivering Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects in a remote setting. We apply a practical approach to investigate and identify potential HCI problems, capture the unique experiences of STEM students during the lockdown, and explore the effects of tutorial activities that give students agency in constructing VLEs. The findings of this student-focused case study draw attention to the design of social VR activities that support conventional, web browser-based VLEs.

 Since 2020, worldwide COVID-19-related lockdowns have led to a rapid increase of remote collaboration, particularly in the domain of knowledge work. This has undoubtedly brought challenges (e.g., work-life boundary management, social isolation), but also opportunities. Practices that have proven successful (e.g., through increased task performance, efficiency or satisfaction) are worth retaining in future. In this qualitative empirical study, we analyzed four teams’ (14 participants in total) mandatory remote collaboration over a period of several days to several months during a nationally imposed lockdown. We report results derived from questionnaires, logbooks, group interviews, and meeting recordings. We identify possible factors influencing quality of task outcome as well as subjective aspects like satisfaction, motivation, and team atmosphere. As a basis for our conclusions, we provide a scheme for categorizing effects of remote collaboration based on an exhaustive literature review on pandemic-induced mandatory remote work and collaboration.

 There is growing interest in how to enable in-service teachers to promote computational skills in their classes. Different researchers also highlight the importance of developing a critical mindset toward digital technology. This paper reports a case study, part of a training program for in-service teachers, organised by researchers and the local School District, to bring physical computing into class, and foster critical reflections on technology along the process. The program included teachers for diverse subjects, across primary and high schools. It used the novel IoTgo tool, adaptable to the needs of the different teachers. The study in this paper considers the case of an art class in a high school. According to the reported data analysis, the tool and the structure it offered enabled the teacher to bring computing into her art class, on her own, and learners to reflect along the process from different perspectives.

 The overlaying of physical spaces with digital information produces hybrid spaces, redefining people’s experience of social interactions. Location-based games (LBGs) with social components are a good case. Yet, the impact LBGs have on sociability remains under-researched. In April 2020, the new in-person/remote raiding format in the LBG Pokémon GO provided a lens to explore people’s social interactions in hybrid spaces. We interviewed 41 Pokémon GO players to understand how players coordinate and collaborate for in-person/remote raids and other social patterns. Our findings demonstrate that new social dynamics occurred: participants’ social interactions highly rely on external social media groups bridging cyberspace and the physical world. In such external social media groups, spontaneously formed leadership roles and mentor-mentee relationships demonstrate autonomy among players in the hybrid space. However, we observed that the interoperability issue challenges people’s experience. Overall, this work sheds light on the social interactions in LBGs as hybrid spaces.

 Fitts’ law is a behavioral model, used to design protocols and analyze data from pointing experiments. These are usually conducted in HCI to evaluate input performance. We recently proposed an alternative method to characterize input performance, called the method of PVPs in 1D, based on 1) a dual-minimization protocol, and 2) an analysis of the variability of entire trajectories. We extend the method in 2D; our contributions include new metrics, a new protocol, and a Python library. We also present the results of a controlled experiment where the new method is validated using three devices (mouse, touchpad, controller): effect sizes in the 2D case replicate those previously found. We also propose a comparison between Fitts’ law and our novel evaluation: the method of PVPs provides more information than Fitts’ law, and can predict its parameters. We discuss how this new method may relieve open problems of Fitts’ law.

 In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL policy according to users’ real-time performance could potentially solve this trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

We machine-knit the device and integrate small-scale actuators to envelop granular body locations such as fingers, catering to the shape of the hand. In addition, the device affords customizable compression levels through the enclosed fiber-like actuators. We characterize compression parameters and simulate the shunting of edema through a mock fluid system. Finally, we conduct a case study to evaluate the feasibility of the device, in which five hand edema patients assess KnitDema. Our study provides insights into the opportunities for robotic textiles to support personalized rehabilitation.

The launch of open governmental data portals (OGDPs) has popularized the open data movement of last decade. Although the amount of data in OGDPs is increasing, their functionalities are limited to finding datasets with titles/descriptions and downloading the actual files. This hinders the end users, especially those without technical skills, to find the open data tables and make use of them. We present Governor, an open-sourced[17] web application developed to make OGDPs more accessible to end users by facilitating searching actual records in the tables, previewing them directly without downloading, and suggesting joinable and unionable tables to users based on their latest working tables. Governor also manages the provenance of integrated tables allowing users and their collaborators to easily trace back to the original tables in OGDP. We evaluate Governor with a two-part user study and the results demonstrate its value and effectiveness in finding and integrating tables in OGDP.

Many of our activities rely on tactile feedback perceived through mechanoreceptors in our skin. While visual and auditory devices provide immersive experiences, cutaneous feedback devices are typically limited in the range of sensations they provide and are hence usually used and tested on relatively simple synthetic surfaces. We present a device designed in a human-centered process, triggering the mechanoreceptors sensitive to pressure, low-frequency vibrations, and high-frequency vibrations, enabling one to experience touch of complex real-world surfaces. The device is based on a parallel manipulator and a pin-array, that operate simultaneously at 200Hz and emulate coarse and fine geometrical features, respectively. The decomposition into coarse and fine features, alongside the high operation frequency, enable simulation of virtual surfaces. This was corroborated via experiments on complex real-world surfaces via both a quantitative recognition test and a usability questionnaire. We believe that this design can be incorporated in numerous applications.

One study examined the in-room experience using loudspeakers, comparing among spatialization algorithms spreading voices out horizontally. A second study compared varying degrees of horizontal separation of binaurally rendered voices for a remote participant using a headset. In-room participants preferred the widest spatialization over monophonic, stereo, and stereo-binary audio in metrics related to intelligibility and helpfulness. Remote participants preferred different widths of the audio stage depending on the number of voices. In both studies, rendering sound spatially increased performance in speech stream identification. Results indicate spatial audio benefits for in-room and remote attendees in video calls, although the in-room attendees accepted a wider audio stage than remote users.

 Automated recruitment tools are proliferating. While having the promise of improving efficiency, various risks, including bias, challenges the potential of these tools. An in-depth understanding of the perceived risk factors and needs from the perspective of both recruiters and job seekers is needed. We address this through an interview study in the high-tech industry to compare and contrast the concerns of these two roles. We found that the importance of clarifying position requirements and assessing candidates as “whole individuals” are commonly discussed by both recruiters and job seekers. In contrast, while recruiters tended to be more aware of cognitive bias and desired more tool support during interviews, job seekers voiced more desire towards a healthy candidate-company relationship. Additionally, both roles considered the uncertainty of the current technology capability and reduced human contact as concerns for using automated tools. Based on these results, we provided design implications for automated recruitment tools and related decision-support technologies.

 The emergent Optical Head-Mounted Display (OHMD) platform has made mobile reading possible by superimposing digital text onto users’ view of the environment. However, mobile reading through OHMD needs to be effectively balanced with the user’s environmental awareness. Hence, a series of studies were conducted to explore how text spacing strategies facilitate such balance. Through these studies, it was found that increasing spacing within the text can significantly enhance mobile reading on OHMDs in both simple and complex navigation scenarios and that such benefits mainly come from increasing the inter-line spacing, but not inter-word spacing. Compared with existing positioning strategies, increasing inter-line spacing improves mobile OHMD information reading in terms of reading speed (11.9% faster), walking speed (3.7% faster), and switching between reading and navigation (106.8% more accurate and 33% faster).

Drawing on a hand-crafted knowledge base, our method grounds generated content with in-game context while simultaneously employing a large-scale language model to create fluent, unique, accompanying dialogue. Through human evaluation, we confirm that quests generated using this method can approach the performance of hand-crafted quests in terms of fluency, coherence, novelty, and creativity; demonstrate the enhancement to the player experience provided by greater dynamism; and provide a novel, automated metric for the relevance between quest and dialogue. We view our contribution as a critical step toward dynamic, co-creative narrative frameworks in which humans and AI systems jointly collaborate to create unique and user-specific playable experiences.

By incorporating our observations along with the pathologists’ domain knowledge, we designed NaviPath — a human-AI collaborative navigation system. An evaluation study with 15 medical professionals in pathology indicated that: (i) compared to the manual navigation, participants saw more than twice the number of pathological patterns in unit time with NaviPath, and (ii) participants achieved higher precision and recall against the AI and the manual navigation on average. Further qualitative analysis revealed that navigation was more consistent with NaviPath, which can improve the overall examination quality.

 Anthropographics are human-shaped visualizations that aim to emphasize the human importance of datasets and the people behind them.

In response, we explore the creation of demographically diverse anthropographics that communicate the visible diversity of demographically distinct populations. Building on previous anthropographics research, we explore strategies for visualizing datasets about people in ways that explicitly encode diversity—illustrating these approaches with examples in a variety of visual styles. We also critically reflect on strategies for creating diverse anthropographics, identifying social and technical challenges that can result in harmful representations. Finally, we highlight a set of forward-looking research opportunities for advancing the design and understanding of diverse anthropographics.

A growing body of literature on mixed-ability teams within HCI investigates how disabled and non-disabled people collaborate. Still, how different disabilities can interact in a mixed-ability team is underexplored, especially for long commitments and in non-western contexts. As an emerging perspective in accessibility studies in HCI, disability justice emphasizes the importance of cross-disability collaborations. Collaborative access, interdependence, and cross-disability dialogue are keys to building accessible mixed-ability interactions. We conducted ten in-depth interviews with the members of a unique mixed-ability team (which includes people with different physical disabilities) using the same workspace with cross-disability interactions in Turkey. We aim to understand the requirements for an accessible mixed-ability virtual workspace and to identify practical design considerations for cross-disability solidarity-oriented virtual collaboration tools. To ensure equal access in virtual workspaces, we suggest implications for centering collective access, balancing external power dynamics, and supporting language and cultural diversities.

We describe how leveraging participatory methods, including asynchronous and remote engagements, enabled the co-creation of a sustainable digital common-pool resource, used by over 5,000 people worldwide. This study contributes novel configurations of methods and tools for co-design with ‘seldom heard’ populations. Demonstrating how these enabled the collective articulation of what constitutes trust, governance, and responsibility, in the design of a digital commons, “MyCareBudget”, offering peer-produced care documents for use by disabled citizens and their unpaid carers. We discuss implications for HCI interested in co-designing sustainable socio-technical interventions with underserved and marginalised populations, in healthcare settings.

"Electrical, Vibrational, and Cooling Stimuli-Based Redirected Walking: Comparison of Various Vestibular Stimulation-Based Redirected Walking Systems",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580862,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580862,"
 Redirected walking (RDW) is a technology that enables users to walk seamlessly in an enormous virtual space within a narrow real space while avoiding collisions with physical elements. Although RDW provides accurate proprioceptive sensations, redirection performance is limited by visual–vestibular inconsistencies. This study aims to support seamless walking in a VR environment by alleviating inconsistencies using four vestibular stimulations: noisy and directional galvanic vestibular stimulation, bone-conduction vibration, and caloric vestibular stimulation. The user study demonstrated that the stimulations successfully enable spatial expansion without impairing immersion and presence. Non-electrical stimulations (bone-conduction vibration and caloric vestibular stimulation) expanded the detection threshold, making them alternatives to electrical stimulations, and direction-based stimulation (directional galvanic vestibular stimulation) improved the user’s gait stability in RDW. Finally, the findings suggested improving the user experience for vestibular stimulation RDW either by lowering audio interference or increasing the synchronization between the RDW gain and the stimulation intensity.

DreamVR: Curating an Interactive Exhibition in Social VR Through an Autobiographical Design Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581362,0,,"
Virtual exhibitions have long been regarded as an extension of information delivery for physical exhibitions. However, what virtual exhibitions can offer audiences as a novel experience independently from physical exhibitions has been largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to understand the promises and challenges of experiencing and curating exhibitions in VR by interviewing nine expert curators. Drawing from expert insights, we summarized a set of design guidelines to inform what we can learn and adapt from physical exhibitions when curating in VR. Then, using an autobiographical design approach, we curated an interactive exhibition in VRChat to explore novel interaction techniques. We also hosted an open tour guide in the user study to validate our design guidelines with thirty participants. Results show that our approach of curating an exhibition in VRChat provided the participants with engaging and novel experiences interacting with the exhibits and other audiences.

"Grab It, While You Can: A VR Gesture Evaluation of a Co-Designed Traditional Narrative by Indigenous People",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580894,0,,"
 Recent developments in Virtual Reality (VR) applications, such as hand gesture tracking, provide new opportunities to create embodied user experiences. Numerous gesture elicitation studies have been conducted. However, in most instances they lack validation of implemented gestures, as well diversity of participant groups. Our research explores the digitalization of intangible cultural heritage in collaboration with one of the San tribes in Southern Africa. The focus is on particular gestures as embodied interactions of a VR implementation of a traditional San hunting story. In this paper, we present a gesture study, which entails an in-situ elicitation of natural gestures, a co-designed integration, a VR story implementation with grasping and three mid-air gestures, and a user evaluation. Based on our findings, we discuss the anthropological value of gesture implementations determined by an indigenous community, the local usability of a grasping gesture, and in-VR gesture elicitation, as an extension of existing methods.

Situating Automatic Speech Recognition Development within Communities of Under-heard Language Speakers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581385,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581385,"
 In this paper we develop approaches to automatic speech recognition (ASR) development that suit the needs and functions of under-heard language speakers. Our novel contribution to HCI is to show how community-engagement can surface key technical and social issues and opportunities for more effective speech-based systems. We introduce a bespoke toolkit of technologies and showcase how we utilised the toolkit to engage communities of under-heard language speakers; and, through that engagement process, situate key aspects of ASR development in community contexts. The toolkit consists of (1) an information appliance to facilitate spoken-data collection on topics of community interest, (2) a mobile app to create crowdsourced transcripts of collected data, and (3) demonstrator systems to showcase ASR capabilities and to feed back research results to community members. Drawing on the sensibilities we cultivated through this research, we present a series of challenges to the orthodoxy of state-of-the-art approaches to ASR development.

Using smart glasses to support situated decision making in aquaculture,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573856,2,,"
 The rapidly expanding prawn farming industry is vital in providing high-quality protein for the increasing global population. The key to consistently high yield is the efficient and effective management of pond water, maintaining the optimal growth environment. Our consultations with seven Australian commercial prawn farms found that the lack of access to essential real-time water information and trends has hindered farmers from making confident and timely decisions while in the field, which contributes considerably to either prolonged suboptimal pond conditions or increases in operational costs. This paper describes two aquaculture pond water management tasks that can benefit from wearable technology and discusses general concerns about using smart eyewear in harsh outdoor farming environments. A Pondside Visualisation System was created to allow farmers to access visualised historical and real-time water data during field operations using Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2. The application uses a new data visualisation style that is optimised for small near-eye displays. A validation study was conducted with seven industrial practitioners (including a supervisor and six farm technicians) on a commercial farm with real data from the recent growing season, where each technician made 100 pond management decisions using our system. Objective measurements of task completion time and task accuracy indicated the farmers achieved an accuracy of 86.4% and 89.2% for two management tasks with at least 41.0% less time compared to existing desktop-based practice. A structured expert review confirmed the usability of our system and discussed methods to mitigate issues discovered during the study. We also discussed lessons learned from the project.

Democratizing Making: Scaffolding Participation Using e-Waste to Engage Under-resourced Communities in Technology Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580759,2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10402,"
Maker culture and DIY practices are central to democratizing the design of technology; enabling non-designers (future end-users) to actively participate in the design process. However, little is known about how individuals from under-resourced communities and low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, can practically leverage maker practices to design technology, creating value for themselves or their communities. To investigate this, we collaborated with an e-waste recycling centre, involving 24 participants (staff and low-SES volunteers) in two participatory maker workshop activities. Participants were provided with a generative e-waste toolkit, through which they repurposed e-waste materials and developed novel technology prototypes that created value from their perspectives and agendas. Our findings unpack three factors that influenced their making: balancing personal and community needs; incorporating convenience and productivity; and re-thinking sustainability and connection; and discuss strategies for scaffolding participation and engagement of under-resourced communities in making using an e-waste generative toolkit to democratize technology design.

Creepy Assistant: Development and Validation of a Scale to Measure the Perceived Creepiness of Voice Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581346,0,https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~bryanw/assets/pdf/creepy-assistant-chi23.pdf,"
 Voice assistants have afforded users rich interaction opportunities to access information and issue commands in a variety of contexts. However, some users feel uneasy or creeped out by voice assistants, leading to a decreased desire to use them. As there has yet to be a comprehensive understanding of the factors that cause users to perceive voice assistants as being creepy, this research developed an empirical scale to measure the creepiness inherent in various voice assistants. Utilizing prior scale creation methodologies, a 7-item Perceived Creepiness of Voice Assistants Scale (PCAS) was created and validated. The scale measures how creepy a new voice assistant would be for users of voice assistants. The scale was developed to ensure that researchers and designers can evaluate the next generation of voice assistants before such voice assistants are released to the wider public.

Detecting fraud during online exams using proctoring software comes with substantial privacy challenges. Previous work argues students experience heightened anxiety and have privacy concerns. However, little is known about which specific aspects of online proctoring cause these concerns. This study contributes such insights by using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework to discover how students (N = 456) rate the acceptability of 1064 proctoring information flows with varying information types, recipients, and transmission principles. We find that the acceptability varies considerably depending on the context. Besides exposing obvious privacy violations, we find that, under certain conditions, students consider it acceptable to share data with teachers - despite their lack of involvement in proctoring. Also, the acceptability of sharing highly sensitive information - which should under no circumstances be shared - sometimes increases. We discuss the implications of these and other findings and provide concrete recommendations for educational institutions using online proctoring.

Play-to-Earn (P2E) crypto-games recently emerged as a gig opportunity despite the absence of regulations. As these platforms continue to grow, there is a need to understand the interactions involved to protect vulnerable stakeholders. This paper describes how an unintended social dynamic became a strategy guiding players to navigate an unregulated space. First, we inquired through surveys (N = 69) and interviews (N = 9) to understand stakeholder motivations and practices in this space. Second, we analyzed data and then conceptualized eight themes (e.g., Management, Social, Gaming). Then, we uncovered four types of relationships (e.g., Manager-Scholar, Manager-Investor-Scholar, Coach-Mentee, Scholar-Turned-Manager) that shaped the behaviours of the different users on the platform. Lastly, we present design implications and recommendations to guide the design of P2E crypto games and the gig-focused communities that thrive around them. Our results contribute to ongoing discussions in designing digital gig economies and crypto-based games.

Current research examining learning in makerspaces is primarily centered around the learners’ experiences and not the educators, thus presenting a gap not only in our understanding of educators’ perspectives but also in how we design educational technologies for learning in makerspaces. In our work, we address this gap through an interview study investigating seven educators’ experiences of teaching maker skills across five diverse makerspaces. Our thematic analysis of the educators’ practices resulted in an outline of the competencies that the educators centralize in their teaching, the strategies they integrate into their teaching practices, and the challenges they encounter while teaching in makerspaces. We discuss how this analysis can give insights into the educators’ values and perspectives of makerspace learning and inform the design of learning tools and experiences within the makerspaces.

 Educational software is rarely co-designed with teachers and students. We have created a novel co-design process that can help both teachers and students learn about human-computer interaction (HCI) and research methods while contributing to the design of educational systems that will benefit future students and teachers. We investigated the results of our process of mentoring two undergraduate students to lead participatory design (PD) sessions with three K-12 teachers. We found that this process exposed teachers and undergraduates to HCI research and design techniques, empowered undergraduates to lead design sessions, and encouraged knowledge transfer between the groups. Our lessons learned include ways to prepare students inexperienced with HCI to lead PD, with training in the participants’ domain, practice sessions, and predefined PD methods to adapt for their context. Our recommendations for future design collaborations can also provide insights to empower undergraduate students or less experienced teams and participants to benefit from participatory design efforts.

We introduce MechSense, 3D-printed rotary encoders that can be fabricated in one pass alongside rotational mechanisms, and report on their angular position, direction of rotation, and speed. MechSense encoders utilize capacitive sensing by integrating a floating capacitor into the rotating element and three capacitive sensor patches in the stationary part of the mechanism. Unlike existing rotary encoders, MechSense does not require manual assembly but can be seamlessly integrated during design and fabrication. Our MechSense editor allows users to integrate the encoder with a rotating mechanism and exports files for 3D-printing. We contribute a sensor topology and a computational model that can compensate for print deviations. Our technical evaluation shows that MechSense can detect the angular position (mean error: 1.4°) across multiple prints and rotations, different spacing between sensor patches, and different sizes of sensors. We demonstrate MechSense through three application examples on 3D-printed tools, tangible UIs, and gearboxes.

Multi-day music festivals have a waste problem with much of it centred around patron campgrounds. Interviews and co-design workshops were conducted with festival patrons (N = 19) and professionals (N = 9). The interviews indicated the factors impacting festival campground waste including the proliferation of cheap items, the continuity of management decisions, highly social camping practices, the land, and interactions between these. Co-design workshops explored these to produce sociotechnical strategies using the festival timeline as a frame, with one of these, a patron planning tool chosen for further development. This paper contributes new insights on how information and communication technologies might enhance sustainable practices by facilitating relational change through better organisation, evaluation, and feedback. It concludes with examination of the challenges and opportunities for Sustainable HCI, including how to carve out a design response to a wicked problem by situating relations, meaning making, telling invisible stories, and finding leverage points.

 Describing our interaction with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as ‘collaboration’ is well-intentioned, but flawed. Not only is it misleading, but it also takes away the credit of AI ‘labour’ from the humans behind it, and erases and obscures an often exploitative arrangement between AI producers and consumers. The AI ‘collaboration’ metaphor is merely the latest episode in a long history of labour appropriation and credit reassignment that disenfranchises labourers in the Global South. I propose that viewing AI as a tool or an instrument, rather than a collaborator, is more accurate, and ultimately fairer.

We investigate the design of public urban AI systems for contestability through the example of camera cars: human-driven vehicles equipped with image sensors. Applying a provisional framework for contestable AI, we use speculative design to create a concept video of a contestable camera car. Using this concept video, we then conduct semi-structured interviews with 17 civil servants who work with AI employed by a large northwestern European city. The resulting data is analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify the main challenges facing the implementation of contestability in public AI. We describe how civic participation faces issues of representation, public AI systems should integrate with existing democratic practices, and cities must expand capacities for responsible AI development and operation.

 Media coverage has historically played an influential and often stigmatizing role in the public’s understanding of mental illness through harmful language and inaccurate portrayals of those with mental health issues. However, it is unknown how and to what extent media events may affect stigma in online discourse regarding mental health. In this study, we examine a highly publicized event – the celebrity defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard – to uncover how stigmatizing and destigmatizing language on Twitter changed during and after the course of the trial. Using causal impact and language analysis methods, we provided a first look at how external events can lead to significantly greater levels of stigmatization and lower levels of destigmatization on Twitter towards not only particular disorders targeted in the coverage of external events but also general mental health discourse.

 Do patterns of eye-hand coordination observed during real-world object interactions apply to digital, screen-based object interactions?

We collected gaze (with webcam eye-tracking) and cursor position data from 51 fully-remote, crowd-sourced participants who performed the task on their own computer. We applied real-world time-series data segmentation strategies to resolve the self-paced movement sequence into phases of object interaction and rigorously cleaned the webcam eye-tracking data. In this preliminary investigation, we found that: 1) real-world eye-hand coordination patterns persist and adapt in this digital context, and 2) remote, online, cursor-tracking and webcam eye-tracking are useful tools for capturing visuomotor behaviours during this ecologically-valid human-computer interaction task. We discuss how these findings might inform design principles and further investigations into natural behaviours that persist in digital environments.

Interactive AR Applications for Nonspeaking Autistic People?-A Usability Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580721,0,,"
 About one-third of autistic people are nonspeaking, and most are never provided access to an effective alternative to speech. Thoughtfully designed AR applications could provide members of this population with structured learning opportunities, including training on skills that underlie alternative forms of communication. A fundamental step toward creating such opportunities, however, is to investigate nonspeaking autistic people’s ability to tolerate a head-mounted AR device and to interact with virtual objects. We present the first study to examine the usability of an interactive AR-based application by this population. We recruited 17 nonspeaking autistic subjects to play a HoloLens 2 game we developed that involved holographic animations and buttons. Almost all subjects tolerated the device long enough to begin the game, and most completed increasingly challenging tasks that involved pressing holographic buttons. Based on the results, we discuss best practice design and process recommendations. Our findings contradict prevailing assumptions about nonspeaking autistic people and thus open up exciting possibilities for AR-based solutions for this understudied and underserved population.

 Formal methods is a field that has a long standing history within Computer Science. At its core, it involves the use of mathematical formalisms to model and reason about computer systems and programs. The application of formal methods to verify that railway signalling systems operate safely and correctly is particularly well established within academia and is now beginning to see real applications in the railway sector. However, many contemporary approaches frequently detect false positive safety violations necessitating lengthy manual analysis by expert engineers. It has been shown that such errors can be mitigated with strengthening invariants, non-trivially generated properties which hold for all reachable states, or configurations, of a program under verification.  In this work, we report on the use of machine learning to explore such state spaces autonomously and provide various visual aids to assist engineers in understanding and inducing invariant properties to support verification. We conducted a focus group with an engineering team specialising in railway signalling systems, soliciting feedback on these visualisations while co-designing suggested improvements for the application domain. The results were two-fold; our visualisations allowed participants to explore candidate invariants, but also highlighted improvements to our machine learning approach by leveraging their domain knowledge.

The practice of interactive documentary can provide participatory opportunities thanks to its capacity for making space for audiences to leave their marks in a film. However, participants’ inclusion has often been limited to an a-posteriori contribution of materials rather than a structural involvement in the film design. What happens when we treat participants as authors and let them imagine and design their own interactive film? This paper explores how design processes from participatory filmmaking can be adapted to achieve this goal by presenting the design process that led to the production of an interactive participatory film on mental health, Stepping Through Interactive. Five participants with lived experience of mental health problems explored, designed, and produced a non-linear film form to effectively represent their personal accounts of mental health. We review the challenges faced and the strategies deployed in the design process in view of supporting similar forms of production in other contexts.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have many application areas including image editing, domain translation, missing data imputation, and support for creative work. However, GANs are considered ‘black boxes’. Specifically, the end-users have little control over how to improve editing directions through disentanglement. Prior work focused on new GAN architectures to disentangle editing directions. Alternatively, we propose GANravel—a user-driven direction disentanglement tool that complements the existing GAN architectures and allows users to improve editing directions iteratively. In two user studies with 16 participants each, GANravel users were able to disentangle directions and outperformed the state-of-the-art direction discovery baselines in disentanglement performance. In the second user study, GANravel was used in a creative task of creating dog memes and was able to create high-quality edited images and GIFs.

In Human-Computer-Interaction, vibrotactile haptic feedback offers the advantage of being independent of any visual perception of the environment. Most importantly, the user’s field of view is not obscured by user interface elements, and the visual sense is not unnecessarily strained. This is especially advantageous when the visual channel is already busy, or the visual sense is limited. We developed three design variants based on different vibrotactile illusions to communicate 3D directional cues. In particular, we explored two variants based on the vibrotactile illusion of the cutaneous rabbit and one based on apparent vibrotactile motion. To communicate gradient information, we combined these with pulse-based and intensity-based mapping. A subsequent study showed that the pulse-based variants based on the vibrotactile illusion of the cutaneous rabbit are suitable for communicating both directional and gradient characteristics. The results further show that a representation of 3D directions via vibrations can be effective and beneficial.

Collaborative Creativity in TikTok Music Duets,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581380,0,,"
 On the social media platform TikTok, users are able to engage with each other’s content by using the Duet feature, which allows them to re-share another user’s video while also layering on additional content to the original video. Through this, the affordances of the Duet feature facilitate a distributed and collaborative creative process, in which we can observe the evolution of cultural artifacts through the different versions that are produced from user contributions. As a result, the open-ended nature of these collaborations positions engagement as both a creative and social act. In this paper, we identify the ways in which the Duet feature supports decentralized co-creativity and engagement between users. We find that the cumulative nature of an artifact’s creative evolution, along with the ability for multiple iterations of an artifact to develop in parallel, facilitates development of diverse creative artifacts.

The concept of phubbing (generally defined as a practice of ignoring co-present others by focusing on one's mobile device) is now widely used in studies aiming to understand the effects of smartphone use on co-present interactions. However, most of these studies are quantitative in nature and fail to grasp the interactional context of smartphone use. Drawing on video recordings and utilizing multimodal interaction analysis, the present study examines phubbing in naturally occurring interactions among young adults. Contrary to most previous research, the analysis reveals that disengagement often precedes self-initiated smartphone use rather than follows it. The study identifies factors that affect whether phubbing is reciprocated and whether it is oriented to as problematic. As a result of the analysis, an alternative conceptualization of phubbing is offered. By reflecting on participants’ ways of managing phubbing and its consequences, we discuss design solutions for supporting them in this task.

 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, visualizations became commonplace in public communications to help people make sense of the world and the reasons behind government-imposed restrictions. Though the adult population were the main target of these messages, children were affected by restrictions through not being able to see friends and virtual schooling. However, through these daily models and visualizations, the pandemic response provided a way for children to understand what data scientists really do and provided new routes for engagement with STEM subjects. In this paper, we describe the development of an interactive and accessible visualization tool to be used in workshops for children to explain computational modeling of diseases, in particular COVID-19. We detail our design decisions based on approaches evidenced to be effective and engaging such as unplugged activities and interactivity. We share reflections and learnings from delivering these workshops to 140 children and assess their effectiveness.

Towards a Preliminary Ontology of Dark Patterns Knowledge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585676,1,https://colingray.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023_GraySantosBielova_CHIBLW_OntologyDarkPatterns.pdf,"
 Deceptive design practices are increasingly used by companies to extract profit, harvest data, and limit consumer choice. Dark patterns represent the most common contemporary amalgamation of these problematic practices, connecting designers, technologists, scholars, regulators, and legal professionals in transdisciplinary dialogue. However, a lack of universally accepted definitions across the academic, legislative and regulatory space has likely limited the impact that scholarship on dark patterns might have in supporting sanctions and evolved design practices. In this late breaking work, we seek to harmonize regulatory and academic taxonomies of dark patterns, proposing a preliminary three-level ontology to create a shared language that supports translational research and regulatory action. We identify potential directions for scholarship and social impact building upon this ontology.

Towards a Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence Maturity Model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585752,1,,"
Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a central building block of computational systems. Following the long traditions of human-centered design, Human-Centered AI (HCAI) emphasises the importance of putting humans and various societal considerations in the centre of the development. However, the question is: how to realise HCAI when designing systems that utilise novel computational tools and require consideration of increasingly broad set of requirements, spanning from fairness and transparency to accountability and ethics? The purpose of our study is to support the AI development practices in companies in order for the humans to have AI solutions that are efficient, trustworthy, and safe. To this end, we propose a maturity model for HCAI (HCAI-MM). In this paper we present the first phase of the model development, in which the central building blocks of HCAI are specified and initial company requirements for the model's structure and content are evaluated with four AI developers.

Performative Vocal Synthesis for Foreign Language Intonation Practice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581210,0,https://hal.science/hal-04113924/document,"
 Typical foreign language (L2) pronunciation training focuses mainly on individual sounds. Intonation, the patterns of pitch change across words or phrases is often neglected, despite its key role in word-level intelligibility and in the expression of attitudes and affect. This paper examines hand-controlled real-time vocal synthesis, known as Performative Vocal Synthesis (PVS), as an interaction technique for practicing L2 intonation in computer aided pronunciation training (CAPT).  We evaluate a tablet-based interface where users gesturally control the pitch of a pre-recorded utterance by drawing curves on the touchscreen. 24 subjects (12 French learners, 12 British controls) imitated English phrases with their voice and the interface. Results of an acoustic analysis and expert perceptive evaluation showed that learners’ gestural imitations yielded more accurate results than vocal imitations of the fall-rise intonation pattern typically difficult for francophones, suggesting that PVS can help learners produce intonation patterns beyond the capabilities of their natural voice.

Using Logs Data to Identify When Software Engineers Experience Flow or Focused Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581562,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581562,"
 Beyond self-report data, we lack reliable and non-intrusive methods for identifying flow. However, taking a step back and acknowledging that flow occurs during periods of focus gives us the opportunity to make progress towards measuring flow by isolating focused work. Here, we take a mixed-methods approach to design a logs-based metric that leverages machine learning and a comprehensive collection of logs data to identify periods of related actions (indicating focus), and validate this metric against self-reported time in focus or flow using diary data and quarterly survey data. Our results indicate that we can determine when software engineers at a large technology company experience focused work which includes instances of flow. This metric speaks to engineering work, but can be leveraged in other domains to non-disruptively measure when people experience focus. Future research can build upon this work to identify signals associated with other facets of flow.

Toward a Multilingual Conversational Agent: Challenges and Expectations of Code-mixing Multilingual Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581445,0,,"
 Multilingual speakers tend to interleave two or more languages when communicating. This communication strategy is called code-mixing, and it has surged with today’s ever-increasing linguistic and cultural diversity. Because of their communication style, multilinguals who use conversational agents have specific needs and expectations which are currently not being met by conversational systems. While research has been undertaken on code-mixing conversational systems, previous works have rarely focused on the code-mixing users themselves to discover their genuine needs. This work furthers our understanding of the challenges faced by code-mixing users in conversational agent interaction, unveils the key factors that users consider in code-mixing scenarios, and explores expectations that users have for future conversational agents capable of code-mixing. This study discusses the design implications of our findings and provides a guide on how to alleviate the challenges faced by multilingual users and how to improve the conversational agent user experience for multilingual users.

A Usability Evaluation of AFL and libFuzzer with CS Students,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581178,0,,"
In top-tier companies and academia, fuzzing has established itself as a valuable tool for finding bugs. It is a tool created by experts for experts, and a lot of research is being invested into improving the power of fuzzing. However, the usability of fuzzing has not received much attention yet. To alleviate this, we evaluated the usability of two popular fuzzers: AFL and libFuzzer. In our fuzzing study, 47 computer science students each worked up to 20 hours in total. We found significant usability challenges for both fuzzers leading to only 17 participants who were able to finish all tasks. Even the successful participants struggled with some of the necessary steps and found them complex and confusing. While on the whole, AFL fared better than libFuzzer, both fuzzers have strengths and weaknesses and can be improved based on our results.

However, creation of a Metaverse or “new world” presents the opportunity to create one which is inclusive and accessible to all. This challenge is explored and discussed in this workshop, with an aim of understanding how to create a Metaverse which is open and inclusive to people with physical and intellectual disabilities, and how interactions can be designed in a way to minimise disadvantage. The key outcomes of this workshop outline new opportunities for improving accessibility in the Metaverse, methodologies for designing and evaluating accessibility, and key considerations for designing accessible Metaverse environments and interactions.

Magical Brush: A Symbol-Based Modern Chinese Painting System for Novices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581429,0,,"
 Modern Chinese painting is a new type of painting inherited from ancient Chinese painting. Drawing modern Chinese painting is time-consuming and laborious, which is difficult for novices to start. Symbols are fundamental components of Chinese cultural works both materially and mentally. We introduce a symbol-based modern Chinese painting system termed Magical Brush. Magical Brush combines symbolic cultural factors with AI generative models, with the attempt to help novices create a complete modern Chinese painting, learn basic ideas of Chinese paintings and obtain co-creation engagement. In user study, we compare Magical Brush to other AI and non-AI digital painting tools. Results indicate that by combining cultural factors, Magical Brush can help novices easily create modern Chinese paintings and experience the cultural connotations in the process.

 Structured editing can show benefits in learnability, tool building, and editing efficiency in programming. However, creating a usable structured editor is laborious and demanding, typically requiring tool builders to manually create or adjust editing interactions.  We present Sandblocks, a system that allows users to automatically generate structured editors for every language with a formal grammar available. Our system’s input reconciliation process acts on arbitrary syntax trees to provides consistent interactions across our generated editors. Our editors’ editing experience is designed to be familiar to users from textual editing but, compared to previous work, requires no manual annotation in the grammars.  We demonstrate our editors’ usability across languages through a user study (N=18). Compared to conventional text editors, even with minimal training, participants only took on average 21% (JS), 34% (Clojure), and 95% (RegExp) longer and reported that editing felt natural with a score of 6/7.

Let warnings interrupt the interaction and explain: designing and evaluating phishing email warnings,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585802,1,,"
 Phishing represents one of the most spread and effective cyber-attacks of our times. Warning messages are commonly employed in email clients to notify users about the possible danger and let them decide on their own. However, the high success rate of phishing attacks shows that the existing warnings are not yet adequate. This study contributes by proposing two novel warning dialogs for email clients that prevent users from immediately accessing the content of phishing emails. Specifically, the first one alerts the users against the potential scam, and the second one also reports explanations about the possible causes of the scam. A comparative between-subjects experiment with 300 participants has been performed. Results show that the proposed warnings better defend users from phishing emails than the warnings at the state-of-the-art. In addition, explanations resulted useful in preventing users from discarding genuine emails where warnings are displayed incorrectly due to misclassification of the email.

 In the active field of hand microgestures, microgesture descriptions are typically expressed informally and are accompanied by images, leading to ambiguities and contradictions. An important step in moving the field forward is a rigorous basis for precisely describing, comparing, and analyzing microgestures. Towards this goal, we propose µGlyph, a hybrid notation based on a vocabulary of events inspired by finger biomechanics. First, we investigate the expressiveness of µGlyph by building a database of 118 microgestures extracted from the literature. Second, we experimentally explore the usability of µGlyph. Participants correctly read and wrote µGlyph descriptions 90% of the time, as compared to 46% for conventional descriptions. Third we present tools that promote µGlyph usage, including a visual editor with LaTeX export. We finally describe how µGlyph can guide research on designing, developing, and evaluating microgesture interaction. Results demonstrate the strong potential of µGlyph to establish a common ground for microgesture research.

Becoming a Speleologist: Design Implications for Coordination in Wild Outdoor Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581545,0,,"
Learning outdoor sports entails acquiring physical skills, managing gear, and coordinating with others. We investigated how speleologists are trained to explore underground caves. We interviewed 15 instructors and 10 trainees to understand the main problems that may occur during training cave trips. Our findings show that stressful situations are linked to beginners’ difficulties applying new gestures and procedures - on which their progression and safety depend - and coordinating with others when they are out of sight. It emerged that group awareness and communication are pivotal for their tranquility. Yet, the underground environment makes communicating very hard. This study led to the elaboration of design implications for technology supporting awareness, communication, and coordination in speleology training, which draw from and enrich previous literature on coordination in the wild, as it may happen while performing outdoor sports or during search-and-rescue operations.

 Traces of touch provide valuable insight into how we interact with the physical world. Measuring touch behavior, however, is expensive and imprecise. Utilizing a fluorescent UV tracer powder, we developed a low-cost analog method to capture persistent, high-contrast touch records on arbitrary objects. We describe our process for selecting a tracer, methods for capturing, enhancing, and aggregating traces, and approaches to examining qualitative aspects of the user experience. Three user studies demonstrate key features of this method. First, we show that it provides clear and durable traces on objects representative of scientific visualization, physicalization, and product design. Second, we demonstrate how this method could be used to study touch perception, by measuring how task and narrative framing elicit different touch behaviors on the same object. Third, we demonstrate how this method can be used to evaluate data physicalizations by observing how participants touch two different physicalizations of COVID-19 time-series data.

Special interest group on creativity and cultures in computing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3583175,1,,"
Research on creativity support tools (CSTs) has a long history in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); however, researchers often focus on developing novel CSTs and verifying them in a controlled lab setting, rather than on capturing the creative process in the wild. In reality, creative activity is exploratory, laborious, and involves multiple CSTs; which together form a creativity support environment or ecology. Creative activity is also social, cultural, and collaborative with people distributing, modifying, and reacting to the creations of others. This process can inspire subsequent iterations. To understand and support open-ended, culturally embedded, collaborative creativity, HCI researchers are seeking new methods to study the sociocultural aspects of creativity support. This Special Interest Group on Creativity and Cultures in Computing (SIGCCC) invites diverse researchers to provide a forum for CST discussions from a wide sociocultural lens. The participants will identify and discuss the state-of-the-art and conceptualize future directions for creativity support research.

 Getting from A to B has never been easier. Mobile navigation systems allow universal access to spatial information. However, following detailed route instructions leads to a decrease in spatial exploration behaviour and therefore a reduction of spatial knowledge acquisition. Facilitating spatial exploration has the potential to counteract this negative effect. This paper investigates how we can support people in re-discovering their surroundings. We designed and evaluated a mobile application to promote spatial exploration through gamification. The app requires active exploration behaviour to uncover a map. Gamification elements such as quests, statistics, and social competition are used to encourage exploration. We conducted an exploratory field study (n = 22). Our results show a significant increase in familiarity with the environment and a variety of exploration patterns. Based on our findings, we propose modifications to current mapping applications by limiting the visible cartographic elements and alternating routes to improve spatial knowledge acquisition.

Games can be powerful vehicles for gender identity exploration and self-reflection but are often subject to designers' biases including gender representation, limiting such opportunities. Using a game jam as a research-through-design method, alongside qualitative interviews with the creators, this paper explores how the process of creating games and the games themselves can facilitate exploration of and reflection on gender identity. We highlight aspects of identity people want to explore; how different game elements can support processes of exploring these, and what aspects are missing in games. Further, the process of creating and playing helped participants reflect on and reframe their understanding of gender regardless of their identity/experience. Finally, we reflect on the process of designing an inclusive jam around the topic of gender identity, which can be sensitive and divisive. Our work results in implications for the design of games and other potential tools for gender exploration.

 Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, videoconferencing technology has been widely adopted as a convenient, powerful, and fundamental tool that has simplified many day-to-day tasks. However, video communication is dependent on audible conversation and can be strenuous for those who are Hard of Hearing. Communication methods used by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community differ significantly from those used by the hearing community, and a distinct language gap is evident in workspaces that accommodate workers from both groups. Therefore, we integrated users in both groups to explore ways to alleviate obstacles in mixed-group videoconferencing by implementing user-generated icons. A participatory design methodology was employed to investigate how the users overcome language differences. We observed that individuals utilized icons within video-mediated meetings as a universal language to reinforce comprehension. Herein, we present design implications from these findings, along with recommendations for future icon systems to enhance and support mixed-group conversations.

Foldable touch screens are increasingly popular, but little research has explored how the hinge impacts usability and performance. We evaluate across- and along-hinge drag gestures on a series of prototypes emulating foldable all-screen laptops with a curved hinge radius ranging from 1mm to 24mm. Results show that using a large 24mm hinge radius instead of a small 1mm hinge radius can decrease drag time by 13% and movement variability by 7% for touch input. However, hinge radius had no effect on performance for pen input. Further, we found that dragging along the hinge was up to 30% faster than dragging across the hinge, especially when dragging across at an acute angle to the hinge. Using these results, we demonstrate use cases for across- and along-hinge gestures. Our findings provide guidance for hardware and interaction designers seeking to create foldable touchscreen devices and their accompanying software.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted many business activities to non-face-to-face activities, and videoconferencing has become a new paradigm. However, conference spaces isolated from surrounding interferences are not always readily available. People frequently participate in public places with unexpected crowds or acquaintances, such as cafés, living rooms, and shared offices. These environments have surrounding limitations that potentially cause challenges in speaking up during videoconferencing. To alleviate these issues and support the users in speaking-restrained spatial contexts, we propose a text-to-speech (TTS) speaking tool as a new speaking method to support active videoconferencing participation. We derived the possibility of a TTS speaking tool and investigated the empirical challenges and user expectations of a TTS speaking tool using a technology probe and participatory design methodology. Based on our findings, we discuss the need for a TTS speaking tool and suggest design considerations for its application in videoconferencing.

 Collaborative writing is prevalent, yet is rife with issues of discomfort and miscommunication among others despite access to limitless text. Editing, one key activity in collaborative writing, is prone to such issues, and providing rationales could be a promising solution. To understand the efficacy of rationales in this context, we conducted an online experiment pairing 40 participants to co-write two essays on Google Docs—one without rationales (control) and another with rationales (treatment)—followed by post-experiment surveys (N=40) and interviews (N=11) with participants who received edits with and without rationales. Despite no significant differences between conditions in survey results, interviews revealed that most people preferred collaborating with those who provided rationales and perceived them more favorably. All interviewees deemed rationales important in collaborative writing and felt the pros outweighed the cons.

Query Execution Plans and Semantic Errors: Usability and Educational Opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585794,2,,"
 Syntax errors are typically separated from semantic errors in query formulation, the former being detected by the database management system (DBMS), and the latter seemingly not. On the other hand, query execution plans are typically utilized in query optimization, and not interconnected with syntax errors, as a syntactically invalid query produces no execution plan. In this study, we show and argue for breaking the confound between execution plans and error messages for better query formulation usability and education. We show how several popular DBMSs detect semantic errors and complications in queries, yet often do not inform the user of such problems. This study is a demonstration of how decades old technology could be used more effectively in novel contexts of usability and software engineering education with little effort by showing query writers not merely syntax errors, but also semantic errors and complications detected by DBMSs.

Twenty interviews were conducted with musicians who have used no-input mixing desk in their practice. Thematic analysis is used to explore the interview data. Results highlight the enjoyment and creative fulfilment of working with systems that can’t be fully predicted or understood, a sense of gestural immediacy, sensitivity and tactility often perceived as lacking in digital instruments, and an affinity with acoustic instruments in terms of the scope for surprise and exploration.

 Intelligent systems are increasingly interacting with people, both in their daily lives and through their use in safety critical systems. Current research is focused on how to use intelligent systems in a collaborative way as a teammate, rather than a tool. This requires a better understanding of what behaviors enable effective human-agent teams. This paper reports an experiment where a human player collaborates with an agent to perform a maneuvering task while concurrently performing a memory task. The player must determine in which contexts the agent requires their input to achieve better combined game plus memory task accuracy scores. We hypothesized that high-performing teams would exhibit different patterns of control inputs when compared to low-performing teams and that these patterns of control would be made more evident with user interfaces that increased operator situation awareness. Preliminary results are inconclusive, but show different patterns of interaction between high- and low-performing teams.

 Accessing online support services can be dangerous for some users, such as domestic abuse survivors. Many support service websites contain “quick exit” buttons that provide an easy way for users to escape the site. We investigate where exit buttons and other escape mechanisms are currently in use (country and type of site) and how they are implemented. We analyse both the security and usability of exit mechanisms on 323 mobile and 404 desktop sites. We find exit buttons typically replace the current page with another site, occasionally opening additional tabs. Some exit buttons also remove the page from the browser history. When analysing the design choices and shortcomings of exit button implementations, common problems include cookie notices covering the buttons, and buttons not remaining on the screen when scrolling. We provide recommendations for designers of support websites who want to add or improve this feature on their website.

Machine Learning models have become more advanced than could have been supposed even a few years ago, often surpassing human performance on many tasks. Large language models (LLM) can produce text indistinguishable from human-produced text. This begs the question, how necessary are humans - even for tasks where humans appear indispensable?  Qualitative Analysis (QA) is integral to human-computer interaction research, requiring both human-produced data and human analysis of that data to illuminate human opinions about and experiences with technology. We use GPT-3 and ChatGPT to replace human analysis and then to dispense with human-produced text altogether. We find GPT-3 is capable of automatically identifying themes and generating nuanced analyses of qualitative data arguably similar to those written by human researchers. We also briefly ponder philosophical implications of this research.

These services often disseminate tailored health information and provide channels for families to ask questions to health workers. With increasing uptake, these services are intervening into a highly gendered space and shaping care work and information-seeking in new ways. We present a study of a patient education program and associated WhatsApp-based information service deployed across multiple states in India, drawing on observations, interviews, and analysis of chat records. Building on notions of “unsettling care” [63], we examine what it means to deploy such an intervention in inequitable, fragmented health systems. We find that even as the intervention focuses on individual behavior change, it also runs up against structural issues, such as the overburden of health workers, an illegible health system, and gendered power dynamics that extend beyond the realm of the home. We use our findings to unsettle notions of how the intervention provides care, and to reframe how we might think about the design and implementation of health information services to also engage with structural issues.

Exploring User Motivations Behind iOS App Tracking Transparency Decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580654,0,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lZVa22-1NPGa5ibaU5jB9WcV2PckyGTW/view,"
 Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework allows users to decide whether they want to allow their activity to be tracked for advertising purposes. In this work we examine the tracking decisions made by 312 participants and their associations with privacy concern and personality factors, and conduct a thematic analysis on participants’ reasons for choosing to accept or reject tracking requests. Despite 51% of participants reporting that they had rejected tracking for privacy reasons, higher privacy concern scores did not correlate with a lower rate of tracking acceptance. Additionally, 43% of participants held incorrect beliefs about what tracking does, including nearly a quarter who mistakenly believed that accepting a tracking request would share their location with the requesting app. We suggest explanations for these misconceptions and provide recommendations that may improve usability of both App Tracking Transparency and future Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

The spatial performance assessment for cognitive evaluation (space): A novel game for the early detection of cognitive impairment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3583828,1,,"
 Dementia is a leading cause of dependency and death among older adults and an economic burden to healthcare. In the fast-paced non-gaming environment of healthcare, the detection of dementia is limited to invasive and expensive procedures (e.g., PET) or less sensitive paper and pencil tests. Typically, dementia is preceded by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) which is characterised by the loss of cognitive function including deficits in spatial ability. Spatial ability may be a sensitive marker for discriminating between healthy individuals and MCI patients. Virtual Reality now allows for spatial tests to be easily and safely deployed in clinics or at home. We introduce the Spatial Performance Assessment for Cognitive Evaluation (SPACE) as a transgressive, transformative gamified battery of spatial tests for tablets. SPACE is designed to identify differences in spatial ability to support clinicians in the early detection of dementia and offers a flexible ecosystem for immediate and longitudinal assessments.

TurnAhead: Designing 3-DoF Rotational Haptic Cues to Improve First-person Viewing (FPV) Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581443,0,,"
First-Person View (FPV) drone is a recently developed category of drones designed for precision flying and for capturing exhilarating experiences that could not be captured before, such as navigating through tight indoor spaces and flying extremely close to subjects of interest. FPV viewing experiences, while exhilarating, typically have frequent rotations that can lead to visually induced discomfort. We present TurnAhead, which uses 3-DoF rotational haptic cues that correspond to camera rotations to improve the comfort, immersion, and enjoyment of FPV experiences. It uses headset-mounted air jets to provide ungrounded rotational forces and is the first device to support rotation around all 3 axes: yaw, pitch, and roll. We conducted a series of perception and formative studies to explore the design space of timing and intensity of haptic cues, followed by user experience evaluation, for a combined total of 44 participants (n=12, 8, 6, 18). Results showed that TurnAhead significantly improved overall comfort, immersion, and enjoyment, and was preferred by 89% of participants.

SpeakFaster Observer: Long-Term Instrumentation of Eye-Gaze Typing for Measuring AAC Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573870,1,https://research.google/pubs/pub52025.pdf,"
 Accelerating communication for users with severe motor and speech impairments, in particular for eye-gaze-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device users, is a longstanding area of research. However, observation of such users’ communication over extended durations has been limited. This case study presents the real-world experience of developing and field-testing a tool for observing and curating the gaze typing-based communication of an eye-gaze AAC user with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With the intent to observe and develop technology to accelerate eye-gaze typed communication, we designed a tool and a protocol called the SpeakFaster Observer to measure everyday conversational text entry by the gaze-typing user, as well as several consenting conversation partners of the AAC user. We detail the design of the Observer software and data curation protocol, along with considerations for privacy protection. The deployment of the data protocol from November 2021 to April 2022 yielded a rich dataset of gaze-based AAC text entry from everyday life, consisting of 130+ hours of gaze keystrokes and 5,000+ curated speech utterances from the AAC user and the conversation partners. We present the key statistics of the data, including the speed (8.1 ± 3.9 words per minute) and keystroke saving rate (-0.14 ± 0.83) of gaze typing, patterns of utterance repetition and reuse, and the temporal dynamics of conversation turn-taking in gaze-based communication. We share our findings and also open source our data collection tools to further research in this domain.

Designing Participatory AI: Creative Professionals' Worries and Expectations about Generative AI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585657,1,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08931,"
 Generative AI, i.e., the group of technologies that automatically generate visual or written content based on text prompts, has undergone a leap in complexity and become widely available within just a few years. Such technologies potentially introduce a massive disruption to creative fields. This paper presents the results of a qualitative survey (N = 23) investigating how creative professionals think about generative AI. The results show that the advancement of these AI models prompts important reflections on what defines creativity and how creatives imagine using AI to support their workflows. Based on these reflections, we discuss how we might design participatory AI in the domain of creative expertise with the goal of empowering creative professionals in their present and future coexistence with AI.

 Machine learning is applied in a multitude of sectors with very impressive results. This success is due to the availability of an ever-growing amount of data acquired by omnipresent sensor devices and platforms on the internet. But there is a scarcity of labeled data which is required for most ML methods. However, generation of labeled data requires much time and resources. In this paper, we propose a portable, Open Source, simple and responsive manual Tool for 2D multiple object Tracking Annotation (TmoTA). Besides responsiveness, our tool design provides several features like view centering and looped playback that speed up the annotation process. We evaluate our proposed tool by comparing TmoTA with the widely used manual labeling tools CVAT, Label Studio, and two semi-automated tools Supervisely and VATIC with respect to object labeling time and accuracy. The evaluation includes a user study and pre-case studies showing that the annotation time per object frame can be reduced by 20% to 40% over the first 20 annotated objects compared to the manual labeling tools.

Digital Skills for the Creative Practitioner: Supporting Informal Learning of Technologies for Creativity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573825,1,,"
The creative industries play an important role in economic, cultural and social life, and in many creative disciplines much of the workforce is made up of individual practitioners including freelancers, sole traders and small or micro enterprises. These talented creatives often need to be responsible for their own ongoing learning within challenging and ever-evolving digital and technological domains. Whether their creative practice is primarily analogue or digital, Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) and digital platforms are being adopted for use in many phases of the creative production and dissemination process. By necessity, much of the learning that creatives undertake during the adoption of technologies is self-directed, informal, and often involves peer-to-peer support. This is an important contextual factor that HCI research needs to address when developing tools and support systems for this user group. This one-day workshop will bring together participants from the HCI, creative and educational communities to discuss and share knowledge of technology learning and skills acquisition for working creatives. The workshop aims to examine ideas, strategies and experiences around supporting digital literacy, competency and confidence. The goal is to develop further collaborative research addressing support structures and frameworks in the area of informal learning about digital creativity tools for working practitioners.

 Evaluation of exoskeleton performance benefits from standards to verify proper functionality and safety. Currently, there are limited evaluation methods for exoskeletons. Measurement methods to evaluate human-exoskeleton kinematics include optical tracking systems (OTS) and inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, OTS and IMUs can be intrusive, requiring the attachment of markers or sensors. This research focuses on investigating markerless 3D pose estimation algorithms with low-cost red, green, blue (RGB) cameras to determine their viability as methods for tracking human joint positions and deriving skeletal frame orientations. We present a tool that utilizes state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation algorithms to generate 3D pose estimation data. Future experiments will be performed to evaluate the viability of 3D pose estimation algorithms as markerless methods for joint position and orientation estimation.

 Recent regulatory changes have enabled NCAA student-athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL), departing from previous policies requiring those athletes to maintain their amateur status. However, despite the changes, it is unlikely that all the approximately 500,000 NCAA student-athletes will profit from NIL contracts. Within this context, we study how to design a fair and inclusive solution that may help all student-athletes secure NIL financial resources. Following a design science approach, we define design requirements after interviewing student-athletes. Subsequently, we derive three design principles: inclusiveness, fairness, and transparency. Thereafter, we suggest a blockchain-based artifact that satisfies all design principles. Our idea lies in designing collectibles as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that pay different royalties whenever a transaction (purchase or exchange) happens in different markets (primary or secondary). Finally, we evaluate our solution by discussing its features with current student-athletes.

OCOsense Glasses–Monitoring Facial Gestures and Expressions for Augmented Human-Computer Interaction: OCOsense Glasses for Monitoring Facial Gestures …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3583918,1,,"
The paper presents the OCOsenseTM smart glasses system, which recognizes and monitors facial gestures and expressions by using non-contact optomyographic OCOTM sensors and an IMU placed inside the frames of the glasses. The glasses stream the sensor data via Bluetooth to a mobile device, where data-fusion algorithms are applied, to recognize facial gestures and expressions in real time. The recognized gestures and expressions are then used as input to interact with the mobile device. We will demonstrate how the system is used in practice, i.e., a participant will wear the OCOsenseTM glasses and will interact with the mobile device by doing facial gestures and expressions. Three use cases will be presented: video control, call control, and game control. We believe that the OCOsenseTM glasses are the next generation in wearables, which will allow for a better understanding of the user's context and emotional state, and will allow numerous ways to interact with smart devices and computer systems, even within Augmented and Extended Reality environments. Future versions of the system can be used in a variety of domains, including, affective computing, remote mental-health monitoring, and hands-free human-computer interaction, thus improving accessibility and inclusivity of future technologies.

How bold can we be? The impact of adjusting font grade on readability in light and dark polarities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3581552,1,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581552,"
 Variable font file technology enables adjusting fonts on scaled axes that can include weight, and grade. While making text bold increases the character width, grade achieves boldness without increasing character width or causing text reflow. Through two studies with a total of 459 participants, we examined the effect of varying grade levels on both glancing and paragraph reading tasks in light and dark modes. We show that dark text on a light background (Light Mode) is read reliably faster than its polar opposite (Dark Mode). We found an effect of mode for both glance and paragraph reading and an effect of grade for LM with heavier, increased grade levels. Paragraph readers are not choosing, or preferring, LM over DM despite fluency benefits and reported visual clarity. Software designers can vary grade across the tested font formats to influence design aesthetics and user preferences without worrying about reducing reading fluency.

The Japanese notion of “kawaii” or expressions of cuteness, vulnerability, and/or charm is a global cultural export. Work has explored kawaii-ness as a design feature and factor of user experience in the visual appearance, nonverbal behaviour, and sound of robots and virtual characters. In this initial work, we consider whether voices can be kawaii by exploring the vocal qualities of voice assistant speech, i.e., kawaii vocalics. Drawing from an age-inclusive model of kawaii, we ran a user perceptions study on the kawaii-ness of younger- and older-sounding Japanese computer voices. We found that kawaii-ness intersected with perceptions of gender and age, i.e., gender ambiguous and girlish, as well as VA features, i.e., fluency and artificiality. We propose an initial model of kawaii vocalics to be validated through the identification and study of vocal qualities, cognitive appraisals, behavioural responses, and affective reports.

"Combating Toxicity, Harassment, and Abuse in Online Social Spaces: A Workshop at CHI 2023",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573793,0,,"
 Online social spaces provide much needed connection and belonging—particularly in a context of continued lack of global mobility due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and climate crisis. However, the norms of online social spaces can create environments in which toxic behaviour is normalized, tolerated or even celebrated. This can occur without consequence, leaving its members vulnerable to hate, harassment, and abuse. A vast majority of adults have experienced toxicity online and the harm is even more prevalent for members of marginalized and minoritized groups, who are more often the targets of online abuse. Although there is significant work on toxicity in the SIGCHI community, approaches and knowledge have typically been siloed by the domain of investigation (e.g., social media, multiplayer games, social VR). We argue that cross-disciplinary efforts will benefit not only the various communities and situations in which abuse occurs, but that bringing together researchers from different backgrounds and specialties will provide a robust and rich understanding of how to tackle online toxicity at scale.

The notion of energy communities may aid these initiatives as HCI researchers, practitioners, and political organizations argue for their potential benefits. However, envisionments of energy communities carry assumed expectations of a just energy future for community members. This paper presents a case study of a burgeoning energy community where diverse stakeholders reflect on their expectations of a newly established Danish energy cooperative. Through a value-sensitive design study, we identify ten values reflecting social-technical expectations of how the community may be organized and supported by technology in the future. We structure the values into three tenets of energy justice to discuss value tensions regarding the; i) distribution of energy community benefits and threats, ii) enabling energy community engagement, and iii) recognizing the energy community. Lastly, we discuss how HCI may steer technology design toward a just energy future.

 Deep emotional intimacy is a foundational aspect of strong relationships, but the digital tools we use to communicate often limit rather than empower our feelings of connection. Two compelling strategies technologists have used to counteract such trends include games and generative AI art. In this paper, we design and test Closer Worlds, an ML-assisted 2-person game that fosters emotionally intimate conversations through co-creative world-building. We explore design principles inspired by facilitation methods and assess their effectiveness in a pilot study. We find that Closer Worlds elicits some self-disclosure behavior, but less than a social game without generative AI. However, participants clearly enjoy the unique affordances offered by visualizing shared values, which suggests that this method offers a comfortable and novel avenue for meaningful conversations. We conclude by discussing future ways in which co-creative games might leverage generative techniques to foster pro-social environments.

 The field of human-computer interaction (HCI) is maturing.

On this prospect, we argue that our meta-level approach to research within HCI needs a revolution. First, we echo previous calls for greater rigour in primary research reporting with a view towards supporting knowledge synthesis in secondary research. Second, we must decide as a community how to carry out systematic review work in light of the many ways that knowledge is produced within HCI (rigour in secondary research methods and epistemological inclusivity). In short, our manifesto is this: we need to develop and make space for an inclusive but rigorous set of standards that supports systematic review work in HCI, through careful consideration of both primary and secondary research methods, expectations, and infrastructure.

 Recent organizations have started to adopt AI-based decision support tools to optimize human resource development practices, while facing various challenges of using AIs in highly contextual and sensitive domains. We present our case study that aims to help professional assessors make decisions in human assessment, in which they conduct interviews with assessees and evaluate their suitability for certain job roles. Our workshop with two industrial assessors elucidated troubles they face (i.e., maintaining stable and non-subjective observation of assessees’ behaviors) and derived requirements of AI systems (i.e., extracting their nonverbal cues from interview videos in an interpretable manner). In response, we employed an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm using multimodal behavioral features such as facial keypoints, body and head pose, and gaze. The algorithm extracts outlier scenes from the video based on behavioral features as well as informing which feature contributes to the outlierness. We first evaluated how the assessors would perceive the extracted cues and discovered that the algorithm is useful in suggesting scenes to which assessors would pay attention, thanks to its interpretability. Then, we developed an interface prototype incorporating the algorithm and had six assessors use it for their actual assessment. Their comments revealed the effectiveness of introducing unsupervised anomaly detection to enhance their feeling of confidence and objectivity of the assessment along with potential use scenarios of such AI-based systems in human assessment. Our approach, which builds on top of the idea of separating observation and interpretation in human-AI collaboration, will facilitate human decision making in highly contextual domains, such as human assessment, while keeping their trust in the system.

While innovative health technologies have the capacity to better lives, their success hinges, increasingly, on their cybersecurity. Recent years have seen growing awareness of cybersecurity as not only technical but cultural in nature. And yet, how health technologies are developed is also changing — innovation today often led by startups, about whose cybersecurity efforts we know less, and whom might be most at risk. Striving to address this essential gap in knowledge, we present findings from a mixed-methods, design-led study of nine Danish health technology startups and six cybersecurity experts’ experiences. Through analysis of interviews and workshops, we contribute insight into startups’ perceptions of cybersecurity as essential yet often elusive, one amongst many priorities, and often a self-taught discipline. Drawing on this knowledge, we describe the co-design of a self-assessment platform to support increased awareness and preparedness among health technology startups, concluding with implications for future cybersecurity initiatives.

Active media use includes actions such as posting, commenting, and sharing, while passive media use includes simply consuming content without actively participating. We conducted an online survey (N=262) and used Social Cognitive Theory as a framework to investigate how parasocial relationships with BTS members and other factors contribute to active and passive social media use. The results indicated that parasocial relationships were positively related to passive media use, but were not related to active use. Furthermore, guidance needs and community belonging needs were positively related to both active and passive media use, whereas social integrative needs were not related to either type of media use. These findings have implications in terms of understanding how to improve engagement and user experience in social media.

 Goals are fundamental to everyday life and are reflected in the growing HCI research in personal informatics and behaviour change. Besides academic work, a wealth of commercial mobile apps have also been developed to support users in setting their goals and achieving them. Despite their popularity, such apps, however, have been limitedly evaluated. We report a functionality review grounded in auto-ethnography and expert evaluation of the 21 most popular such apps selected from 1336 apps on the Google Play Store. We used a hybrid approach based on goal-setting theory for the evaluation. Findings indicate the more nuanced functionality of goal capturing, extending those explored in previous work for goal setting, monitoring and maintaining motivation. They also highlight the importance of distinguishing between high and low-level goals and their domains since most apps support multiple rather than individual goals. We conclude with design implications to support the setting of multiple personal goals at both high and low levels and across different domains, the use of consistent terms for distinguishing goals at different levels, and for visualizing the relationships among multiple goals.

 Content moderation is a crucial aspect of online platforms, and it requires human moderators (mods) to repeatedly review and remove harmful content. However, this moderation process can lead to cognitive overload and emotional labor for the mods. As new platforms and designs emerge, such as live streaming space, new challenges arise due to the real-time nature of the interactions. In this study, we examined the use of ignoring as a moderation strategy by interviewing 19 Twitch mods. Our findings indicated that ignoring involves complex cognitive processes and significant invisible labor in the decision-making process. Additionally, we found that ignoring is an essential component of real-time moderation. These preliminary findings suggest that ignoring has the potential to be a valuable moderation strategy in future interactive systems, which highlights the need to design better support for ignoring in interactive live-streaming systems.

Is “Categorical Imperative” Metaversal?: A Kantian Ethical Framework for Social Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585911,0,,"
The increasing adoption of social virtual reality (VR) environments for socializing and collaborating with others has led to a growing concern about ethical issues in these immersive environments. Beyond the introduction of some practical guidelines, theoretical work on this topic has been scant. In this paper, we propose an ethical framework for social VR based on Kant’s Theory of Morality. In so doing, we argue that the Kantian concept of categorical imperative does apply to social VR, that the reality of VR is not different from the reality of real life, and that what is morally unacceptable in real life is and should be unacceptable in social VR. In our framework, we provide three principles that can aid users and developers of social VR environments in reasoning about ethical issues in social VR, while advocating for more theoretical approaches to addressing the issue of VR ethics in human-computer interaction circles.

During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people shared their symptoms across Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter, hoping for others’ advice or moral support. Prior studies have shown that those who disclose health-related information across OSNs often tend to regret it and delete their publications afterwards. Hence, deleted posts containing sensitive data can be seen as manifestations of online regrets. In this work, we present an analysis of deleted content on Twitter during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this, we collected more than 3.67 million tweets describing COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, and fatigue) posted between January and April 2020. We observed that around 24% of the tweets containing personal pronouns were deleted either by their authors or by the platform after one year. As a practical application of the resulting dataset, we explored its suitability for the automatic classification of regrettable content on Twitter.

“Do you get déjà vu”: Persuasiveness Effects of Communicating with an Avatar of Similar Appearance in Social Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585839,0,,"
 The similarity effect is a phenomenon whereby people tend to be more influenced by others who resemble them in appearance. It has been found to have many positive impacts, including building trust and promoting collaboration performance. While empirical evidence confirmed that similarity effect operates on screen-based communication platforms, it remains unclear how this phenomenon impacts user perceptions and others’ persuasiveness in immersive virtual reality (VR) environments. In this study, we adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigating how interaction with avatars of similar appearance to one’s own avatar influences conversations. We operationalized similarity as identicality, moderate similarity, and dissimilarity. Avatars of moderate similarity were found to have the greatest persuasiveness; however, in both identicality and moderate similarity conditions, participants felt it was easier to communicate with and lower eeriness rating to avatars than in the dissimilarity condition. We conclude that similarity effect could be leveraged to support persuasiveness in VR-based communication.

Interacting with Masculinities: A Scoping Review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585770,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13558,"
Gender is a hot topic in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Work has run the gamut, from assessing how we embed gender in our computational creations to correcting systemic sexism, online and off. While gender is often framed around women and femininities, we must recognize the genderful nature of humanity, acknowledge the evasiveness of men and masculinities, and avoid burdening women and genderful folk as the central actors and targets of change. Indeed, critical voices have called for a shift in focus to masculinities, not only in terms of privilege, power, and patriarchal harms, but also participation, plurality, and transformation. To this end, I present a 30-year history of masculinities in HCI work through a scoping review of 126 papers published to the ACM Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) conference proceedings. I offer a primer and agenda grounded in the CHI and extant literatures to direct future work.

May I Still Define Myself? Exploring How Dissonance in Displaying Personal Information Through Head-Mounted Augmented Reality Can Affect Personal Information …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585821,0,,"
 Head-mounted Augmented Reality enables individuals to overlay digital information onto the physical world, consequently influencing how they assess and react to augmented social situations. While prior work has shown that augmenting social situations with faithful personal information can benefit a conversation, honest mistakes or an attempt to deceive might lead to a dissonance between augmentation and verbally disclosed information. In this work, we take the first steps towards understanding the happenings in case of information dissonance by conducting a preliminary within-subject online video study (N=30), investigating how it affects users, perception of the interlocutor, and if augmentation or interlocutor would act as the more trusted instance. We found that only 26.7% trusted the interlocutor’s verbally uttered information, while a majority believed the AR device (46.7%) or were undecided (26.7%). We discuss this split in trust and argue for the importance of and factors for a follow-up study on this topic.

How Pricing and Ratings Affect Perceived Value of Digital Detox Apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585681,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditya-Purohit-4/publication/369143346_How_Pricing_and_Ratings_Affect_Perceived_Value_of_Digital_Detox_Apps/links/640cf3c792cfd54f84f24310/How-Pricing-and-Ratings-Affect-Perceived-Value-of-Digital-Detox-Apps.pdf,"
 As the number of mobile apps has exploded over the last decade, different pricing models have emerged (e.g., free, paid, freemium). However, it is not clear how these models affect users’ perceptions of the value of apps that promote behavior change, such as digital detox apps, and what role social ratings play in this relationship. This paper investigates this issue using an experimental approach. The results of a controlled between-subjects experiment (N = 894) suggest that pricing models significantly influence the perceived value of digital detox apps. Digital detox apps using the paid model are perceived to be significantly less valuable than free and freemium apps. No significant difference has been found between free and freemium pricing models. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

 Foundation models (FMs) are a new paradigm in AI. First pretrained on broad data at immense scale and subsequently adapted to more specific tasks, they achieve high performances and unlock powerful new capabilities to be leveraged in many domains, including healthcare. This SIG will bring together researchers and practitioners within the CHI community interested in such emerging technology and healthcare. Drawing attention to the rapid evolution of these models and proposals for their wide-spread adoption, we aim to demonstrate their strengths whilst simultaneously highlighting deficiencies and limitations that give raise to ethical and societal concerns. In particular, we will invite the community to actively debate how the field of HCI – with its research frameworks and methods – can help address some of these existing challenges and mitigate risks to ensure the safe and ethical use of the end-product; a requirement to realize many of the ambitious visions for how these models can positively transform healthcare delivery.

Does Repeatedly Typing the Same Phrase Provide a Good Estimate of Expert Text Entry Performance?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585647,0,https://vvise.iat.sfu.ca/user/data/papers/repeatedtyping.pdf,"
 To identify if novel/unfamiliar keyboard layouts like OPTI can outperform QWERTY, lengthy training through longitudinal studies is typically required. To reduce this logistical bottleneck, a popular approach in the literature requires participants to type the same phrase repeatedly. However, it is still unknown whether this approach provides a good estimate of expert performance. To validate this method, we set up a study where participants were tasked with typing the same phrase 96 times for both OPTI and QWERTY. Results showed that this approach has the potential to estimate expert performance for novel/unfamiliar keyboards faster than the traditional approach with different phrases. Yet, we also found that accurate estimates still require training over several days and, therefore, do not eliminate the need for a longitudinal study. Our findings thus show the need for research on faster, easier, and more reliable empirical approaches to evaluate text entry systems.

MultiViz: Towards User-Centric Visualizations and Interpretations of Multimodal Models,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585604,0,,"
 The nature of human and computer interactions are inherently multimodal, which has led to substantial interest in building interpretable, interactive, and reliable multimodal interfaces. However, modern multimodal models and interfaces are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize their internal workings in order to empower stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model debugging, and promote trust in these models? Our paper proposes MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models via 4 stages: (1) unimodal importance, (2) cross-modal interactions, (3) multimodal representations and (4) multimodal prediction. MultiViz includes modular visualization tools for each stage before combining outputs from all stages through an interactive and human-in-the-loop API. Through user studies with 21 participants on 8 trained models across 6 real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications, and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly available at https://github.com/pliang279/MultiViz, will be regularly updated with new visualization tools and metrics, and welcomes input from the community1.

 In this study, we examined disagreement, agreement, and elaboration (rationale sharing) and their association with idea generation in a crowdsourced deliberation that took place within a crowdsourced policymaking process led by a national government. We analyzed the comments posted to the crowdsourced deliberation process and found that the elaboration of perspectives was a key element in idea generation. Disagreement contributed to ideation most when it was elaborated—i.e., when the participants justified their stances—and when it was accompanied by elaborated agreement. The findings suggest that in the design of the technologies and processes facilitating crowdsourced policymaking and other applications for civic engagement, there should be a particular focus on encouraging elaboration because elaboration can contribute to productive ideation as well as constructive argumentation. Elaboration could be fostered by deploying features from deliberation and argumentation technologies, which are designed to encourage participants to elaborate on their stances.

Investigation of a Pitch Function for Motion-Based VR Bicycle Simulators,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585623,0,,"
 Research on cycling safety and comfort is becoming increasingly relevant in the domain of human-computer interaction. Many studies presented so far have been conducted on static bicycle simulators, which suffer problems of immersion and simulator sickness. Since previous publications on simulator design have suggested a positive effect of simulator tilt (lateral motion), we investigated the potential of simulator pitch (longitudinal motion). N=31 participants completed a test track with multiple flat, up-, and downhill sections while being supported with different pitch modes and a baseline without any motion. Our results suggest only a small impact of simulator pitch on simulator sickness and perceived immersion. However, we found out that study participants adjusted their pedaling strength based on the inclination of the test track, which we attribute to the plausibility illusion in virtual reality. The experiment contributes to the design of virtual reality bicycle simulators at different degrees of fidelity.

 Cycling is emerging as a relevant alternative to cars. However, the more people commute by bicycle, the higher the number of cyclists who use their smartphones on the go and endanger road safety. To better understand input while cycling, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of three text input methods for cyclists: (1) touch input using smartphones, (2) midair input using a Microsoft Hololens 2, and (3) a set of ten physical buttons placed on both sides of the handlebar. We conducted a controlled indoor experiment (N = 12) on a bicycle simulator to evaluate these input methods. We found that text input via touch input was faster and less mentally demanding than input with midair gestures and physical buttons. However, the midair gestures were the least error-prone, and the physical buttons facilitated keeping both hands on the handlebars and were more intuitive and less distracting.

Dis/Immersion in Mindfulness Meditation with a Wandering Voice Assistant,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585627,0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11286,"
Mindfulness meditation is a validated means of helping people manage stress. Voice-based virtual assistants (VAs) in smart speakers, smartphones, and smart environments can assist people in carrying out mindfulness meditation through guided experiences. However, the common fixed location embodiment of VAs makes it difficult to provide intuitive support. In this work, we explored the novel embodiment of a ""wandering voice"" that is co-located with the user and “moves” with the task. We developed a multi-speaker VA embedded in a yoga mat that changes location along the body according to the meditation experience. We conducted a qualitative user study in two sessions, comparing a typical fixed smart speaker to the wandering VA embodiment. Thick descriptions from interviews with twelve people revealed sometimes simultaneous experiences of immersion and dis-immersion. We offer design implications for ""wandering voices"" and a new paradigm for VA embodiment that may extend to guidance tasks in other contexts.

Conducting mental work by interacting with digital technology increases productivity, but strains attentional capacities and mental well-being. In consequence, many mental workers try to cultivate their flow experience. However, this is complex and difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, current technological systems do not yet provide this support in mental work. As interoception, the individual bodily awareness is an underlying mechanism of numerous flow correlates, it might offer a new approach for flow-supporting systems in these scenarios. Results from a survey study with 176 digital workers show that adaptive regulation of interoceptive sensations correlates with higher levels of flow and engagement. Additionally, regular mindfulness practices improved workers' adaptive regulation of bodily signals. Based on these results and integrating the current literature, this work conceptualizes three future technological support systems, such as interoceptive biofeedback, and electrical or auditory stimulation to enhance interoceptive awareness and foster flow in mental work.

Integrating Individual and Social Contexts into Self-Reflection Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573803,0,,"
 Technology for promoting reflection can help people better understand their emotions and thought patterns, eventually motivating them to take action to adopt healthy or productive behaviors. However, existing work has often viewed users individualistically, addressing people’s behaviors and emotions rather than recognizing the external factors that shape them (e.g., economic status, culture). We envision that the individualistic approaches can be extended and reimagined in ways that can consider such broader contexts. We believe such a shift in the design of interventions will help individuals reflect in a more holistic manner, supporting collaborative reflection processes that involve more than one person. With these aims in mind, we will discuss the two questions in our workshop. First, what individual and social contexts should HCI researchers consider while promoting reflection? Second, what role can various forms of technology (e.g., just-in-time adaptive interventions, peer-support platforms) play in supporting and augmenting reflective practices? Through our workshop, we hope to bring together a community of multidisciplinary researchers and practitioners who aim to design and develop reflection interventions that are situated within the fabric of users’ individual and social contexts.

In this late-breaking work, we focus on the case of pronouns translated between English and Japanese in the crowdsourced Tatoeba database. We found that masculine pronoun biases were present overall, even though plurality in language was accounted for in other ways. Importantly, we detected biases in the translation process that reflect nuanced reactions to the presence of feminine, neutral, and/or non-binary pronouns. We raise the issue of translation bias for pronouns and offer a practical solution to embed plurality in NLP data sets.

Participants mainly drew humanoid or robotic AIs. The adjectives that describe AI mainly referred to the inner characteristics, capabilities, shape, or relationship types. Regarding the evaluation, we identified four dimensions (warmth, competence, animacy, size) that can be reproduced for male and female AIs and different AI representations.

We developed ETC (Embodied Telepresent Connection), a prototype that allows two participants to interact remotely through pseudo-haptic touch via their abstract aura avatars. ETC consists of a set of interaction patterns aimed to elicit an illusion of interpersonal touch using embodied metaphors, simulated physics, integration of visuals and sounds, biosignal representation, and embedded social connotations. We showed ETC at 5 events and 3 workshops, observing participants and gathering feedback from them. Here, we report on our design process and initial observations relating to the experience of virtual social touch.

To arrive at a recommended set of reading themes, we combine crowdsourced text adjustments, ML-driven clustering of the resulting text formats, and design sessions. After four iterations of these steps, we converge on a set of three COR (Compact, Open, and Relaxed) themes that are designed for different readers.

 The illusion of consensus occurs when people believe there is consensus across multiple sources, but the sources are the same and thus there is no ""true"" consensus. We explore this phenomenon in the context of an AI-based intelligent agent designed to augment metacognition on social media. Misinformation, especially on platforms like Twitter, is a global problem for which there is currently no good solution. As an explainable AI (XAI) system, the agent provides explanations for its decisions on the misinformed nature of social media content. In this late-breaking study, we explored the roles of trust (attitude) and reliance (behaviour) as key elements of XAI user experience (UX) and whether these influenced the illusion of consensus.

Above-Screen Fingertip Tracking with a Phone in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585728,0,http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/~fdmmatul/pubs/CHI2023LBW.pdf,"
Using a phone as a VR controller is challenging because users cannot see their fingers when aiming for targets on the touchscreen. We propose using two mirrors mounted above the screen that reflect the front camera and a purpose-built deep neural network to robustly infer the 3D position of fingertips manipulating the phone. Network training is self-supervised after only a few initial labelled images and does not require any external sensor. We present a few example scenarios showing potential applications that use our phone-based fingertip tracker for precise touch input and above-screen interaction.

Driving Next to Automated Vehicles: Emergent Human-machine Cooperation in Mixed Traffic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585690,0,,"
Introducing automated vehicles (AVs) on public roads may challenge established norms as drivers in human-driven vehicles (HVs) learn to interact with AVs. Our study utilizes a game theory framework to investigate how driver and vehicle driving styles (aggressive vs. conservative), interaction types (HV-HV vs. HV-AV), scenario types (chicken game vs. public goods game scenarios), and time constraints (high vs. low) influence human drivers’ decision-making in mixed-traffic environments. According to an online survey study, drivers with aggressive driving styles and high time constraints were more likely to take aggressive actions. More importantly, there were significant interaction effects between vehicle driving styles and scenario types, between scenario types and time constraints, and between driver driving styles and interaction types on driver decision-making. Our findings provide essential insights into the design of AVs and promote the development of related laws and policies to facilitate human-machine cooperation in mixed-traffic environments.

Searching for the Whole Truth: Harnessing the Power of Intellectual Humility to Boost Better Search on Debated Topics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585693,0,,"
 We often use search engines when seeking information for opinion-forming and decision-making on debated topics. However, searching for resources on debated topics to gain well-rounded knowledge is cognitively demanding, leaving us vulnerable to cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias. This can impede well-informed decision-making, and on a societal level, snowball to compel extremism and polarization. Most existing approaches to support better search apply nudges that directly modify user behavior. Such interventions bear the risk of harming user autonomy. Here, we discuss the shift we envision towards autonomy-preserving interventions that boost users’ metacognitive skills, specifically their intellectual humility (IH)–the ability to recognize the fallibility of one’s beliefs and the limits of one’s knowledge. While simple interventions to boost IH have shown promise, the effect on users’ search behavior has yet to be investigated. We present critical research questions, challenges, and an initial research plan to advance knowledge in this area.

Exploring the Perception of Pain in Virtual Reality through Perceptual Manipulations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585674,0,https://hal.science/hal-04057864/file/Exploring_the_Perception_of_Pain_in_Virtual_Reality_using_Perceptual_Manipulations.pdf,"
 Perceptual manipulations (PMs) in Virtual Reality (VR) can steer users’ actions (e.g., redirection techniques) and amplify haptic perceptions (e.g., weight). However, their ability to amplify or induce negative perceptions such as physical pain is not well understood. In this work, we explore if PMs can be leveraged to induce the perception of pain, without modifying the physical stimulus. We implemented a VR experience combined with a haptic prototype, simulating the dislocation of a finger. A user study (n=18) compared three conditions (visual-only, haptic-only and combined) on the perception of physical pain and physical discomfort. We observed that using PMs with a haptic device resulted in a significantly higher perception of physical discomfort and an increase in the perception of pain compared to the unmodified sensation (haptic-only). Finally, we discuss how perception of pain can be leveraged in future VR applications and reflect on ethical concerns.

 Sighted and blind and low vision (BLV) creators alike use videos to communicate with broad audiences. Yet, video editing remains inaccessible to BLV creators. Our formative study revealed that current video editing tools make it difficult to access the visual content, assess the visual quality, and efficiently navigate the timeline. We present  AVscript, an accessible text-based video editor.  AVscript enables users to edit their video using a script that embeds the video’s visual content, visual errors (e.g., dark or blurred footage), and speech. Users can also efficiently navigate between scenes and visual errors or locate objects in the frame or spoken words of interest. A comparison study (N=12) showed that  AVscript significantly lowered BLV creators’ mental demands while increasing confidence and independence in video editing. We further demonstrate the potential of  AVscript through an exploratory study (N=3) where BLV creators edited their own footage.

Futuring from an indigenous community stance: projecting temporal duality from the past into the future,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585761,0,,"
 This paper presents the first instance and experience of futuring with a rural San community from the Kalahari desert in Donkerbos, Namibia. Over a series of sessions we explore divergent speculative design and design fiction methods to stimulate and invoke alternative green energy use cases. These alternatives are premised on the imagination of unorthodox green energy use, superseding interventionist energy use which is constantly propagated and mainstream. We showcase the application of speculative design and design fiction in challenging the dominant interventionist approach and singular temporal view, resulting in a dissentient dual temporality. As well as demonstrate its utility and inadequacies in transitioning an African rural indigenous community into the speculative, arguing for the appropriation and widening of futuring methods in an African context.

Motivations for Collecting Digital NFT Fashion: A Uses and Gratifications Theory Approach for Understanding Digital NFT Fashion Collectors' Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585824,0,https://drive.google.com/file/d/13VQMpk1bly1plW8fkn3rTq-UqLs2wxJs/view,"
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow individuals to demonstrate ownership of digital and physical assets. NFTs are scarce, unique, and authentic; three properties known to be key for determining perceived value. Whilst previous research has primarily focused on NFTs as a source of economic value, here we assess the psychological motivations of collectors of digital fashion NFTs. Specifically, NTFs related to digital fashion are particularly relevant to HCI researchers as they sit at the intersection between business, culture, and self-expression. Here, we survey 19 users of a digital avatar fashion company, Genies, to understand the gratifications users derive from collecting digital NFT fashion. Results demonstrate that the primary motivations for collecting fashion NFTs are self-expression and utility and that motivations associated with value are secondary. We make design recommendations based on these results, indicating that developers should distinguish between expression-based motivations and value-based motivations.

A Field Study on Pedestrians' Thoughts toward a Car with Gazing Eyes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585629,0,,"
 It is promising to apply eye-gaze techniques in designing an external human-machine interface (eHMI) for a self-driving car. We can find several prior ""eye"" studies; however, due to the difficulty of running a study in a real environment, prior research was often evaluated in a controlled VR environment. It is unclear how physical eyes on the car affect pedestrians’ thoughts in the real-world outdoor environment. To answer the question, we built and mounted a set of physical eyes of suitable size for a real car, drove the car in a public open space, activated the physical eyes, and performed the eye-gaze interaction with pedestrians without providing them any prior explanation. We administered a questionnaire to collect pedestrians’ thoughts and conducted a thematic (inductive) analysis. By comparing our findings to the previous results through a literature review, we highlighted the significance of physical implementation of the ""eye concept"" for future research.

 With the fast evolution of Virtual Reality (vr) technology, new prospects opened for embodied learning. Learners can now manipulate digital representations of abstract concepts and make sense of them through sensorimotor stimulation. However, in research, embodiment is explored from several perspectives, which, we argue, should be considered within a same framework. In this paper, we describe three major perspectives relevant for embodied learning in Virtual Reality (vr): embodied cognition, embodied interaction, and avatar embodiment. We organize these perspectives within one common interdisciplinary framework, and discuss resulting design opportunities for vr embodied learning interactions. Specifically, we show that embodied interaction does not necessarily support embodied cognition, and that breaking recommendations of avatar embodiment can actually support meaning-making. We believe our work offers novel avenues for future research and will foster interesting conversations in the hci community.

 We contribute interaction techniques for augmenting mixed reality (MR) visualizations with smartphone proxies. By combining head-mounted displays (HMDs) with mobile touchscreens, we can augment low-resolution holographic 3D charts with precise touch input, haptics feedback, high-resolution 2D graphics, and physical manipulation. Our approach aims to complement both MR and physical visualizations. Most current MR visualizations suffer from unreliable tracking, low visual resolution, and imprecise input. Data physicalizations on the other hand, although allowing for natural physical manipulation, are limited in dynamic and interactive modification. We demonstrate how mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets can serve as physical proxies for MR data interactions, creating dynamic visualizations that support precise manipulation and rich input and output. We describe 6 interaction techniques that leverage the combined physicality, sensing, and output capabilities of HMDs and smartphones, and demonstrate those interactions via a prototype system. Based on an evaluation, we outline opportunities for combining the advantages of both MR and physical charts.

 Regularity in daily activities has been linked to positive well-being outcomes, but previous studies have mainly focused on clinical populations and traditional daily activities such as sleep and exercise. This research extends prior work by examining the regularity of both self-reported and digital activities of 49 information workers in a 4-week naturalistic study. Our findings suggest that greater variability in self-reported mood, job demands, lunch time, and sleep quality may be associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression. However, when it comes to digital activity-based measures, greater variability in rhythm is associated with reduced emotional distress. This study expands our understanding of workers and the potential insights that can be gained from analyzing technology interactions and well-being.

Breathing based immersive interactions for enhanced agency and body awareness: a claustrophobia motivated study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585897,0,,"
This work explores utilizing representations of one’s physiological breath (embreathment) in immersive experiences, for enhancing presence and body awareness. Particularly, embreathment is proposed for reducing claustrophobia and associated negative cognitions such as feelings of restriction, loss of agency, and sense of suffocation, by enhancing agency and interoception in circumstances where one’s ability to act is restricted. The informed design process of an experience designed for this purpose is presented, alongside an experiment employing the experience, evaluating embodiment, presence, and interoception. The results indicate that embreathment leads to significantly greater levels of embodiment and presence than either an entrainment or control condition. In addition, a modest trend was observed in a heartbeat detection task implying better interoception in the intervention conditions than the control. These findings support the initial assumptions regarding presence and body awareness, paving the way for further evaluation with individuals and situations related to the claustrophobia use case.

 As Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers, we can create digital tools which facilitate growth, liberate, and heal, or create tools for trauma, discrimination, and increasing social power divides. Thus, it is extremely important to follow intersectionally grounded, qualitatively sound approaches with a diversity of participants situated across different axes of oppression, not only to improve the effectiveness of our explicit interfaces, but also to change the implicit messages and power structures we encode in them. The outcome of this paper, which represents a middle step between several larger studies, is twofold: a definition of the research methodology used to more accurately study bias in gamification in education, and outreach to potential study participants for the followup study. From current literature on the effects of (mis)representation, inaccessible and harmful designs, and oppressive technologies in HCI, we see that a crucial step in HCI research around gamified education tools is missing: the experiences, stories, and design input of marginalised students.

 Learning, or addressing a gap in one’s knowledge, is an important motivator behind information-seeking activities. The Search as Learning research community advocates for transforming information search systems into educational platforms to support learning and sensemaking. Current search systems have yet to adapt to this function. One crucial step is identifying behavioural patterns that distinguish individuals who gain more knowledge from those who gain less. Previous research has mainly focused on short-term, laboratory-based studies of human-information interaction, which researchers believe is insufficient for understanding the prolonged process of learning. In response, we conducted LongSAL, an exploratory longitudinal study examining the long-term information searching behaviour of university students over a semester. Our preliminary results indicate that participants with higher levels of metacognition and self-regulation exhibit greater efficiency in their searching as learning process. Specifically, they visit fewer webpages, and spend less time dwelling on them, yet receive similar grades compared to participants who spend more time dwelling, and visiting more webpages. These findings will help develop improved search systems that foster learning and sensemaking.

 Adaptive mixed reality applications adjust their user interfaces based on the context in which they are used to provide a smooth experience for different users and environments. This involves carefully positioning UI elements, which can be challenging due to the many possible placements and need to balance competing goals. Current approaches employ global criterion optimization methods like weighted sums, which can be difficult to use, inflexible, and might not find preferred solutions. This can prevent the adaptations from meeting end-user expectations. We suggest using online multi-objective optimization methods which generate a set of Pareto optimal adaptation proposals, giving users more control and adding flexibility to the computational decision-making. We explore the feasibility of our approach by generating adaptations for a basic synthetic example and discuss relevant dimensions for a formal evaluation with end-users, including the choice of algorithm, decomposition technique, and objectives.

 We report a mixed-design study on the effect of facial animation method (static, synthesized, or tracked expressions) and its synchronization to speaker audio (in sync or delayed by the method’s inherent latency) on an avatar’s perceived naturalness and plausibility. We created a virtual human for an actor and recorded his spontaneous half-minute responses to conversation prompts. As a simulated immersive interaction, 44 participants unfamiliar with the actor observed and rated performances rendered with the avatar, each with the different facial animation methods. Half of them observed performances in sync and the others with the animation method’s latency. Results show audio synchronization did not influence ratings and static faces were rated less natural and less plausible than animated faces. Notably, synthesized expressions were rated as more natural and more plausible than tracked expressions. Moreover, ratings of verbal behavior naturalness differed in the same way. We discuss implications of these results for avatar-mediated communication.

In this paper we describe a pilot study aimed at exploring the potential for including social learning in an adaptive system. Our analysis of the social learning scale demonstrates its validity and usefulness for our ongoing work. Our qualitative analysis of students’ learning demonstrates how social learning vary among students. We discuss how the rating scale results and observations of social learning can be integrated within a student model needed to drive an adaptive system. More generally, our work illustrates how theories of learning can contribute to the design of adaptive learning systems.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 aged care workers and technology providers to investigate the challenges and opportunities of deploying technologies in aged care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlighted that technologies such as videoconferencing and smart displays connected residents with family and friends, kept families informed and reassured, and were used in small groups to meet individual needs. However, limitations in video calling, staff fatigue, volunteer availability, and infrastructural resources presented barriers to technology deployment. Future use of technology for social connection in aged care requires careful facilitation from staff, better resourcing and infrastructural support, collaborations with volunteers, and more attention to individual needs.

 Human-level commonsense reasoning capability is vital for human-AI interaction, enabling AI to understand, anticipate, and respond to human’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

The field of cognitive science, child development, and explainable AI have long recognized the importance of explanations for sharing knowledge and resolving contradictions. We, therefore, raise the question: can AIs leverage the power of explanations to learn human-level commonsense reasoning? More specifically, can explanatory dialogue with children help AIs to develop commonsense reasoning capabilities?

 Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) are said to become part of our streets, however, their introduction raises certain challenges for vulnerable road users when it comes to making confident street-crossing decisions. To mitigate such concerns, researchers have proposed novel external human-machine interfaces (eHMI) that transmit vehicle intent and awareness information to pedestrians. However, many proposed eHMIs are limited to being deployed on vehicles or street infrastructures, and therefore offer limited opportunities to provide more personal forms of feedback to diverse pedestrians. In this work, we introduce a new category of eHMIs, pedestrian-wearables, which include clothing- and accessories-based devices that provide information about AVs directly to pedestrians. We report on a study wherein participants proposed designs for pedestrian-wearables that provide relevant alerts to wearers and help them make safer street-crossing decisions. Informed by our participants’ designs, we discuss three main facets of pedestrian-wearables: their perceived strengths and potential for inclusiveness and social acceptability.

 This workshop focuses on remote care and wellbeing as we transition into a world increasingly adopting hybrid lifestyles and modes of operation. Care and care work have predominantly been researched in traditionally in-person interpersonal contexts. The burgeoning uptake and incorporation of information and communication technologies towards remote care have created new workflows and resulted in emerging questions around the definitions and scope of care practice in response. The confluence of technological, sociocultural, geopolitical, and climatic realities of the current day brings into focus the need to unpack the idea of “care,” and the role that HCI researchers could play in creating equitable futures of remote and hybrid care. This workshop will focus on questions such as “What does holistic wellbeing look like in the era of hybrid caregiving?” and “How does environmental care factor into our research practice?” We invite researchers and practitioners from academia and industry in this workshop to reflect on these questions and advance the future of remote care work at CHI.

Enhancing ESL Learners' Experience and Performance through Gradual Adjustment of Video Speed during Extensive Viewing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585804,0,,"
 Learning different languages is a trend among global learners as it improves international communication. One way to learn a second language outside the classroom is through extensive viewing, which helps learners become more familiar with the target language. However, previous research has suggested that directly adjusting the video speed can disrupt learning. This study explores whether gradually adjusting the speed instead can alleviate these disruptions. We conducted an experiment (N=32) with English-as-a-second-language (ESL) participants to compare the cognitive load, flow state, and video comprehension when using the direct and gradual speed adjustment methods to accelerate or decelerate videos. Using both objective measurements, including pupil diameter, and subjective surveys, we found that the gradual method resulted in a higher flow state and improved video comprehension. These findings suggest potential directions for future research on the effects of speed adjustments on ESL learners during extensive viewing.

This paper goes beyond the current empowerment discourse in the SIGCHI community to address how we primarily focus on research and design contexts and technological contributions. It argues that existing literature on empowerment does not fully account for the complexity of marginalized communities, including factors such as poverty, lack of digital literacy, or access to technology, which can affect a community’s decision to participate in research and their effectiveness during participation. The paper presents two provocations: 1) research must adopt methods of partnership that empower the community, and 2) researchers must consider how empowerment is sustained both within and outside of research and design settings and technological contributions. The paper concludes with a call to action for a holistic empowerment strategy within HCI to stimulate further discussion on empowering marginalized communities beyond research and design.

Advances in deep learning showed that convolutional networks can learn powerful time-series patterns while showing classification decisions and feature importances. We present a novel convolution-based model that classifies emotions robustly. Our model not only offers high emotion-prediction performance but also enables transparency on the model decisions. Our solution thereby provides a time-aware feature interpretation of classification decisions using saliency maps. We evaluate the system on a contextual, real-world driving dataset involving twelve participants. Our model achieves a mean accuracy of in 5-class emotion classification on unknown roads and outperforms in-car facial expression recognition by . We conclude how emotion prediction can be improved by incorporating emotion sensing into interactive computing systems.

Exploring Tangible User Interface Design for Social Connection Among Older Adults: A Preliminary Review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585722,1,,"
 Older adults (aged 65 or above) are the fastest growing section of the population and increasing number of older adults are reporting of social isolation. WHO recognizes social engagement as an important factor for reducing isolation among older adults. Researchers have historically investigated digital technologies to build connections, but they involve disadvantages like accessibility issues and have not been a good match for the aged population. In this paper, we investigate existing work that focuses on improving social connections among older adults and then explore the potential of tangible user interaction as an alternate solution. We conclude the paper with design consideration for HCI researchers working in the space of tangible user interface design for older adults. This paper is a preliminary review towards opening a conversation about the suitability of tangible design for older adults in improving social connection.

Doodle away: an autoethnographic exploration of doodling as a strategy for self-control strength in online spaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3582747,0,,"
 We think we are not alone when we say: navigating the new online spaces surrounding us is more difficult than we could have predicted. In this paper, we explore doodling as a tool for self-control while attending passive online spaces. We, four researchers in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, engaged in doodling during our online meetings, seminars, and conferences. We also kept an autoethnographic diary along with a collection of our doodles. We reflected and then discussed through affinity diagramming, whereby five themes were developed: More than human, Designerly ways of sketching, Traces of time and space, Emotional aesthetics & thoughts, Sketching materials, techniques, and tangible characteristics. We conclude by inviting the HCI community to contribute with their doodles during the CHI2023 conference in Hamburg or remotely.

Emerging Transdisciplinary Perspectives to Confront Dark Patterns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3583745,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Colin-Gray-2/publication/368635722_Emerging_Transdisciplinary_Perspectives_to_Confront_Dark_Patterns/links/63f0f7d731cb6a6d1d1220b5/Emerging-Transdisciplinary-Perspectives-to-Confront-Dark-Patterns.pdf,"
 Technology ethics is increasingly at the forefront of human-computer interaction scholarship, with increasing visibility not only to end users of technology, but also regulators, technology practitioners, and platforms. The notion of “dark patterns” has emerged as one common framing of technology manipulation, describing instances where psychological or perceptual tricks are used to decrease user agency and autonomy. In this panel, we have assembled a group of highly diverse early-career scholars that have built a transdisciplinary approach to scholarship on dark patterns, engaging with a range of socio-technical approaches and perspectives. Panelists will discuss their methodological approaches, key research questions to be considered in this emerging area of scholarship, and necessary connections between and among disciplinary perspectives to engage with the diverse constituencies that frame the creation, use, and impacts of dark patterns.

A Study on User Perception and Experience Differences in Recommendation Results by Domain Expertise: The Case of Fashion Domains,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3585641,0,,"
 To improve user satisfaction to the recommender systems (RS), it is essential to identify how users would perceive the system and what recommendation results they would prefer. Domain experts also use RS that relate to their work and decision-making, but existing studies have primarily focused on user experience from the general public and somewhat neglected the degree of user perception, understanding, and preference to the RS according to domain knowledge and interest and recommendation algorithm types. In this paper, we present My Own Style (MOS), a dashboard tool designed to analyze a given input fashion image and recommend outfit based on three recommendation algorithms that have different degrees of similarity and diversity. Based on the results from a large-scale user study with 166 participants, our results showed that the participants who have high fashion knowledge and interest (i.e., domain experts) well understood the results of RS and preferred the recommendation algorithm that provides similar outfit, while those who have low fashion knowledge and interest did not well understand the recommendation results as much as the expert group and preferred the algorithm that suggests diverse outfit. Our work is meaningful in providing empirical evidence on how to develop, select, and utilize recommendation algorithms according to domain expertise.

Identifying challenges and opportunities for intelligent data-driven health interfaces to support ongoing care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544549.3573798,0,https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/159010/1/3544549.3573798.pdf,"
 This workshop will explore future work in the area of intelligent, conversational, data-driven health interfaces both from patients’ and health care professionals’ perspectives. We aim to bring together a diverse set of experts and stakeholders to jointly discuss the opportunities and challenges at the intersection of public health care provisioning, patient and caretaker empowerment, monitoring provisioning of health care and its quality. This will require AI-supported, conversational decision-making interfaces that adhere to ethical and privacy standards and address issues around agency, control, engagement, motivation, and accessibility. The goal of the workshop is to create a community around intelligent data-driven interfaces and create a road map for their future research.

"Doufu, Rice Wine, and 面饼: Supporting the Connections between Precision and Cultural Knowledge in Cooking",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580697,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3580697,"
The digital codification and measurement of food preparation has made strong contributions to HCI food research, whether through ingredient manipulation, workflow management, or recipe interaction. But prior work has shown that technical developments that emphasize precise gourmet practices tend to overlook the importance of cultural knowledge. Drawing on an integrative autobiographical design approach, we describe an open-source hardware toolkit that we developed to examine the process of integrating precision techniques with ritual cooking practices across three recipes: flour skin, rice wine, and doufu. Our work points to the importance of understanding precision as a cultural process with roots in personal and familial experience. We end with a reflection on the particular knowledge-forms that come from cultivating cultural relationships to fabrication processes and their implications for reading digital fabrication processes as meaningfully relational.
